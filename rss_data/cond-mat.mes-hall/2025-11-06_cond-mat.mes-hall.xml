      <title>Dynamics of excitons in CdSe nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to calculate the linear and nonlinear optical functions of CdSe nanoplatelets, taking into account the effect of a dielectric confinement on excitonic states. We consider both stationary and non-stationary excitation regime. We obtain obtain analytical expressions for the absorption coefficient, the exciton resonance energy and binding energy of nanoplatelets. The impact of plate geometry (thickness, lateral dimension) on the spectrum is discussed. In the nonlinear case we analyze the impact of temperature. For the short-pulse excitation the time dependence of the spectra is considered. The results are compared with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cu2O Rydberg Excitons -- Kerr Effect and Quantum Beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear refraction and the nonlinear Kerr phase shift which are due to Rydberg excitons induced in Cu2O crystal by short-time pulses. We observe the phenomenon of quantum beats, analogous to that observed in exciton emission spectra, obtained in the same conditions. The calculated temporal evolution show dependence on the exciton state number, the applied laser power, and quantities related to dissipative processes.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the extrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) to be comparable to the intrinsic one in roughly half of the altermagnetic spin Laue groups in the limit of large exchange splitting. In materials with a finite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interaction, the extrinsic contribution is essential even in the clean limit. In other altermagnets it is mostly negligible. This peculiar behavior is linked to the nonanalytic dependence of the intrinsic AHC on spin-orbit coupling. Both originate from the lifting of the spin degeneracy along the nodal planes as the weak spin-orbit coupling breaks the nonrelativistic spin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Skew Scattering Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials with broken inversion symmetry, nonreciprocal magneto-transport (NRMT) manifests as a bilinear dependence of charge conductivity on applied electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in symmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel rectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies generally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic scaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT microscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the discovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges from the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical field effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over other possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba splitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it unveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a universal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time in topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation rectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Giant field-tunable nonlinear Hall effect by Lorentz skew scattering in a graphene moire superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\mu}mV-1{\Omega}-1) near van Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient, magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond electrostatic gating.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Slot Plasma Excitations in a AlGaN/GaN Plasmonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the terahertz spectrum of plasma excitations in a plasmonic crystal based on AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron system (2DES). While screened plasmon modes with linear dispersion are readily observed in the plasmonic crystals, the existence of unscreened modes localized in the slots between the gates has remained unobserved until now. We discover this slot plasma excitation exhibiting square-root dispersion. It turned out that these slot plasmons follow an unconventional wave-vector quantization rule, $q_u=(N + 1/4) \times \pi/l_u$ for even integers $N$, and require the condition for excitation $q_u h \ll 1$, where $h$ is the gate-to-2DES distance and $l_u$ is the slot width. We develop an analytical model that accurately captures the found dispersion and relaxation, revealing a non-trivial $-\pi/4$ phase shift upon plasmon reflection at the gate edge. Experiments demonstrate that the slot plasmons persist up to room temperature, thereby enabling a broad range of opportunities for the advancement of plasmonic devices.</description>

      <title>Switching perpendicular magnets for Processing-in-memory with voltage gated Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data transfer latency by rolling memory and logic elements into one compute location. As an emergent material candidate for such an architecture, we propose a strained Weyl semimetal based spin-orbit-torque random-access memory (SWSM-SOTRAM) device. The spin-orbit torque (SOT) originates from two mechanisms: (1) the inverse spin Galvanic effect (iSGE), which generates nonequilibrium in-plane spin accumulation at interfaces, and (2) a bulk spin Hall effect (SHE), which produces a transverse spin current carrying out-of-plane spin angular momentum. The latter is tunable via an exchange Zeeman field. Both effects are evaluated using the tight-binding model coupled with a nonequilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF) formalism for quantum transport. Information write is achieved through SOT switching of an out-of-plane free magnet. A piezo attached to a magnetostrictive selector modulates the strain in the latter, leading to the rotation of the magnetization and hence the exchange Zeeman field exerted on the Weyl semimetal. This strain-controlled exchange field enables the symmetry tuning of the Weyl semimetal and modulation of its spin Hall effect. The TB-NEGF calculations of SHE and iSGE, combined with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of magnetization dynamics, establish the SOT switching mechanism and demonstrate a pathway toward the SWSM-SOTRAM PIM device.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonon Negative Refraction via Interfacial Momentum Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative refraction of coherent phonons is crucial for thermal management and quantum information processing, but it remains unrealized because achieving the suitable dispersion for negative refraction simultaneously with long-range coherence is challenging. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching, resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Elimination of the acoustoelectric domain and increasing of the emission intensity by means of shunting the lateral current in the InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been experimentally implemented a technique of neutralization of an acoustoelectric domain under the conditions of the lateral transport of charge carriers in strong electric fields in the multilayer InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures with quantum wells. The technique is implemented by means of deposition of a shunting semi opaque silver film on the heterostructure surface between the ohmic contacts. In absence of shunting the domain appearance leads to current decrease, current oscillations and also to a strong decrease of the band-to-band emission during a voltage pulse applied to the sample. The shunting eliminated the current decrease and enabled it to strongly enlarge the band-to-band emission intensity.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable single terahertz meta-atom ultrastrong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator (cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to $\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature entropies and possible states in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$, $FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Depth-resolved low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) was used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ value are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, indicating that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.</description>

      <title>Mysterious Role of Cap Configuration in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Catalytic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the role of cap structure during the nucleation and growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is essential for achieving chirality-controlled synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel and intuitive algorithm to determine the chirality of nascent carbon caps by tracking the relative shifts of six pentagons within a topological coordinate system. Based on this algorithm, we propose three routes of pentagon shifts for the chirality mutations from armchair (AC) to near-AC caps, namely the transverse shift (n,n) to (n+1,n-1), inward shift (n,n) to (n-1), and outward shift (n,n) to (n+1,n), can occur according to the energy profiles calculated based on the density function theory (DFT), providing a new perspective to explain the experimental abundance of near-AC SWCNTs. After that, we construct 24 representative short caps and long SWCNTs with different chiralities and symmetries, and perform DFT calculations to evaluate their thermodynamic stability and deformation behaviors on flat Ni(111) surfaces and curved Ni55 particle, respectively. The results reveal that cap topology and catalyst curvature together induce dual deformations that significantly influence the formation and interface energies. Notably, AC and near-AC caps exhibit superior flexibility and robust energetic advantages, especially the (6,6) cap with C6v symmetry. A linear correlation between cap-induced deformation and formation energy is established through a defined shape factor, highlighting the interaction between cap structure and catalyst interface as a key driver of chirality selection. This study theoretically reveals the cap evolution mechanism and lays the foundation for the rational design of SWCNT growth strategies.</description>

      <title>Incorporating QM/MM molecular dynamics into the few-mode quantization approach for light-matter interactions in nanophotonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of light-matter interactions between organic chromophores and confined photons of (plasmonic) nano-resonators, we introduce a general framework that couples ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics with few-mode field quantization to simulate light-matter interactions of molecular emitters at the nanoscale. Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly. Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system.</description>

Abstract: Coherent detection and interferometry in the terahertz (THz) regime are key capabilities that enable applications ranging from astronomy to non-destructive testing. Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength thickness accuracy of $\sim$5 $\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10 nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity - without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation wireless communication, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e modulated quantum spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids. This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid candidates such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work, we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material 1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We observe the emergence of a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are consistent with a modulated $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state. Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\'e modulations on potential quantum liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes, i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when including perturbations.</description>

      <title>Force-Based Reading and Writing of Individual Single-Atom Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of single-atom bits enables the realization of the highest data-density memory. Reading and writing information to these bits through mechanical interactions opens the possibility of operating the magnetic devices with low heat generation and high density recording. To achieve this visionary goal, we demonstrate the use of magnetic exchange force microscopy to read and write the spin orientation of individual holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The spin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial anisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange forces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be written by approaching the tip closer to the holmium adatom.We explain this writing mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho adatom. These findings demonstrate the potential for information storage with minimal energy loss and pave the way for a new field of atomic-scale mechano-spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study abelian anyons at the mean-field/almost-bosonic level, whose dynamics are governed by the Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger system. We consider the dimensional reduction of this 2D model by introducing an anisotropic trapping potential, and derive an effective 1D model after tracing out the tight confinement direction. The resulting effective dynamics in the loose confinement direction is captured by a quintic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We rigorously establish this dimensional reduction process in the sense of ground state energies and time-dependent solutions, under an $H^2$ well-posedness assumption.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>

      <title>Single photon emitters in hBN: Limitations of atomic resolution imaging and potential sources of error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in identifying the origin of single-photon emission in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with proposed candidates including boron and nitrogen vacancies as well as carbon substitutional dopants. Because photon emission intensity often increases with sample thickness, hBN flakes used in these studies commonly exceed 30 atomic layers. To identify potential emitters at the atomic scale, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) is frequently employed. However, due to the intrinsic AA' stacking of hBN with vertically alternating boron and nitrogen atoms, this approach is complicated even in few-layer systems. Here, we demonstrate using STEM image simulations and experiments that, even under idealized conditions, the intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic layers (ca. 6 nm). While vacancy-type defects can remain detectable at somewhat larger thicknesses, also their detection becomes unreliable at thicknesses typically used in photonic studies. We further show that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial contrast differences between columns, which may result in misidentification of atomic defects. We systematically study the effects of non-radially symmetric aberrations on multilayer hBN and demonstrate that even small residual threefold astigmatism can significantly distort the STEM contrast, leading to misleading interpretations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum conductors attached to metallic reservoirs have been demonstrated to overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), a trade-off relation between the amount of dissipation and the absence of charge and heat current fluctuations. Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting reservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport processes, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their retro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal quasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns. The large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative and highly stable quantum thermal machines.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental advancements in dissipation control have yielded significant insights into non-hermitian Hamiltonians for open quantum systems. Of particular interest are the topological characteristics exhibited by these non-hermitian systems, that arise from exceptional points - distinct degeneracies unique to such systems. In this study, we focus on Andreev bound states in multiterminal Josephson junctions with non-hermiticity induced by normal metal or ferromagnetic leads. By investigating several systems of different synthetic dimensions and symmetries, we predict fragile and stable non-hermitian topological phases in these engineered superconducting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ hosts isolated flat Chern bands at the Fermi level in its $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic ground state. Their flatness and nontrivial topology arise from the cooperative effect of coplanar spin order and strong spin-orbit coupling within Re $5d$ orbitals-a mechanism distinct from moir\'e systems. The spiral spin texture naturally enlarges the unit cell, reducing carrier densities while preserving sizable interaction scales. Many-body calculations show that fractional fillings can support fractional Chern insulator and charge-density wave states. Remarkably, the mechanism is generic to a broad family of Re-based compounds, with both spin configuration and flat band topology tunable by electrical manipulation. Our findings establish Re-based coplanar antiferromagnets as a robust, tunable, and experimentally accessible platform for flat Chern bands and correlated topological phases potentially at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Orbital Description of Landau Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of a lattice analogue for Landau levels has been a central theme in condensed matter physics. Although the correspondence between Chern bands and the lowest Landau level has been widely studied, a lattice realization of the first Landau level remains elusive. Here we construct a minimal lattice model that provides a concrete orbital description of both the lowest and first Landau levels. Using maximally localized Wannier functions with $s$, $p_-$, and $p_+$ orbital character, we develop a three-orbital model in which the two lowest Chern bands are flat and each carries a Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. The band topology arises from a sequence of ideal band inversions between Wannier states at the $\Gamma$ and $K$ points in momentum space, establishing an adiabatic connection between the atomic insulator limit and Landau level physics. Notably, many-body exact diagonalization reveals that the non-Abelian state can appear in the half-filled first Chern band. This construction can be further generalized to realize flat Chern bands analogous to higher Landau levels. Our results provide a new perspective on lattice analogues of Landau levels and may enable the exploration of fascinating topological phenomena at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of Bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ Lattice Induced by Polarized Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of photon-dressed energy bands in bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices under off-resonant circularly polarized light, focusing on aligned and cyclic stacking configurations. Analytical expressions for quasi-energy bands are derived for aligned stacking, while numerical results address cyclic stacking at Dirac points. Circularly polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracies at the intersections $t^{a,c}$, leading to the appearance of a Haldane-type Chern insulator in the absence of a magnetic field . At $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, orbital magnetic moments of corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, as do their Berry curvatures. For $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, light-induced band deformations near Dirac points create gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum, where the chemical potential modulates orbital magnetization. Linear magnetization variations align with Chern numbers, yielding quantized anomalous Hall conductivity across stacking types. Notable particle-hole symmetry breaking within $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ suggests applications in valley caloritronics and quantum sensing. At $\alpha = 1$, flat and corrugated bands remain undistorted; while the flat band contributes no Berry curvature, it produces a finite negative orbital magnetic moment, contrasting with the positive moment of the corrugated band.</description>

Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that rapidly simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and other scanning probe microscopy (SPM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sublattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and several charge- and bond-density wave systems.</description>

Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can host exceptional degeneracies where not only the eigenvalues, but also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recently, $p$-wave magnets have been introduced, which are characterized by their unusual odd parity. In this work, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian degeneracies at the interface of $p$-wave magnets and ferromagnets. We demonstrate that this setup offers a remarkable tunability allowing realization of exceptional lines and rings, which can be controlled via the orientation of the $p$-wave N\'eel vector. We present the origin of these exceptional contours based on symmetry, and characterize them using phase rigidity. Our works puts forward a versatile platform to realize controllable non-Hermitian degeneracies at odd parity magnetic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Theoretical Framework for Third-Order Nonlinear Susceptibility in CdSe/ZnS--MOF Quantum Dot Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully theoretical and self consistent framework for calculating the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of CdSe/ZnS--MOF composite quantum dots. The approach unifies finite-potential quantum confinement,the Liouville von Neumann density matrix expansion to third order, and effective-medium electrodynamics (Maxwell--Garnett and Bruggeman) within a single Hamiltonian-based model, requiring no empirical fitting. Electron hole quantized states and dipole matrix elements are obtained under the effective-mass approximation with BenDaniel--Duke boundary conditions; closed analytic forms for(including Lorentzian/Voigt broadening) follow from the response expansion. Homogenization yields macroscopic scaling laws that link microscopic descriptors (core radius, shell thickness, dielectric mismatch) to bulk coefficients and. A Kramers--Kronig consistency check confirms causality and analyticity of the computed spectra with small residuals. The formalism provides a predictive, parameter-transparent route to engineer third-order nonlinearity in hybrid quantum materials,clarifying how size and environment govern the magnitude and dispersion of.</description>

      <title>Quartet Tomography in Multiterminal Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of quartets in hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions. Using simple models of quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads, we find that quartets are ubiquitous and show how to rigorously extract their contribution to the current-phase relation (CPR). We also demonstrate that quartets are closely related to the hybridization of Andreev bound states (ABSs) in these systems and propose a method to identify quartets directly in ABS spectra. We illustrate our method by analyzing the spectroscopic measurements of the ABS spectrum in a three-terminal Josephson junction realized in an InAs/Al heterostructure. Our analysis strongly suggests the existence of quartets in the studied hybrid system.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit DC gates over an inhomogeneous array of quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of large-scale quantum computation with an integrated chip of spin qubits is imminent as technology improves. This invites us to think beyond the traditional 2-qubit-gate framework and consider a naturally supported ``instruction set'' of multi-qubit gates. In this work, we systematically study such a family of multi-qubit gates implementable over an array of quantum dots by DC evolution. A useful representation of the computational Hamiltonian is proposed for a dot-array with strong spin-orbit coupling effects, distinctive $g$-factor tensors and varying interdot couplings. Adopting a perturbative treatment, we model a multi-qubit DC gate by the first-order dynamics in the qubit frame and develop a detailed formalism for decomposing the resulting gate, estimating and optimizing the coherent gate errors with appropriate local phase shifts for arbitrary array connectivity. Examples of such multi-qubit gates and their applications in quantum error correction and quantum algorithms are also explored, demonstrating their potential advantage in accelerating complex tasks and reducing overall errors.</description>

      <title>Probing Intrinsic Elastic Properties of Multilayer Graphene - a New Mechanical Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present measurements on in-plane Young's modulus and the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter of multilayer graphene with varying number of layers, obtained through {\it in situ} bulge tests. Accurate determination of their elastic parameters poses a significant experimental challenge due to the substantial differences in mechanical behavior between intra- and inter-layers. To address this, we develop a novel theoretical model with first-principles calculations to investigate thickness-dependent incomplete strain transfer between the layers. Our findings show that the experimentally measured elastic constants, which deviate from computed intrinsic values, fail to fully capture ideal mechanical couplings between layers. As a solution, we propose a new mechanical modulus that integrates the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter and in-plane Young's modulus, providing a more reliable representation of their mechanical properties, independent of unavoidable interlayer effects.</description>

      <title>The structural effects of (111) growth of La2CoMnO6 on SrTiO3 and LSAT -- new insights from 3D crystallographic characterisation with 4D-STEM and Digital Dark Field imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 3-dimensional orientation of La atom modulations has been mapped in two thin films of La2CoMnO6 grown on SrTiO3 and LSAT ([La,Sr,Al,Ta] oxide) using a 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) method based on the recently developed Digital Dark Field method. This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra in the film grown on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze the amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

      <title>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>
