      <title>Uncertainty quantification of reacting fluids interacting with porous media using a hybrid physics-based and data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately simulating coupled physical processes under uncertainty is essential for reliable modeling and design in performance-critical applications such as combustion systems. Ablative heat shield design, as a specific example of this class, involves modeling multi-physics interactions between reacting flows and a porous material. Repeatedly evaluating these models to quantify parametric uncertainties would be prohibitively computationally expensive. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling using a single-domain approach with data-driven reduced-order modeling to quantify uncertainty via the operator inference method. The detailed physics-based simulations reproduce the measured surface temperature of an object exposed to high-enthalpy flow in a plasma wind tunnel experiment within 5%. We further use the model to demonstrate the effect of complex flow situations on the dynamic interactions between the porous heat shield material and the surrounding gas. The parametric reduced-order model, built on physics-based simulation data, successfully captures variations in quantities of interest resulting from changes in the permeability and heat transfer coefficient of the porous material in two separate studies: solid fuel combustion and emission of buoyant reacting plumes in quiescent air and ablation in a wind tunnel.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving MHD-Driftkinetic Discretization for Wave-Particle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python package \texttt{STRUPHY}. Numerical experiments confirm the energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04917v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>

      <title>Fast frequency reconstruction using Deep Learning for event recognition in ring laser data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of a frequency with minimal delay from a sinusoidal signal is a common task in several fields; for example Ring Laser Gyroscopes, since their output signal is a beat frequency. While conventional methods require several seconds of data, we present a neural network approach capable of reconstructing frequencies of several hundred Hertz within approximately 10 milliseconds. This enables rapid trigger generation. The method outperforms standard Fourier-based techniques, improving frequency estimation precision by a factor of 2 in the operational range of GINGERINO, our Ring Laser Gyroscope.\\ In addition to fast frequency estimation, we introduce an automated classification framework to identify physical disturbances in the signal, such as laser instabilities and seismic events, achieving accuracy rates between 99\% and 100\% on independent test datasets for the seismic class. These results mark a step forward in integrating artificial intelligence into signal analysis for geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Hybrid RANS-LES and WALE Formulations for Wake and Resistance Prediction of the BB2 Submarine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Submarine hydrodynamics presents unique challenges in accurately predicting flow separation, wake structure, and resistance due to complex geometry and turbulent behaviour at high Reynolds (Re) numbers. Traditional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches are often limited in resolving unsteady flow structures and turbulence in the near and far regions. To address these limitations, hybrid RANS-LES models such as Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) offer improved performance in capturing near-wall vortical structures. The capturing of turbulent vortices and wake structures significantly contributes to conduct hydrodynamic noise analysis. Detailed resolution and understanding of these coherent structures help minimize hydroacoustic signatures, essential for submarines' stealth characteristics. Based on prior studies, Breuer et al. (2003) reported that RANS failed to capture unsteady vortex shedding, producing only steady results even in 3D simulations. In contrast, DES and LES successfully resolved asymmetric shedding across different grid resolutions. Spalart (2009) reported that DES is more effective than RANS or LES for high Re flows, although it suffers from challenges related to ambiguous grids and nonmonotonic grid refinement behaviour. Whereas Liang \&amp; Xue (2014) found that DES predicts tip vortex flow characteristics more accurately than RANS-SA and can capture complex 3D vortex structures. In addition, Guilmineau et al. (2018) demonstrated that the IDDES model accurately predicts recirculation bubbles and aligns more closely with experimental data for flow prediction. Long et al. (2021) confirmed the capability of DDES in simulating cavitating flows around hydrofoils and marine propellers. Lungu (2022) highlighted the efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid IDDES-SST model in DARPA submarine simulations. Zhang et al. (2023) also noted that URANS struggles with resolving small-scale turbulence structures, whereas IDDES is better suited for predicting complex phenomena such as ship air wake asymmetry. Nevertheless, capturing the unsteadiness and turbulence fluctuations scales is extremely challenging because the cell size requirements should suit each turbulence model employed. Thus, as a continuation of the prior work of Abidin et al. (2024), the unsteady simulation with high mesh resolution at $U_m=1.8235$ m/s and Re of $3.6\times 10^6$ to generate the asymmetrical wake dynamic and vortical structure. The current research expands the methodology by parameterizing the meshes and numerical scheme based on Taylor microscale refinement with respect to the characteristic length of (L, B and D) of submarine, particularly focusing on hybrid turbulence model and WALE to observe the ability to resolve turbulence in the wake region. The transient simulations were performed initially using wall-resolved mesh (76x10^6 cells) at y^+ &lt; 5 and then wall-modelled mesh (56x10^6 to 74x10^6 cells) at y^+ &gt; 30, which produced notably different and more detailed results (vortices and turbulence fluctuation) than previous steady-state RANS simulations without risking the accuracy of quantity of interest (global resistance).</description>

      <title>Mixed Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theoretic Decomposition of Kubo-Greenwood Conductivities in the Projector Augmented Wave Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state transitions at different incident photon energies.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Hydrodynamics at Exascale: A Trillion-Particle Leap in Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving the most fundamental questions in cosmology requires simulations that match the scale, fidelity, and physical complexity demanded by next-generation sky surveys. To achieve the realism needed for this critical scientific partnership, detailed gas dynamics, along with a host of astrophysical effects, must be treated self-consistently with gravity for end-to-end modeling of structure formation. As an important step on this roadmap, exascale computing enables simulations that span survey-scale volumes while incorporating key subgrid processes that shape complex cosmic structures. We present results from CRK-HACC, a cosmological hydrodynamics code built for the extreme scalability requirements set by modern cosmological surveys. Using separation-of-scale techniques, GPU-resident tree solvers, in situ analysis pipelines, and multi-tiered I/O, CRK-HACC executed Frontier-E: a four trillion particle full-sky simulation, over an order of magnitude larger than previous efforts. The run achieved 513.1 PFLOPs peak performance, processing 46.6 billion particles per second and writing more than 100 PB of data in just over one week of runtime.</description>

      <title>Consistent kinetic modeling of compressible flows with variable Prandtl numbers: Double-distribution quasi-equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consistent kinetic modeling and discretization strategy for compressible flows across all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios is developed using the quasi-equilibrium approach within two of the most widely used double-distribution frameworks. The methodology ensures accurate recovery of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, including all macroscopic moments and dissipation rates, through detailed hydrodynamic limit analysis and careful construction of equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium attractors. Discretization is performed using high-order velocity lattices with a static reference frame in a discrete velocity Boltzmann context to isolate key modeling aspects such as the necessary requirements on expansion and quadrature orders. The proposed models demonstrate high accuracy, numerical stability and Galilean invariance across a wide range of Mach numbers and temperature ratios. Separate tests for strict conservation and measurements of all dissipation rates confirm these insights for all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios. Simulations on a sensitive two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction excellently reproduce viscous Navier-Stokes-Fourier-level physics. The proposed models establish an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible flows with moderate supersonic speeds and discontinuities at arbitrary Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics and paving the way for future extensions to the lattice Boltzmann context, by application of correction terms, as well as high-Mach and hypersonic regimes, employing target-designed reference frames.</description>

      <title>Filtered Quantum Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate state preparation is a critical bottleneck in many quantum algorithms, particularly those for ground state energy estimation. Even in fault-tolerant quantum computing, preparing a quantum state with sufficient overlap to the desired eigenstate remains a major challenge. To address this, we develop a unified framework for filtered-state preparation that enhances the overlap of a given input state through spectral filtering. This framework encompasses the polynomial and trigonometric realizations of filters, allowing a transparent analysis of the trade-offs between overlap amplification and preparation cost. As examples, we introduce signal-processing-inspired filters, such as Gaussian filters and Krylov subspace-based filters, that adaptively suppress excited-state contributions using low-rank projections. Within this framework, we further develop a filtered variant of QPE (FQPE) that mitigates the unfavorable dependence on the initial overlap present in standard QPE. Numerical experiments on Fermi-Hubbard models show that FQPE reduces the total runtime by more than two orders of magnitude in the high-precision regime, with overlap amplification exceeding a factor of one hundred.</description>

      <title>Mixing of a binary passive particle system using smart active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled activity of active entities interacting with a passive environment can generate emergent system-level phenomena, positioning such systems as promising platforms for potential downstream applications in targeted drug delivery, adaptive and reconfigurable materials, microfluidic transport and related fields. The present work aims to realise an optimal mixing of two segregated species of passive particles by introducing a small fraction of active particles (2% by composition) with adaptive and intelligent behaviour, directed by a trained Artificial Neural Network-based agent. While conventional run-and-tumble particles can induce mixing in the system, the smart active particles demonstrate superior performance, achieving faster and more efficient mixing. Interestingly, an optimal mixing strategy doesn't involve a uniform dispersion of active particles in the domain, but rather limiting their motion to an eccentrically placed zone of activity, inducing a global rotational motion of the passive particles about the system centre. A transition in the directionality of the passive particles' motion is observed along the radius towards the centre, likening the active particles' motion to an ellipse-shaped void with a defined surface speed. Situated at the intersection of active matter and machine learning, this work highlights the potential of integrating adaptive learning frameworks into traditional active matter models.</description>

Abstract: Few-body physics explores quantum systems of a small number of particles, bridging the gap between single-particle and many-body regimes. To provide an accessible tool for such studies, we present FewBodyToolkit.jl, a Julia package for quantum few-body simulations. The package supports general two- and three-body systems in various spatial dimensions with arbitrary pair-interactions, and allows to calculate bound and resonant states. The implementation is based on the well-established Gaussian expansion method and we illustrate the package's capabilities through benchmarks and research examples. The package comes with documentation and examples, making it useful for research, teaching, benchmarking, and method development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</description>

      <title>Investigating into mechanisms of high temperature strength of refractory high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The yield strength plateau of two BCC refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) - MoNbTaVW and MoNbTaW was examined through hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. By analyzing atomic diffusivities derived from vacancy formation and migration energies around the edge dislocation cores, the number of critical atomic swaps were calculated at different temperatures. Using hybrid MC/MD simulations of these critical swaps, we demonstrate that above 1400K, the stress required to move the dislocations gets saturated, indicating the effect of Dynamic Strain Ageing (DSA) via cross core motion. Further simulations on random solid solutions (0 MC swaps) revealed a similar plateau effect at the intermediate temperatures. This was attributed to the additional athermal stress arising from lattice distortions due to solid solution strengthening. Our findings suggest that the yield strength plateau results from an interplay between the DSA-driven diffusion process and athermal stress. Specifically, the plateau emerges from DSA mechanisms in the presence of atomic diffusion, whereas in the absence of diffusion, it is governed by athermal statistical lattice distortions. This dual mechanism framework provides a comprehensive explanation for the experimentally observed Yield strength behavior in RHEAs at intermediate temperatures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a higher-order boundary condition for atomistic simulations of dislocations that address the slow convergence of standard supercell methods. The method is based on a multipole expansion of the equilibrium displacement, combining continuum predictor solutions with discrete moment corrections. The continuum predictors are computed by solving a hierarchy of singular elliptic PDEs via a Galerkin spectral method, while moment coefficients are evaluated from force-moment identities with controlled approximation error. A key feature is the coupling between accurate continuum predictors and moment evaluations, enabling the construction of systematically improvable high-order boundary conditions. We thus design novel algorithms, and numerical results for screw and edge dislocations confirm the predicted convergence rates in geometry and energy norms, with reduced finite-size effects and moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision ab initio tensor network state methods adapted for NVIDIA Blackwell technology via emulated FP64 arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report cutting-edge performance results via mixed-precision spin adapted ab initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) electronic structure calculations utilizing the Ozaki scheme for emulating FP64 arithmetic through the use of fixed-point compute resources. By approximating the underlying matrix and tensor algebra with operations on a modest number of fixed-point representatives (``slices''), we demonstrate on smaller benchmark systems and for the active compounds of the FeMoco and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)] and 63 electrons in 58 orbitals [CAS(63, 58)], respectively, that the chemical accuracy can be reached with mixed-precision arithmetic. We also show that, due to its variational nature, DMRG provides an ideal tool to benchmark accuracy domains, as well as the performance of new hardware developments and related numerical libraries. Detailed numerical error analysis and performance assessment are also presented for subcomponents of the DMRG algebra by systematically interpolating between double- and pseudo-half-precision. Our analyis represents the first quantum chemistry evaluation of FP64 emulation for correlated calculations capable of achieving chemical accuracy and emulation based on fixed-point arithmetic, and it paves the way for the utilization of state-of-the-art Blackwell technology in tree-like tensor network state electronic structure calculations, opening new research directions in materials sciences and beyond.</description>

      <title>Field-Theoretic Simulation of Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics for Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formulation of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for interacting particles is a crucial step in the theoretical description of liquids. The microscopic mappings proposed decades ago by Dean and Kawasaki have played a central role in the analytical treatment of such problems. However, the singular mathematical nature of the density distributions used in these derivations raises concerns about the validity and practical utility of the resulting stochastic partial differential equations, particularly for direct numerical simulations. Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation. Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.</description>

      <title>Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>HierarchicalEOM.jl: An efficient Julia framework for hierarchical equations of motion in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach can describe the reduced dynamics of a system simultaneously coupled to multiple bosonic and fermionic environments. The complexity of exactly describing the system-environment interaction with the HEOM method usually results in time-consuming calculations and a large memory cost. Here, we introduce an open-source software package called HierarchicalEOM$.$jl: a Julia framework integrating the HEOM approach. HierarchicalEOM$.$jl features a collection of methods to compute bosonic and fermionic spectra, stationary states, and the full dynamics in the extended space of all auxiliary density operators (ADOs). The required handling of the ADOs multi-indexes is achieved through a user-friendly interface. We exemplify the functionalities of the package by analyzing a single impurity Anderson model, and an ultra-strongly coupled charge-cavity system interacting with bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. HierarchicalEOM$.$jl achieves a significant speedup with respect to the corresponding method in the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), upon which this package is founded.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large recirculation cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two recirculation cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. Though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretization method for simulating the radiative transport equation. However, the ray effect is a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests that exhibit the ray effect, we observe low regularity in the velocity variable of the solution. To address this issue, we propose a Random Ordinate Method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared to other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) For benchmark tests that exhibit ray effect, the computational cost is lower than that of the DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing DOM-based code; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. A formal analysis is presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias. Numerical tests demonstrate the reduction in computational cost compared to DOM, as well as its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

Abstract: Accurately capturing the complex interaction between CO2 and water in porous media at the pore scale is essential for various geoscience applications, including carbon capture and storage (CCS). We introduce a comprehensive dataset generated from high-fidelity numerical simulations to capture the intricate interaction between CO2 and water at the pore scale. The dataset consists of 624 2D samples, each of size 512x512 with a resolution of 35 {\mu}m, covering 100 time steps under a constant CO2 injection rate. It includes various levels of heterogeneity, represented by different grain sizes with random variation in spacing, offering a robust testbed for developing predictive models. This dataset provides high-resolution temporal and spatial information crucial for benchmarking machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of semantic information in deep representations of text and images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.</description>

      <title>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</description>
