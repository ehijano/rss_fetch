      <title>Cross-correlating the patchy screening and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects as a new probe of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) and patchy screening effect are two complementary cosmic microwave background (CMB) probes of the reionization era. The kSZ effect is a relatively strong signal, but is difficult to disentangle from other sources of temperature anisotropy, whereas patchy screening is weaker but can be reconstructed using the cleaner polarization channel. Here, we explore the potential of using upcoming CMB surveys to correlate a reconstructed map of patchy screening with (the square of) the kSZ map, and what a detection of this cross-correlation would mean for reionization science. To do this, we use simulations and theory to quantify the contributions to this signal from different redshifts. We then use the expected survey properties for CMB-S4 and CMB-HD to make detection forecasts before exploring how the signal depends on reionization parameters. We forecast that CMB-S4 will obtain a hint of this signal at up to 1.8$\sigma$ and CMB-HD will detect it at up to 14$\sigma$. We find that this signal contains unique information about the timing and morphology of reionization, particularly sensitivity to the first half of reionization and to the bispectrum of the ionized gas distribution.</description>

      <title>The uncommon intracluster medium features of the first massive clusters selected independently of their baryon content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our current knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of galaxy clusters comes primarily from detailed studies of clusters selected by their minority components: hot baryons. Most of these studies select the clusters using the component that is being investigated, the intracluster medium (ICM), making the sample choice prone to selection effects. Weak-gravitational lensing allows us to select clusters by the total mass component and, being independent of the type of matter, makes the sample choice unbiased with respect to the baryon content. In this paper, we study four galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift ($0.25&lt;z&lt;0.61$), selected from the weak-lensing survey of Miyazaki et al. (2018). We derive core-excised X-ray luminosities, richness-based masses, Compton parameters, and profiles of mass, pressure and electron densities. These quantities are derived from shear data, Compton maps, and our own X-ray and SZ follow-up. When compared to ICM-selected clusters of the same mass, in the range $2$ to $5 \ 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$, our small sample of four clusters is expected to have on average 0.2 rare ($&gt;2\sigma$) features, while we observed on average two rare features in each one of the seven explored properties: richness, core-excised luminosity, Compton parameter, pressure and electron pressure profiles, and central values of them. The abundance of rare and unique features in such a small sample indicates a fundamental bias in our knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of clusters when derived from ICM-selected samples.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints using the Void Size Function Data from BOSS DR16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the void size function (VSF) from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR16) and perform the cosmological constraints. The BOSS DR16 galaxy sample is selected in the redshift range from $z = 0.2$ to 0.8, considering the selection criteria based on galaxy number density. We identify non-spherical voids from this galaxy catalog using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm without assuming any void shape. We select the void samples based on the void ellipticity, and derive the VSFs in two redshift bins, i.e. $z=0.2-0.5$ and $0.5-0.8$. The VSF model we use is based on the excursion-set theory, including the void linear underdensity threshold $\delta_{\rm v}$ and the redshift space distortion (RSD) parameter $\beta$. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is applied to perform the joint constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that the VSF measurement from BOSS DR16 gives $w = -1.214_{-0.375}^{+0.293}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.280_{-0.047}^{+0.056}$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.874_{-0.210}^{+0.203}$, which can be a good complementary probe to galaxy clustering measurements. Our method demonstrates the potential of using the VSF to study cosmological models, and it can provide a reference for future VSF analysis in the upcoming galaxy spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Using the Kaniadakis horizon entropy in the presence of neutrinos to alleviate the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $H_{0}$ tension stands as a prominent challenge in cosmology, serving as a primary driver for exploring alternative models of dark energy. Another tension arises from measurements of the $ S_{8} $ parameter, which is characterize the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe. In this study, we address the alleviation of both the Hubble tension and $ S_{8} $ tension by incorporating Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We investigate two scenarios to explore the impact of this entropy on cosmological parameters. In the first scenario, utilizing modified Friedmann equations through Kaniadakis entropy, we estimate the values of $H_{0}$ and $ S_{8} $. In the subsequent scenario, we introduce the neutrino term and assess its effect on mitigating the Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Our findings reveal that when considering the first scenario, the results closely align with Planck's 2018 outcomes for Hubble and $ S_{8} $ tensions. Moreover, with the inclusion of neutrinos, these tensions are alleviated to approximately 2$\sigma$, and the $ S_{8} $ value is in full agreement with the results from the KiDS and DES survey. Furthermore, we impose a constraint on the parameter $K$ in each scenario. Our analysis yields $K = 0.12\pm 0.41$ for Kaniadakis entropy without neutrinos and $K = 0.39\pm 0.4$ for the combined dataset considering Kaniadakis entropy in the presence of neutrinos. We demonstrate that the value of K may be affected by neutrino mass, which can cause energy transfer between different parts of the universe and alter the Hubble parameter value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of weak gravitational lensing and its current applications in cosmology. We begin by introducing the fundamental concepts of gravitational lensing and derive the key equations for the deflection angle, lensing potential, convergence, and shear. We explore how weak lensing can be used as a cosmological probe, discussing cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and their combination with galaxy clustering in the 3$\times$2pt analysis. The chapter covers the theoretical framework for modeling lensing observables, shear estimation techniques, and major systematic effects such as intrinsic alignments and baryonic feedback. We review the current results of weak lensing cosmology from major surveys and outline prospects for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Cosmic quenching and scaling laws for the evolution of supermassive black holes and host galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations suggest an SMBH-host coevolution. We consider the mass and energy flow in a bulge suffused by gases of varying temperatures. By assuming the rate of energy flow independent of the distance from the bulge center and the local virial equilibrium for permeated gases, a key parameter $\varepsilon_b$ was identified that quantifies the rate of mass and energy flow in gases and the efficiency of gas cooling and thus regulates the coevolution of SMBHs and hosts. Using Illustris simulations, we found $\varepsilon_b\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. A higher $\varepsilon_b$ in the early Universe means a more efficient gas cooling that allows initial rapid growth of SMBHs and hosts. This simple theory, characterized by $\varepsilon_b$, provides the dominant mean cosmic evolution of SMBHs and hosts. All other transient phenomena may only contribute to the dispersion around mean evolution. Relevant scaling laws involving $\varepsilon_b$ were identified. For host galaxies, the mass-size relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{2/3}r_b^{5/3}G^{-1}$, dispersion-size relation $\sigma_b^2\propto(\varepsilon_b r_b)^{2/3}\propto (1+z)$, or the mass-dispersion relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{-1}G^{-1}\sigma_b^5$ were identified, where size $r_b\propto (1+z)^{-1}$. For SMBHs, three evolution phases were found involving an initial rapid growth stage with a rising luminosity $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/5}$, a transition stage with a declining $L_B\propto \varepsilon_b^2 M_{BH} \propto (1+z)^5$, and a dormant stage with $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/3}$. Results suggest a rapid initial super-Eddington growth with a new redshift-dependent luminosity limit $L_X\propto\varepsilon_b^{4/5}M_{BH}^{4/5}G^{-1/5}c$, in contrast to the Eddington limit. Analytical solutions are formulated for the BH and AGN mass functions and AGN duty cycle and predict a slope of -1/5 for the faint-end luminosity function.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance: Probing a New Regime of Neutrino Self-Interactions with Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass much smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 I: X-ray exploration of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.57^{+0.37}_{-0.38}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.86^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

      <title>Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Light Compact Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussianities generated by light axions, or compact scalar fields, during inflation. To correctly calculate their impact on primordial statistics, we will argue that it is necessary to account for the periodicity, or gauge symmetry, of the compact scalars. We illustrate this point by comparing the predictions for the squeezed kinematic limit of the primordial bispectrum generated by two cases: a non-compact scalar $\sigma$ and a compact scalar $\varphi$. We demonstrate that while a light non-compact scalar predicts a bispectrum of the so-called local shape, the light compact scalar predicts a qualitatively different shape characterised by the ratio of the Hubble scale to its field-space circumference. In doing so, we show that ignoring the gauge symmetry of the compact scalar during inflation leads to spurious infrared enhancements which are softened by working with appropriate gauge-invariant operators. In addition, we connect our results for the primordial bispectrum with late-time cosmological observables and show that it is possible to measure the decay constant of the compact scalar using galaxy clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of dark matter halo merger trees and the consequences for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy formation and evolution models, such as semi-analytic models, are powerful theoretical tools for predicting how galaxies evolve across cosmic time. These models follow the evolution of galaxies based on the halo assembly histories inferred from large $N$-body cosmological simulations. This process requires codes to identify halos ("halo finder") and to track their time evolution ("tree builder"). While these codes generally perform well, they encounter numerical issues when handling dense environments. In this paper, we present how relevant these issues are in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We characterize two major numerical artefacts in halo assembly histories: (i) the non-physical swapping of large amounts of mass between subhalos, and (ii) the sudden formation of already massive subhalos at late cosmic times. We quantify these artefacts for different combinations of halo finder (SUBFIND, VELOCIRAPTOR, HBT+HERONS) and tree builder codes (D-TRESS+DHALO, TREEFROG, HBT+HERONS), finding that in general more than $50\%$ ($80\%$) of the more massive subhalos with $&gt;10^{3}$ ($&gt;10^{4}$) particles at $z=0$ inherit them in most cases. However, HBT+HERONS, which explicitly incorporates temporal information, effectively reduces the occurrence of these artefacts to $5\%$ ($10\%$). We then use the semi-analytic models SHARK and GALFORM to explore how these artefacts impact galaxy formation predictions. We demonstrate that the issues above lead to non-physical predictions in galaxies hosted by affected halos, particularly in SHARK where the modelling of baryons relies on subhalo information. Finally, we propose and implement fixes for the numerical artefacts at the semi-analytic model level, and use SHARK to show the improvements, especially at the high-mass end, after applying them.</description>

      <title>Mapping reionization bubbles in the JWST era II: inferring the position and characteristic size of individual bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is discovering an increasing number of galaxies well into the early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Many of these galaxies are clustered with strong Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission, motivating the presence of surrounding cosmic HII regions that would facilitate Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detecting these HII "bubbles" would allow us to connect their growth to the properties of the galaxies inside them. Here we develop a new forward-modeling framework to estimate the local HII region size and location from Ly$\alpha$ spectra of galaxy groups in the early stages of the EoR. Our model takes advantage of the complementary information provided by neighboring sightlines through the IGM. Our forward models sample the main sources of uncertainty, including: (i) the global neutral fraction; (ii) EoR morphology; (iii) emergent Ly$\alpha$ emission; and (iv) NIRSpec instrument noise. Depending on the availability of complementary nebular lines, $\sim$ 0.006 $\unicode{x2013}$ 0.01 galaxies per cMpc$^3$, are required to be $\gtrsim$95\% confident that the HII bubble location and size recovered by our method is accurate to within $\sim$ 1 comoving Mpc. This corresponds roughly to tens of galaxies at $z\sim7\unicode{x2013}8$ in $\sim$2x2 tiled pointing with JWST NIRSpec. Such a sample is achievable with a targeted survey with completeness down to $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm min}\lesssim$ -19 $\unicode{x2013}$ -17, depending on the over-density of the field. We test our method on 3D EoR simulations as well as misspecified equivalent width distributions, in both cases accurately recovering the HII region surrounding targeted galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>The effect of environment on the mass assembly history of the Milky Way and M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mass growth histories of the halos of Milky Way and M31 analogues formed in constrained cosmological simulations of the Local Group. These simulations constitute a fair and representative set of $\Lambda$CDM realisations conditioned on properties of the main Local Group galaxies, such as their masses, relative separation, dynamics and environment. Comparing with isolated analogues extracted from the TNG dark-matter-only simulations, we find that while our M31 halos have a comparable mass growth history to their isolated counterparts, our Milky Ways typically form earlier and their growth is suppressed at late times. Mass growth associated to major and minor mergers is also biased early for the Milky Way in comparison to M31, with most accretion occurring 1 - 4 Gyr after the Big Bang, and a relatively quiescent history at later times. 32% of our Milky Ways experienced a Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES)-like merger, while 13% host an LMC-like object at the present day, with 5% having both. In one case, an SMC- and a Sagittarius-analogue are also present, showing that the most important mergers of the Milky Way in its Local Group environment can be reproduced in $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the material that makes up the Milky Way and M31 halos at the present day first collapsed onto a plane roughly aligned with the Local Sheet and Supergalactic plane; after $z \sim 2$, accretion occurred mostly within this plane, with the tidal effects of the heavier companion, M31, significantly impacting the late growth history of the Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of Chern-Simons gravity, a theory that dynamically violates parity, we analyze the power spectrum of gravitational waves in light of the damping effect due to the free streaming relativistic neutrinos and dark fermions. The power spectrum is expressed terms of right- and left-handed polarizations, and the evolution of the gravitational waves is studied numerically. Birefringence is explicitly shown in the power spectrum, though the difference in the amplitudes is small. Specific features of peaks and dips appear gravitational wave power spectrum mirroring chiral gravitational wave mediated parametric resonance during reheating. Our result represents a useful tool to test Chern-Simons gravity and enables to constrain mechanisms of inflation and reheating related to this theory. We predict a falsifiable pattern of observable peaks and dips in the chiral independent gravitational power spectrum, eventually observable in next space-borne gravitational interferometers, including LISA, Taiji and Tianqin.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic data sets are used in cosmology to test analysis procedures, to verify that systematic errors are well understood and to demonstrate that measurements are unbiased. In this work we describe the methods used to generate synthetic datasets of Lyman-$\alpha$ quasar spectra aimed for studies with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In particular, we focus on demonstrating that our simulations reproduces important features of real samples, making them suitable to test the analysis methods to be used in DESI and to place limits on systematic effects on measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We present a set of mocks that reproduce the statistical properties of the DESI early data set with good agreement. Additionally, we use full survey synthetic data to forecast the BAO scale constraining power with DESI.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dark siren cosmology systematics from galaxy weighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of GW170817 and the measurement of its redshift from the associated electromagnetic counterpart provided the first gravitational wave determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), demonstrating the potential power of standard-siren cosmology. In contrast to this bright siren approach, the dark siren approach can be utilized for gravitational-wave sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: one considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, weighting them by physically-motivated properties (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass) could improve convergence. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of $H_0$. We find that incorrect weighting schemes can lead to significant biases due to two effects: the assumption of an incorrect galaxy redshift distribution, and preferentially weighting incorrect host galaxies during the inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the number of galaxies along each line of sight, the measurement uncertainty in the gravitational-wave luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. We show that the bias may be overcome from improved localization constraints in future GW detectors, a strategic choice of priors or weighting prescription, and by restricting the analysis to a subset of high-SNR events. We propose the use of hierarchical inference as a diagnostic of incorrectly-weighted prescriptions. Such approaches can simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and the values of the cosmological parameters, thereby mitigating the bias in dark siren cosmology due to incorrect host-galaxy weighting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism for analyzing galaxy clustering on the lightcone with the 2-point correlation in the Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) formalism, which is a natural choice to account for all wide-angle and relativistic (GR) effects. We extend previous studies by including all projection and GR effects, developing an efficient numerical implementation that avoids the use of the Limber approximation, includes multi-bins correlations and a full non-diagonal covariance.
  Using this formalism, we investigate the impact of neglecting GR corrections, and in particular how much this could bias measurements of the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL}$.
  Our results show that not including relativistic projection terms can systematically and non-negligibly bias estimates of $f_\mathrm{NL}$. The exact results depend on survey specifications and galaxy population properties, but we stress that a bias will generally be present.
  Finally, we develop a novel prescription for cross-bin correlations that allow to search for a clean signal of relativistic corrections, and show that this requires the use of the 3D full-sky formalism.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship of dark matter haloes in state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and their dark-matter-only counterparts. By combining the IllustrisTNG suite and the novel MillenniumTNG simulation, our analysis encompasses a wide range of box size ($50 - 740 \: \rm cMpc$) and mass resolution ($8.5 \times 10^4 - 3.1 \times 10^7 \: \rm M_{\odot}$ per baryonic mass element). This enables us to study the impact of baryons on the concentration-mass relationship in the redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;7$ over an unprecedented halo mass range, extending from dwarf galaxies to superclusters ($\sim 10^{9.5}-10^{15.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the presence of baryons increases the steepness of the concentration-mass relationship at higher redshift, and demonstrate that this is driven by adiabatic contraction of the profile, due to gas accretion at early times, which promotes star formation in the inner regions of haloes. At lower redshift, when the effects of feedback start to become important, baryons decrease the concentration of haloes below the mass scale $\sim 10^{11.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$. Through a rigorous information criterion test, we show that broken power-law models accurately represent the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship, and of the relative difference in the total mass of haloes induced by the presence of baryons. We provide the best-fit parameters of our empirical formulae, enabling their application to models that mimic baryonic effects in dark-matter-only simulations over six decades in halo mass in the redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;7$.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free uncertainty quantification for inverse problems: application to weak lensing mass mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inverse problems, distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to obtain error bars with coverage guarantees that are independent of any prior assumptions about the data distribution. In the context of mass mapping, uncertainties could lead to errors that affects our understanding of the underlying mass distribution, or could propagate to cosmological parameter estimation, thereby impacting the precision and reliability of cosmological models. Current surveys, such as Euclid or Rubin, will provide new weak lensing datasets of very high quality. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in mass maps is therefore critical to perform reliable cosmological parameter inference. In this paper, we extend the conformalized quantile regression (CQR) algorithm, initially proposed for scalar regression, to inverse problems. We compare our approach with another distribution-free approach based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS). Both methods are based on a calibration dataset, and offer finite-sample coverage guarantees that are independent of the data distribution. Furthermore, they are applicable to any mass mapping method, including blackbox predictors. In our experiments, we apply UQ on three mass-mapping method: the Kaiser-Squires inversion, iterative Wiener filtering, and the MCALens algorithm. Our experiments reveal that RCPS tends to produce overconservative confidence bounds with small calibration sets, whereas CQR is designed to avoid this issue. Although the expected miscoverage rate is guaranteed to stay below a user-prescribed threshold regardless of the mass mapping method, selecting an appropriate reconstruction algorithm remains crucial for obtaining accurate estimates, especially around peak-like structures, which are particularly important for inferring cosmological parameters. Additionally, the choice of mass mapping method influences the size of the error bars.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological parameter fitting remains crucial, especially with the abundance of available data. While many parameters have been tightly constrained, discrepancies-most notably the Hubble tension-persist between measurements obtained from different observational datasets. In this paper, we re-examine the Pantheon supernova dataset to explore deviations in the distribution of distance modulus residuals from the Gaussian distribution, which is typically the underlying assumption. We do this analysis for the concordant cosmological constant model and for a variety of dynamical dark energy models. It has been shown earlier that the residuals in this dataset are better fit to a logistic distribution. We compare the residual distributions assuming both Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods on the complete dataset, as well as various subsets of the data. The results, validated through various statistical tests, demonstrate that the Logistic likelihood provides a better fit for the full dataset and lower redshift bins, while higher redshift bins fit Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods similarly. Furthermore, the findings indicate a preference for a cosmological constant model. However analysing individual surveys within the Pantheon dataset reveals inconsistencies among subsets. The level of agreement between surveys varies depending upon the underlying likelihood function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of a minimal Scotogenic model with two additional scalar doublets and a single heavy Majorana fermion to explain neutrino masses, dark matter, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this minimal setup, Leptogenesis is purely flavored, and a second Majorana neutrino is not necessary because the Yukawa couplings of the extra doublets yield the necessary $CP$-odd phases. The mechanism we employ can also be applied to a wide range of scenarios with at least one singlet and two gauge multiplets. Despite stringent limits from the dark matter abundance, direct detection experiments, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, we find a parametric region consistent with all bounds which could resolve the above shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics. Methodically, we improve on the calculation of correlations between the mixing scalar fields given their finite width. We also present an argument to justify the kinetic equilibrium approximation for out-of-equilibrium distribution functions often used in calculations of Baryogenesis and Leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forty years ago Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe. We discuss the impact of an instability in the hadronic phase separating a low density, positive-strange-charge phase from a high-density phase with a negative strange charge. This second phase can rapidly stabilize by forming color-superconducting gaps. The strangelets then undergo partial evaporation. In this way, we obtain distributions of their sizes in agreement with the observational constraints and we discuss the many astrophysical and cosmological implications of these objects. Finally, we examine the most promising techniques to detect this type of strangelets. We also show that strangelets can exist with masses $\lesssim10^{17} \mathrm g$, while primordial black holes are ruled out in that mass range, allowing us to distinguish between these two dark matter candidates.</description>

Abstract: Theories formulated in the arena of teleparallel geometries are generically plagued by ghost-like instabilities or other pathologies that are ultimately caused by the breaking of some symmetries. In this work, we construct a class of ghost-free theories based on a symmetry under Transverse Diffeomorphisms that is naturally realised in symmetric teleparallelism. We explicitly show their equivalence to a family of theories with an extra scalar field plus a global degree of freedom and how Horndeski theories and healthy couplings to matter fields can be readily accommodated.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of WIMP bounds on the velocity distribution in the limit of a massless mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the sensitivity of the bounds on the spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron interaction couplings $\alpha_{SI, SD}^{p,n}$ on the WIMP velocity distribution for a massless mediator in the propagator by combining direct detection and the neutrino signal from WIMP annihilation in the Sun (fixing the annihilation channel to $b\bar{b}$). We update the bounds in the Standard Halo Model (SHM) and using the halo-independent single-stream method. In the case of a massless mediator the SHM capture rate in the Sun diverges and is regularized by removing the contribution of WIMPs locked into orbits that extend beyond the Sun-Jupiter distance. We discuss the dependence of the SHM bounds on the Jupiter cut showing that it can be sizeable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and a WIMP mass $m_\chi$ exceeding 1 TeV. Our updated SHM bounds show an improvement between about two and three orders of magnitude compared to the previous ones in the literature. Our halo-independent analysis shows that, with the exception of $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ at large $m_\chi$, the relaxation of the bounds compared to the SHM is of the same order of that for contact interactions, i.e. relatively moderate in the low and high WIMP mass regimes and as large as a few $\times\sim 10^2$ for $m_\chi\simeq$ 20 GeV. On the other hand, the exact determination of the relaxation of the bound becomes not reliable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and $m_\chi\gtrsim$ 1 TeV due to the sensitivity of the SHM capture rate in the Sun to the details of the Maxwellian velocity distribution at low incoming WIMP speeds. The halo-independent bounds do not depend on the Jupiter cut needed to regularize the calculation of the capture rate.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a unique quasar-dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) system at $z = 5.63$, consisting of the bright quasar J1133+1603 ($M_{\rm UV} = -27.42$) and its compact, dust-obscured companion, J1133c. ALMA observations reveal a prominent [C II] bridge connecting the quasar and DSFG, indicating ongoing interaction at a projected separation of 1.8 arcsec ($\sim$10 proper kpc). J1133c exhibits unusually bright and broad [C II] emission ($L_{\rm [CII]} &gt; 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, FWHM $&gt; 500$ km s$^{-1}$), with a [C II] luminosity five times that of the quasar, suggesting intense star formation or potential AGN activity. The inferred star formation rate from [C II] is approximately $10^3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The remarkable properties of this pair strongly suggest that galaxy interactions may simultaneously trigger both starburst and quasar activity, driving rapid evolution in the early universe.</description>
