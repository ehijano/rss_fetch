      <title>Scalable Signed Exponential Random Graph Models under Local Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional network analysis focuses on binary edges, while real-world relationships are more nuanced, encompassing cooperation, neutrality, and conflict. The rise of negative edges in social media discussions spurred interest in analyzing signed interactions, especially in polarized debates. However, the vast data generated by digital networks presents challenges for traditional methods like Stochastic Block Models (SBM) and Exponential Family Random Graph Models (ERGM), particularly due to the homogeneity assumption and global dependence, which become increasingly unrealistic as network size grows. To address this, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of SBM and ERGM while mitigating their weaknesses by incorporating local dependence based on non-overlapping blocks. Our approach involves a two-step process: first, decomposing the network into sub-networks using SBM approximation, and then estimating parameters using ERGM methods. We validate our method on large synthetic networks and apply it to a signed Wikipedia network of thousands of editors. Through the use of local dependence, we find patterns consistent with structural balance theory.</description>

      <title>Beyond Connectivity: Higher-Order Network Framework for Capturing Memory-Driven Mobility Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting mobility dynamics in transportation networks is critical for infrastructure planning, resilience analysis, and traffic management. Traditional graph-based models typically assume memoryless movement, limiting their ability to capture sequential dependencies inherent in real-world mobility patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel higher-order network framework for modeling memory-dependent dynamics in transportation systems. By extending classical graph representations through higher-order Markov chains and de Bruijn graph structures, our framework encodes the spatial and temporal ordering of traversed paths, enabling the analysis of structurally and functionally critical components with improved fidelity. We generalize key network analytics, including betweenness centrality, PageRank, and next-step prediction, to this higher-order setting and validate our approach on the Sioux Falls transportation network using agent-based trajectory data generated with MATSim. Experimental results demonstrate that higher-order models outperform first-order baselines across multiple tasks, with the third-order model achieving an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and model complexity. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating memory effects into network-based transportation analysis and offer a scalable, data-driven methodology for capturing complex mobility behaviors in infrastructure systems.</description>

      <title>Conspiracy to Commit: Information Pollution, Artificial Intelligence, and Real-World Hate Crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is demand for conspiracy theories online linked to real-world hate crimes? By analyzing online search trends for 36 racially and politically-charged conspiracy theories in Michigan (2015-2019), we employ a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to predict hate crime occurrences offline. A subset of theories including the Rothschilds family, Q-Anon, and The Great Replacement improves prediction accuracy, with effects emerging two to three weeks after fluctuations in searches. However, most theories showed no clear connection to offline hate crimes. Aligning with neutralization and differential association theories, our findings provide a partial empirical link between specific racially charged conspiracy theories and real-world violence. Just as well, this study underscores the potential for machine learning to be used in identifying harmful online patterns and advancing social science research.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Adaptive Estimation of Local Triadic Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing graph properties is fundamental to the analysis and to our understanding of real-world networked systems. The local clustering coefficient, and the more recently introduced, local closure coefficient, capture powerful properties that are essential in a large number of applications, ranging from graph embeddings to graph partitioning. Such coefficients capture the local density of the neighborhood of each node, considering incident triadic structures and paths of length two. For this reason, we refer to these coefficients collectively as local triadic coefficients.
  In this work, we consider the novel problem of computing efficiently the average of local triadic coefficients, over a given partition of the nodes of the input graph into a set of disjoint buckets. The average local triadic coefficients of the nodes in each bucket provide a better insight into the interplay of graph structure and the properties of the nodes associated to each bucket. Unfortunately, exact computation, which requires listing all triangles in a graph, is infeasible for large networks. Hence, we focus on obtaining highly-accurate probabilistic estimates.
  We develop Triad, an adaptive algorithm based on sampling, which can be used to estimate the average local triadic coefficients for a partition of the nodes into buckets. Triad is based on a new class of unbiased estimators, and non-trivial bounds on its sample complexity, enabling the efficient computation of highly accurate estimates. Finally, we show how Triad can be efficiently used in practice on large networks, and we present a case study showing that average local triadic coefficients can capture high-order patterns over collaboration networks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of complex contagions is shaped by a trade-off between reach and reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does social network structure amplify or stifle behavior diffusion? Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5% margin in only 22% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions. This pattern reflects a fundamental tradeoff: random ties enhance reach, while clustered ties enhance social reinforcement.</description>

      <title>Random walk based snapshot clustering for detecting community dynamics in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk-based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows us to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting or merging of communities or their births and deaths. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>When Dialects Collide: How Socioeconomic Mixing Affects Language Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The socioeconomic background of people and how they use standard forms of language are not independent, as demonstrated in various sociolinguistic studies. However, the extent to which these correlations may be influenced by the mixing of people from different socioeconomic classes remains relatively unexplored from a quantitative perspective. In this work we leverage geotagged tweets and transferable computational methods to map deviations from standard English on a large scale, in seven thousand administrative areas of England and Wales. We combine these data with high-resolution income maps to assign a proxy socioeconomic indicator to home-located users. Strikingly, across eight metropolitan areas we find a consistent pattern suggesting that the more different socioeconomic classes mix, the less interdependent the frequency of their departures from standard grammar and their income become. Further, we propose an agent-based model of linguistic variety adoption that sheds light on the mechanisms that produce the observations seen in the data.</description>
