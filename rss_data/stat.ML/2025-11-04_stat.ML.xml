      <title>Gradient Boosted Mixed Models: Flexible Joint Estimation of Mean and Variance Components for Clustered Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear mixed models are widely used for clustered data, but their reliance on parametric forms limits flexibility in complex and high-dimensional settings. In contrast, gradient boosting methods achieve high predictive accuracy through nonparametric estimation, but do not accommodate clustered data structures or provide uncertainty quantification.
  We introduce Gradient Boosted Mixed Models (GBMixed), a framework and algorithm that extends boosting to jointly estimate mean and variance components via likelihood-based gradients. In addition to nonparametric mean estimation, the method models both random effects and residual variances as potentially covariate-dependent functions using flexible base learners such as regression trees or splines, enabling nonparametric estimation while maintaining interpretability.
  Simulations and real-world applications demonstrate accurate recovery of variance components, calibrated prediction intervals, and improved predictive accuracy relative to standard linear mixed models and nonparametric methods. GBMixed provides heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification and introduces boosting for heterogeneous random effects. This enables covariate-dependent shrinkage for cluster-specific predictions to adapt between population and cluster-level data. Under standard causal assumptions, the framework enables estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects with reliable uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>A Streaming Sparse Cholesky Method for Derivative-Informed Gaussian Process Surrogates Within Digital Twin Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins are developed to model the behavior of a specific physical asset (or twin), and they can consist of high-fidelity physics-based models or surrogates. A highly accurate surrogate is often preferred over multi-physics models as they enable forecasting the physical twin future state in real-time. To adapt to a specific physical twin, the digital twin model must be updated using in-service data from that physical twin. Here, we extend Gaussian process (GP) models to include derivative data, for improved accuracy, with dynamic updating to ingest physical twin data during service. Including derivative data, however, comes at a prohibitive cost of increased covariance matrix dimension. We circumvent this issue by using a sparse GP approximation, for which we develop extensions to incorporate derivatives. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the derivative-enhanced sparse GP method produces improved models upon dynamic data additions. Lastly, we apply the developed algorithm within a DT framework to model fatigue crack growth in an aerospace vehicle.</description>

      <title>Accuracy estimation of neural networks by extreme value theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are able to approximate any continuous function on a compact set. However, it is not obvious how to quantify the error of the neural network, i.e., the remaining bias between the function and the neural network. Here, we propose the application of extreme value theory to quantify large values of the error, which are typically relevant in applications. The distribution of the error beyond some threshold is approximately generalized Pareto distributed. We provide a new estimator of the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution suitable to describe the error of neural networks. Numerical experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>SOCRATES: Simulation Optimization with Correlated Replicas and Adaptive Trajectory Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of simulation optimization (SO) encompasses various methods developed to optimize complex, expensive-to-sample stochastic systems. Established methods include, but are not limited to, ranking-and-selection for finite alternatives and surrogate-based methods for continuous domains, with broad applications in engineering and operations management. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for exploiting system structure and automating the strategic selection and composition of these established SO methods into a tailored optimization procedure. This work introduces SOCRATES (Simulation Optimization with Correlated Replicas and Adaptive Trajectory Evaluations), a novel two-stage procedure that leverages LLMs to automate the design of tailored SO algorithms. The first stage constructs an ensemble of digital replicas of the real system. An LLM is employed to implement causal discovery from a textual description of the system, generating a structural `skeleton' that guides the sample-efficient learning of the replicas. In the second stage, this replica ensemble is used as an inexpensive testbed to evaluate a set of baseline SO algorithms. An LLM then acts as a meta-optimizer, analyzing the performance trajectories of these algorithms to iteratively revise and compose a final, hybrid optimization schedule. This schedule is designed to be adaptive, with the ability to be updated during the final execution on the real system when the optimization performance deviates from expectations. By integrating LLM-driven reasoning with LLM-assisted trajectory-aware meta-optimization, SOCRATES creates an effective and sample-efficient solution for complex SO optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in the Orthogonal Complement Subspace for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for deploying deep learning models in open-world environments. Existing approaches, such as energy-based scoring and gradient-projection methods, typically rely on high-dimensional representations to separate in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. We introduce P-OCS (Perturbations in the Orthogonal Complement Subspace), a lightweight and theoretically grounded method that operates in the orthogonal complement of the principal subspace defined by ID features. P-OCS applies a single projected perturbation restricted to this complementary subspace, enhancing subtle ID-OOD distinctions while preserving the geometry of ID representations. We show that a one-step update is sufficient in the small-perturbation regime and provide convergence guarantees for the resulting detection score. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that P-OCS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection with negligible computational cost and without requiring model retraining, access to OOD data, or changes to model architecture.</description>

      <title>Binary perceptron computational gap -- a parametric fl RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) likely exhibits the so-called statistical-computational gap characterized with the appearance of two phase transitioning constraint density thresholds: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the \emph{satisfiability threshold} $\alpha_c$, below/above which ABP succeeds/fails to operate as a storage memory; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} \emph{algorithmic threshold} $\alpha_a$, below/above which one can/cannot efficiently determine ABP's weight so that it operates as a storage memory.
  We consider a particular parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) [85] and study its potential ABP's algorithmic implications. A remarkable structural parametric change is uncovered as one progresses through fl RDT lifting levels. On the first two levels, the so-called $\c$ sequence -- a key parametric fl RDT component -- is of the (natural) decreasing type. A change of such phenomenology on higher levels is then connected to the $\alpha_c$ -- $\alpha_a$ threshold change. Namely, on the second level concrete numerical values give for the critical constraint density $\alpha=\alpha_c\approx 0.8331$. While progressing through higher levels decreases this estimate, already on the fifth level we observe a satisfactory level of convergence and obtain $\alpha\approx 0.7764$. This allows to draw two striking parallels: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the obtained constraint density estimate is in a remarkable agrement with range $\alpha\in (0.77,0.78)$ of clustering defragmentation (believed to be responsible for failure of locally improving algorithms) [17,88]; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} the observed change of $\c$ sequence phenomenology closely matches the one of the negative Hopfield model for which the existence of efficient algorithms that closely approach similar type of threshold has been demonstrated recently [87].</description>

      <title>Generalized Guarantees for Variational Inference in the Presence of Even and Elliptical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend several recent results providing symmetry-based guarantees for variational inference (VI) with location-scale families. VI approximates a target density~$p$ by the best match $q^*$ in a family $Q$ of tractable distributions that in general does not contain $p$. It is known that VI can recover key properties of $p$, such as its mean and correlation matrix, when $p$ and $Q$ exhibit certain symmetries and $q^*$ is found by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. We extend these guarantees in two important directions. First, we provide symmetry-based guarantees for a broader family of divergences, highlighting the properties of variational objectives under which VI provably recovers the mean and correlation matrix. Second, we obtain further guarantees for VI when the target density $p$ exhibits even and elliptical symmetries in some but not all of its coordinates. These partial symmetries arise naturally in Bayesian hierarchical models, where the prior induces a challenging geometry but still possesses axes of symmetry. We illustrate these theoretical results in a number of experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Hyper Hawkes Processes: Interpretable Models of Marked Temporal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational marked temporal point process (MTPP) models, such as the Hawkes process, often use inexpressive model families in order to offer interpretable parameterizations of event data. On the other hand, neural MTPPs models forego this interpretability in favor of absolute predictive performance. In this work, we present a new family MTPP models: the hyper Hawkes process (HHP), which aims to be as flexible and performant as neural MTPPs, while retaining interpretable aspects. To achieve this, the HHP extends the classical Hawkes process to increase its expressivity by first expanding the dimension of the process into a latent space, and then introducing a hypernetwork to allow time- and data-dependent dynamics. These extensions define a highly performant MTPP family, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmark tasks and metrics. Furthermore, by retaining the linearity of the recurrence, albeit now piecewise and conditionally linear, the HHP also retains much of the structure of the original Hawkes process, which we exploit to create direct probes into how the model creates predictions. HHP models therefore offer both state-of-the-art predictions, while also providing an opportunity to ``open the box'' and inspect how predictions were generated.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Multimodal Medical Imaging: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging relies heavily on large, labeled datasets. But, unfortunately, they are not always easily accessible in clinical settings. Additionally, many practitioners often face various structural obstacles like limited data availability, fragmented data systems, and unbalanced datasets. These barriers often lead to the increased diagnostic uncertainty, underrepresentation of certain conditions, reduced model robustness, and biased diagnostic decisions. In response to these challenges, approaches such as transfer learning, meta-learning, and multimodal fusion have made great strides. However, they still need a solid theoretical justification for why they succeed or fail in situations where data is scarce. To address this gap, we propose a unified theoretical framework that characterizes learning and inference under low-resource medical imaging conditions. We first formalize the learning objective under few-shot conditions and compute sample complexity constraints to estimate the smallest quantity of data needed to achieve clinically reliable accuracy. Then based on ideas from PAC-learning and PAC-Bayesian theory, we explain how multimodal integration encourages generalization and quantifies uncertainty under sparse supervision. We further propose a formal metric for explanation stability, offering interpretability guarantees under low-data conditions. Taken together, the proposed framework establishes a principled foundation for constructing dependable, data-efficient diagnostic systems by jointly characterizing sample efficiency, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability in a unified theoretical setting.</description>

      <title>An Interdisciplinary and Cross-Task Review on Missing Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing data is a fundamental challenge in data science, significantly hindering analysis and decision-making across a wide range of disciplines, including healthcare, bioinformatics, social science, e-commerce, and industrial monitoring. Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Attention Temperature Enhances In-Context Learning under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained Transformers excel at in-context learning (ICL), inferring new tasks from only a handful of examples. Yet, their ICL performance can degrade sharply under distribution shift between pretraining and test data, a regime increasingly common in real-world deployments. While recent empirical work hints that adjusting the attention temperature in the softmax can enhance Transformer performance, the attention temperature's role in ICL under distribution shift remains unexplored. This paper provides the first theoretical and empirical study of attention temperature for ICL under distribution shift. Using a simplified but expressive "linearized softmax" framework, we derive closed-form generalization error expressions and prove that shifts in input covariance or label noise substantially impair ICL, but that an optimal attention temperature exists which minimizes this error. We then validate our predictions through extensive simulations on linear regression tasks and large-scale experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMA2-7B on question-answering benchmarks. Our results establish attention temperature as a principled and powerful mechanism for improving the robustness of ICL in pretrained Transformers, advancing theoretical understanding and providing actionable guidance for selecting attention temperature in practice.</description>

      <title>Partial Trace-Class Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) allow rigorous uncertainty quantification in deep learning, but often come at a prohibitive computational cost. We propose three different innovative architectures of partial trace-class Bayesian neural networks (PaTraC BNNs) that enable uncertainty quantification comparable to standard BNNs but use significantly fewer Bayesian parameters. These PaTraC BNNs have computational and statistical advantages over standard Bayesian neural networks in terms of speed and memory requirements. Our proposed methodology therefore facilitates reliable, robust, and scalable uncertainty quantification in neural networks. The three architectures build on trace-class neural network priors which induce an ordering of the neural network parameters, and are thus a natural choice in our framework. In a numerical simulation study, we verify the claimed benefits, and further illustrate the performance of our proposed methodology on a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Learning Rate Transfer under $\mu$P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first proof of learning rate transfer with width in a linear multi-layer perceptron (MLP) parametrized with $\mu$P, a neural network parameterization designed to ``maximize'' feature learning in the infinite-width limit. We show that under $\mu P$, the optimal learning rate converges to a \emph{non-zero constant} as width goes to infinity, providing a theoretical explanation to learning rate transfer. In contrast, we show that this property fails to hold under alternative parametrizations such as Standard Parametrization (SP) and Neural Tangent Parametrization (NTP). We provide intuitive proofs and support the theoretical findings with extensive empirical results.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Direct Forecast for Training Multi-Step Time-Series Forecast Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of training objective is central to training time-series forecasting models. Existing training objectives such as mean squared error mostly treat each future step as an independent, equally weighted task, which we found leading to the following two issues: (1) overlook the label autocorrelation effect among future steps, leading to biased training objective; (2) fail to set heterogeneous task weights for different forecasting tasks corresponding to varying future steps, limiting the forecasting performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel quadratic-form weighted training objective, addressing both of the issues simultaneously. Specifically, the off-diagonal elements of the weighting matrix account for the label autocorrelation effect, whereas the non-uniform diagonals are expected to match the most preferable weights of the forecasting tasks with varying future steps. To achieve this, we propose a Quadratic Direct Forecast (QDF) learning algorithm, which trains the forecast model using the adaptively updated quadratic-form weighting matrix. Experiments show that our QDF effectively improves performance of various forecast models, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/QDF-8937.</description>

      <title>SHAP values through General Fourier Representations: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a rigorous spectral framework for the mathematical analysis of SHAP values. We show that any predictive model defined on a discrete or multi-valued input space admits a generalized Fourier expansion with respect to an orthonormalisation tensor-product basis constructed under a product probability measure. Within this setting, each SHAP attribution can be represented as a linear functional of the model's Fourier coefficients.
  Two complementary regimes are studied. In the deterministic regime, we derive quantitative stability estimates for SHAP values under Fourier truncation, showing that the attribution map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the distance between predictors. In the probabilistic regime, we consider neural networks in their infinite-width limit and prove convergence of SHAP values toward those induced by the corresponding Gaussian process prior, with explicit error bounds in expectation and with high probability based on concentration inequalities.
  We also provide a numerical experiment on a clinical unbalanced dataset to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning for optimal trading with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied to financial problems has been the subject of a lively area of research. The use of RL for optimal trading strategies that exploit latent information in the market is, to the best of our knowledge, not widely tackled. In this paper we study an optimal trading problem, where a trading signal follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with regime-switching dynamics. We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information from the trading signal with latent parameters.
  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are filtered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived via RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step approach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL trader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of posterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on forecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with increasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's parameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find that prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more interpretable strategies. By contrast, reg-DDPG provides limited benefits, while hid-DDPG offers intermediate performance with less interpretable strategies. Our results show that the quality and structure of the information supplied to the agent are crucial: embedding probabilistic insights into latent regimes substantially improves both profitability and robustness of reinforcement learning-based trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Diffusion LLMs are Natural Adversaries for any LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that transforms the resource-intensive (adversarial) prompt optimization problem into an \emph{efficient, amortized inference task}. Our core insight is that pretrained, non-autoregressive generative LLMs, such as Diffusion LLMs, which model the joint distribution over prompt-response pairs, can serve as powerful surrogates for prompt search. This approach enables the direct conditional generation of prompts, effectively replacing costly, per-instance discrete optimization with a small number of parallelizable samples. We provide a probabilistic analysis demonstrating that under mild fidelity assumptions, only a few conditional samples are required to recover high-reward (harmful) prompts. Empirically, we find that the generated prompts are low-perplexity, diverse jailbreaks that exhibit strong transferability to a wide range of black-box target models, including robustly trained and proprietary LLMs. Beyond adversarial prompting, our framework opens new directions for red teaming, automated prompt optimization, and leveraging emerging Flow- and Diffusion-based LLMs.</description>

Abstract: We determine the minimax optimal expected regret in the classic non-stochastic multi-armed bandit with expert advice problem, by proving a lower bound that matches the upper bound of Kale (2014). The two bounds determine the minimax optimal expected regret to be $\Theta\left( \sqrt{T K \log (N/K) } \right)$, where $K$ is the number of arms, $N$ is the number of experts, and $T$ is the time horizon.</description>

      <title>A Technical Exploration of Causal Inference with Hybrid LLM Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a flexible means to generate synthetic tabular data, yet existing approaches often fail to preserve key causal parameters such as the average treatment effect (ATE). In this technical exploration, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art synthetic data generators, both GAN- and LLM-based, can achieve high predictive fidelity while substantially misestimating causal effects. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid generation framework that combines model-based covariate synthesis (monitored via distance-to-closest-record filtering) with separately learned propensity and outcome models, thereby ensuring that (W, A, Y) triplets retain their underlying causal structure. We further introduce a synthetic pairing strategy to mitigate positivity violations and a realistic evaluation protocol that leverages unlimited synthetic samples to benchmark traditional estimators (IPTW, AIPW, substitution) under complex covariate distributions. This work lays the groundwork for LLM-powered data pipelines that support robust causal analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xyc-arch/llm-synthetic-for-causal-inference.git.</description>

      <title>Toward Unifying Group Fairness Evaluation from a Sparsity Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring algorithmic fairness remains a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly as models are increasingly applied across diverse domains. While numerous fairness criteria exist, they often lack generalizability across different machine learning problems. This paper examines the connections and differences among various sparsity measures in promoting fairness and proposes a unified sparsity-based framework for evaluating algorithmic fairness. The framework aligns with existing fairness criteria and demonstrates broad applicability to a wide range of machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework as an evaluation metric through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and bias mitigation methods. This work provides a novel perspective to algorithmic fairness by framing it through the lens of sparsity and social equity, offering potential for broader impact on fairness research and applications.</description>

      <title>Trust-Region Methods with Low-Fidelity Objective Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two multifidelity trust-region methods based on the Magical Trust Region (MTR) framework. MTR augments the classical trust-region step with a secondary, informative direction. In our approaches, the secondary ``magical'' directions are determined by solving coarse trust-region subproblems based on low-fidelity objective models. The first proposed method, Sketched Trust-Region (STR), constructs this secondary direction using a sketched matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the trust-region subproblem. The second method, SVD Trust-Region (SVDTR), defines the magical direction via a truncated singular value decomposition of the dataset, capturing the leading directions of variability. Several numerical examples illustrate the potential gain in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Why Federated Optimization Fails to Achieve Perfect Fitting? A Theoretical Perspective on Client-Side Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated optimization is a constrained form of distributed optimization that enables training a global model without directly sharing client data. Although existing algorithms can guarantee convergence in theory and often achieve stable training in practice, the reasons behind performance degradation under data heterogeneity remain unclear. To address this gap, the main contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical perspective that explains why such degradation occurs. We introduce the assumption that heterogeneous client data lead to distinct local optima, and show that this assumption implies two key consequences: 1) the distance among clients' local optima raises the lower bound of the global objective, making perfect fitting of all client data impossible; and 2) in the final training stage, the global model oscillates within a region instead of converging to a single optimum, limiting its ability to fully fit the data. These results provide a principled explanation for performance degradation in non-iid settings, which we further validate through experiments across multiple tasks and neural network architectures. The framework used in this paper is open-sourced at: https://github.com/NPCLEI/fedtorch.</description>

      <title>Learning an Efficient Optimizer via Hybrid-Policy Sub-Trajectory Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable neural networks to generate weights without relying on gradient-based optimization. However, current methods are limited by issues of over-coupling and long-horizon. The former tightly binds weight generation with task-specific objectives, thereby limiting the flexibility of the learned optimizer. The latter leads to inefficiency and low accuracy during inference, caused by the lack of local constraints. In this paper, we propose Lo-Hp, a decoupled two-stage weight generation framework that enhances flexibility through learning various optimization policies. It adopts a hybrid-policy sub-trajectory balance objective, which integrates on-policy and off-policy learning to capture local optimization policies. Theoretically, we demonstrate that learning solely local optimization policies can address the long-horizon issue while enhancing the generation of global optimal weights. In addition, we validate Lo-Hp's superior accuracy and inference efficiency in tasks that require frequent weight updates, such as transfer learning, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and large language model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Sparse and nonparametric estimation of equations governing dynamical systems with applications to biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of model equations is a powerful approach for understanding the behavior of dynamical systems in many scientific fields. In particular, the ability to learn mathematical models from data would benefit systems biology, where the complex nature of these systems often makes a bottom up approach to modeling unfeasible. In recent years, sparse estimation techniques have gained prominence in system identification, primarily using parametric paradigms to efficiently capture system dynamics with minimal model complexity. In particular, the Sindy algorithm has successfully used sparsity to estimate nonlinear systems by extracting from a library of functions only a few key terms needed to capture the dynamics of these systems. However, parametric models often fall short in accurately representing certain nonlinearities inherent in complex systems. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that integrates sparse parametric estimation with nonparametric techniques. It captures nonlinearities that Sindy cannot describe without requiring a priori information about their functional form. That is, without expanding the library of functions to include the one that is trying to be discovered. We illustrate our approach on several examples related to estimation of complex biological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Belief Dynamics Reveal the Dual Nature of In-Context Learning and Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be controlled at inference time through prompts (in-context learning) and internal activations (activation steering). Different accounts have been proposed to explain these methods, yet their common goal of controlling model behavior raises the question of whether these seemingly disparate methodologies can be seen as specific instances of a broader framework. Motivated by this, we develop a unifying, predictive account of LLM control from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, we posit that both context- and activation-based interventions impact model behavior by altering its belief in latent concepts: steering operates by changing concept priors, while in-context learning leads to an accumulation of evidence. This results in a closed-form Bayesian model that is highly predictive of LLM behavior across context- and activation-based interventions in a set of domains inspired by prior work on many-shot in-context learning. This model helps us explain prior empirical phenomena - e.g., sigmoidal learning curves as in-context evidence accumulates - while predicting novel ones - e.g., additivity of both interventions in log-belief space, which results in distinct phases such that sudden and dramatic behavioral shifts can be induced by slightly changing intervention controls. Taken together, this work offers a unified account of prompt-based and activation-based control of LLM behavior, and a methodology for empirically predicting the effects of these interventions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Shortest Path with Sparse Adversarial Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the adversarial Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem with sparse costs under full-information feedback. In the known transition setting, existing bounds based on Online Mirror Descent (OMD) with negative-entropy regularization scale with $\sqrt{\log S A}$, where $SA$ is the size of the state-action space. While we show that this is optimal in the worst-case, this bound fails to capture the benefits of sparsity when only a small number $M \ll SA$ of state-action pairs incur cost. In fact, we also show that the negative-entropy is inherently non-adaptive to sparsity: it provably incurs regret scaling with $\sqrt{\log S}$ on sparse problems. Instead, we propose a family of $\ell_r$-norm regularizers ($r \in (1,2)$) that adapts to the sparsity and achieves regret scaling with $\sqrt{\log M}$ instead of $\sqrt{\log SA}$. We show this is optimal via a matching lower bound, highlighting that $M$ captures the effective dimension of the problem instead of $SA$. Finally, in the unknown transition setting the benefits of sparsity are limited: we prove that even on sparse problems, the minimax regret for any learner scales polynomially with $SA$.</description>

      <title>Diluting Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have relied heavily on increasingly large neural networks, raising concerns about their computational and environmental costs. This paper investigates whether simpler, sparser networks can maintain strong performance by studying Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) under extreme pruning conditions. Inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, we demonstrate that RBMs can achieve high-quality generative performance even when up to 80% of the connections are pruned before training, confirming that they contain viable sub-networks. However, our experiments reveal crucial limitations: trained networks cannot fully recover lost performance through retraining once additional pruning is applied. We identify a sharp transition above which the generative quality degrades abruptly when pruning disrupts a minimal core of essential connections. Moreover, re-trained networks remain constrained by the parameters originally learned performing worse than networks trained from scratch at equivalent sparsity levels. These results suggest that for sparse networks to work effectively, pruning should be implemented early in training rather than attempted afterwards. Our findings provide practical insights for the development of efficient neural architectures and highlight the persistent influence of initial conditions on network capabilities.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Robustness of Knowledge Tracing Models in the Presence of Student Concept Drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) has been an established problem in the educational data mining field for decades, and it is commonly assumed that the underlying learning process be- ing modeled remains static. Given the ever-changing land- scape of online learning platforms (OLPs), we investigate how concept drift and changing student populations can im- pact student behavior within an OLP through testing model performance both within a single academic year and across multiple academic years. Four well-studied KT models were applied to five academic years of data to assess how suscep- tible KT models are to concept drift. Through our analysis, we find that all four families of KT models can exhibit de- graded performance, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) remains the most stable KT model when applied to newer data, while more complex, attention based models lose pre- dictive power significantly faster. To foster more longitu- dinal evaluations of KT models, the data used to conduct our analysis is available at https://osf.io/hvfn9/?view_ only=b936c63dfdae4b0b987a2f0d4038f72a</description>

      <title>Polynomial Mixing Times of Simulated Tempering for Mixture Targets by Conductance Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the theoretical complexity of simulated tempering for sampling from mixtures of log-concave components differing only by location shifts. The main result establishes the first polynomial-time guarantee for simulated tempering combined with the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) with respect to the problem dimension $d$, maximum mode displacement $D$, and logarithmic accuracy $\log \epsilon^{-1}$. The proof builds on a general state decomposition theorem for $s$-conductance, applied to an auxiliary Markov chain constructed on an augmented space. We also obtain an improved complexity estimate for simulated tempering combined with random-walk Metropolis. Our bounds assume an inverse-temperature ladder with smallest value $\beta_1 = O(D^{-2})$ and spacing $\beta_{i+1}/\beta_i = 1 + O( d^{-1/2} )$, both of which are shown to be asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Cross-Validated Causal Inference: a Modern Method to Combine Experimental and Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop new methods to integrate experimental and observational data in causal inference. While randomized controlled trials offer strong internal validity, they are often costly and therefore limited in sample size. Observational data, though cheaper and often with larger sample sizes, are prone to biases due to unmeasured confounders. To harness their complementary strengths, we propose a systematic framework that formulates causal estimation as an empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem. A full model containing the causal parameter is obtained by minimizing a weighted combination of experimental and observational losses--capturing the causal parameter's validity and the full model's fit, respectively. The weight is chosen through cross-validation on the causal parameter across experimental folds. Our experiments on real and synthetic data show the efficacy and reliability of our method. We also provide theoretical non-asymptotic error bounds.</description>

      <title>Random Spiking Neural Networks are Stable and Spectrally Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising paradigm for energy-efficient computation, yet their theoretical foundations-especially regarding stability and robustness-remain limited compared to artificial neural networks. In this work, we study discrete-time leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) SNNs through the lens of Boolean function analysis. We focus on noise sensitivity and stability in classification tasks, quantifying how input perturbations affect outputs. Our main result shows that wide LIF-SNN classifiers are stable on average, a property explained by the concentration of their Fourier spectrum on low-frequency components. Motivated by this, we introduce the notion of spectral simplicity, which formalizes simplicity in terms of Fourier spectrum concentration and connects our analysis to the simplicity bias observed in deep networks. Within this framework, we show that random LIF-SNNs are biased toward simple functions. Experiments on trained networks confirm that these stability properties persist in practice. Together, these results provide new insights into the stability and robustness properties of SNNs.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Power of Normalization: Exponential Capacity Control in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalization methods are fundamental components of modern deep neural networks (DNNs). Empirically, they are known to stabilize optimization dynamics and improve generalization. However, the underlying theoretical mechanism by which normalization contributes to both optimization and generalization remains largely unexplained, especially when using many normalization layers in a DNN architecture.
  In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that elucidates the role of normalization through the lens of capacity control. We prove that an unnormalized DNN can exhibit exponentially large Lipschitz constants with respect to either its parameters or inputs, implying excessive functional capacity and potential overfitting. Such bad DNNs are uncountably many. In contrast, the insertion of normalization layers provably can reduce the Lipschitz constant at an exponential rate in the number of normalization operations. This exponential reduction yields two fundamental consequences: (1) it smooths the loss landscape at an exponential rate, facilitating faster and more stable optimization; and (2) it constrains the effective capacity of the network, thereby enhancing generalization guarantees on unseen data. Our results thus offer a principled explanation for the empirical success of normalization methods in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Happiness as a Measure of Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel fairness framework grounded in the concept of happi- ness, a measure of the utility each group gains fromdecisionoutcomes. Bycapturingfairness through this intuitive lens, we not only offer a more human-centered approach, but also one that is mathematically rigorous: In order to compute the optimal, fair post-processing strategy, only a linear program needs to be solved. This makes our method both efficient and scalable with existing optimization tools. Furthermore, it unifies and extends several well-known fairness definitions, and our em- pirical results highlight its practical strengths across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Regularization Implies balancedness in the deep linear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use geometric invariant theory (GIT) to study the deep linear network (DLN). The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map.
  This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Power of Chain of Thought through Memorization Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that the chain of thought (CoT) can enhance the power of large language models (LLMs) to solve certain mathematical reasoning problems. However, the capacity of CoT is still not fully explored. As an important instance, the following basic question has not yet been answered: Does CoT expand the capability of transformers across all reasoning tasks? We demonstrate that reasoning with transformers is essentially a memorization problem for reasoning datasets. Thus, examining the power of CoT across all reasoning tasks amounts to analyzing the memorization capabilities of CoT transformers. In this paper, we give a complete description of the memorization capabilities of fixed-precision transformers with or without CoT and give a negative answer to the above-mentioned question. Precisely, we first give necessary and sufficient conditions for fixed-precision transformers with and without CoT to memorize a finite reasoning dataset and show that these two conditions do not imply each other. Then, we give lower and upper bounds for the number of parameters needed for transformers with or without CoT to memorize a finite reasoning dataset with $N$ elements, which are $\overline{\Theta}(N)$ in all cases. This implies that there exist reasoning tasks for which CoT does not enhance the reasoning power of transformers, leading to a negative answer to the above-mentioned question. Finally, we give the first results on memorizing infinite reasoning datasets by CoT transformers and show that some simple infinite datasets cannot be memorized by transformers with or without CoT.</description>

      <title>A Saddle Point Remedy: Power of Variable Elimination in Non-convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of saddle points, rather than poor local minima, is increasingly understood to be a primary obstacle in large-scale non-convex optimization for machine learning. Variable elimination algorithms, like Variable Projection (VarPro), have long been observed to exhibit superior convergence and robustness in practice, yet a principled understanding of why they so effectively navigate these complex energy landscapes has remained elusive. In this work, we provide a rigorous geometric explanation by comparing the optimization landscapes of the original and reduced formulations. Through a rigorous analysis based on Hessian inertia and the Schur complement, we prove that variable elimination fundamentally reshapes the critical point structure of the objective function, revealing that local maxima in the reduced landscape are created from, and correspond directly to, saddle points in the original formulation. Our findings are illustrated on the canonical problem of non-convex matrix factorization, visualized directly on two-parameter neural networks, and finally validated in training deep Residual Networks, where our approach yields dramatic improvements in stability and convergence to superior minima. This work goes beyond explaining an existing method; it establishes landscape simplification via saddle point transformation as a powerful principle that can guide the design of a new generation of more robust and efficient optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Online Robust Tensor Recovery Approach for Streaming Traffic Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However, traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.</description>

      <title>HFNO: an interpretable data-driven decomposition strategy for turbulent flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have demonstrated exceptional accuracy in mapping functional spaces by leveraging Fourier transforms to establish a connection with underlying physical principles. However, their opaque inner workings often constitute an obstacle to physical interpretability. This work introduces Hierarchical Fourier Neural Operators (HFNOs), a novel FNO-based architecture tailored for reduced-order modeling of turbulent fluid flows, designed to enhance interpretability by explicitly separating fluid behavior across scales. The proposed architecture processes wavenumber bins in parallel, enabling the approximation of dispersion relations and non-linear interactions. Inputs are lifted to a higher-dimensional space, Fourier-transformed, and partitioned into wavenumber bins. Each bin is processed by a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), with outputs subsequently padded, summed, and inverse-transformed back into physical space. A final transformation refines the output in physical space as a correction model, by means of one of the following architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Echo State Network (ESN). We evaluate the proposed model on a series of increasingly complex dynamical systems: first on the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, then on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and finally on the prediction of wall shear stress in turbulent channel flow, given the near-wall velocity field. In all test cases, the model demonstrates its ability to decompose turbulent flows across various scales, opening up the possibility of increased interpretability and multiscale modeling of such flows.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Toeplitz Covariance Matrices using Overparameterized Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider covariance estimation under Toeplitz structure. Numerous sophisticated optimization methods have been developed to maximize the Gaussian log-likelihood under Toeplitz constraints. In contrast, recent advances in deep learning demonstrate the surprising power of simple gradient descent (GD) applied to overparameterized models. Motivated by this trend, we revisit Toeplitz covariance estimation through the lens of overparameterized GD. We model the $P\times P$ covariance as a sum of $K$ complex sinusoids with learnable parameters and optimize them via GD. We show that when $K = P$, GD may converge to suboptimal solutions. However, mild overparameterization ($K = 2P$ or $4P$) consistently enables global convergence from random initializations. We further propose an accelerated GD variant with separate learning rates for amplitudes and frequencies. When frequencies are fixed and only amplitudes are optimized, we prove that the optimization landscape is asymptotically benign and any stationary point recovers the true covariance. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that overparameterized GD can match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods in challenging settings, while remaining simple and scalable.</description>

      <title>Cross-Treatment Effect Estimation for Multi-Category, Multi-Valued Causal Inference via Dynamic Neural Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual causal inference faces significant challenges when extended to multi-category, multi-valued treatments, where complex cross-effects between heterogeneous interventions are difficult to model. Existing methodologies remain constrained to binary or single-type treatments and suffer from restrictive assumptions, limited scalability, and inadequate evaluation frameworks for complex intervention scenarios.
  We present XTNet, a novel network architecture for multi-category, multi-valued treatment effect estimation. Our approach introduces a cross-effect estimation module with dynamic masking mechanisms to capture treatment interactions without restrictive structural assumptions. The architecture employs a decomposition strategy separating basic effects from cross-treatment interactions, enabling efficient modeling of combinatorial treatment spaces. We also propose MCMV-AUCC, a suitable evaluation metric that accounts for treatment costs and interaction effects. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that XTNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both ranking accuracy and effect estimation quality. The results of the real-world A/B test further confirm its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Fractional Diffusion Bridge Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Fractional Diffusion Bridge Models (FDBM), a novel generative diffusion bridge framework driven by an approximation of the rich and non-Markovian fractional Brownian motion (fBM). Real stochastic processes exhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range dependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured in standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion (BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM), we construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the non-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving generative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from paired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data translation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein conformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation. In both settings, FDBM achieves superior performance compared to the Brownian baselines, yielding lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of C$_\alpha$ atomic positions in protein structure prediction and lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) in unpaired image translation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lifelong learning, a learner faces a sequence of tasks with shared structure and aims to identify and leverage it to accelerate learning. We study the setting where such structure is captured by a common representation of data. Unlike multi-task learning or learning-to-learn, where tasks are available upfront to learn the representation, lifelong learning requires the learner to make use of its existing knowledge while continually gathering partial information in an online fashion. In this paper, we consider a generalized framework of lifelong representation learning. We propose a simple algorithm that uses multi-task empirical risk minimization as a subroutine and establish a sample complexity bound based on a new notion we introduce--the task-eluder dimension. Our result applies to a wide range of learning problems involving general function classes. As concrete examples, we instantiate our result on classification and regression tasks under noise.</description>

Abstract: Finding equilibrium points in continuous minmax games has become a key problem within machine learning, in part due to its connection to the training of generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. Because of existence and robustness issues, recent developments have shifted from pure equilibria to focusing on mixed equilibrium points. In this work we consider a method for finding mixed equilibria in two-layer zero-sum games based on entropic regularisation, where the two competing strategies are represented by two sets of interacting particles. We show that the sequence of empirical measures of the particle system satisfies a large deviation principle as the number of particles grows to infinity, and how this implies convergence of the empirical measure and the associated Nikaid\^o-Isoda error, complementing existing law of large numbers results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian tensor regression model to accommodate the effect of multiple factors on phenotype prediction. We adopt a set of prior distributions that resolve identifiability issues that may arise between the parameters in the model. Further, we incorporate a spike-and-slab structure that identifies which interactions are relevant for inclusion in the linear predictor, even when they form a subset of the available variables. Simulation experiments show that our method outperforms previous related models and machine learning algorithms under different sample sizes and degrees of complexity. We further explore the applicability of our model by analysing real-world data related to wheat production across Ireland from 2010 to 2019. Our model performs competitively and overcomes key limitations found in other analogous approaches. Finally, we adapt a set of visualisations for the posterior distribution of the tensor effects that facilitate the identification of optimal interactions between the tensor variables, whilst accounting for the uncertainty in the posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference in Location-Scale Families: Exact Recovery of the Mean and Correlation Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an intractable target density $p$, variational inference (VI) attempts to find the best approximation $q$ from a tractable family $Q$. This is typically done by minimizing the exclusive Kullback-Leibler divergence, $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In practice, $Q$ is not rich enough to contain $p$, and the approximation is misspecified even when it is a unique global minimizer of $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of VI to these misspecifications when $p$ exhibits certain symmetries and $Q$ is a location-scale family that shares these symmetries. We prove strong guarantees for VI not only under mild regularity conditions but also in the face of severe misspecifications. Namely, we show that (i) VI recovers the mean of $p$ when $p$ exhibits an \textit{even} symmetry, and (ii) it recovers the correlation matrix of $p$ when in addition~$p$ exhibits an \textit{elliptical} symmetry. These guarantees hold for the mean even when $q$ is factorized and $p$ is not, and for the correlation matrix even when~$q$ and~$p$ behave differently in their tails. We analyze various regimes of Bayesian inference where these symmetries are useful idealizations, and we also investigate experimentally how VI behaves in their absence.</description>

      <title>Double Descent Meets Out-of-Distribution Detection: Theoretical Insights and Empirical Analysis on the role of model complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning systems. In recent years, it has received increasing attention, particularly through post-hoc detection and training-based methods. In this paper, we focus on post-hoc OOD detection, which enables identifying OOD samples without altering the model's training procedure or objective. Our primary goal is to investigate the relationship between model capacity and its OOD detection performance. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: Does the Double Descent phenomenon manifest in post-hoc OOD detection? This question is crucial, as it can reveal whether overparameterization, which is already known to benefit generalization, can also enhance OOD detection. Despite the growing interest in these topics by the classic supervised machine learning community, this intersection remains unexplored for OOD detection. We empirically demonstrate that the Double Descent effect does indeed appear in post-hoc OOD detection. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights to explain why this phenomenon emerges in such setting. Finally, we show that the overparameterized regime does not yield superior results consistently, and we propose a method to identify the optimal regime for OOD detection based on our observations.</description>

      <title>Wait-Less Offline Tuning and Re-solving for Online Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online linear programming (OLP) has found broad applications in revenue management and resource allocation. State-of-the-art OLP algorithms achieve low regret by repeatedly solving linear programming (LP) subproblems that incorporate updated resource information. However, LP-based methods are computationally expensive and often inefficient for large-scale applications. In contrast, recent first-order OLP algorithms are more computationally efficient but typically suffer from worse regret guarantees. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new algorithm that combines the strengths of LP-based and first-order OLP methods. The algorithm re-solves the LP subproblems periodically at a predefined frequency $f$ and uses the latest dual prices to guide online decision-making. In addition, a first-order method runs in parallel during each interval between LP re-solves, smoothing resource consumption. Our algorithm achieves $\mathscr{O}(\log (T/f) + \sqrt{f})$ regret, delivering a "wait-less" online decision-making process that balances the computational efficiency of first-order methods and the superior regret guarantee of LP-based methods.</description>

      <title>Differential privacy guarantees of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In a first part, we establish DP guarantees on samples output by MCMC algorithms as well as Monte Carlo estimators associated with these methods under assumptions on the convergence properties of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, our results highlight the critical condition of ensuring the target distribution is differentially private itself. In a second part, we specialise our analysis to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and establish guarantees on their (R\'enyi) DP. To this end, we develop a novel methodology based on Girsanov's theorem combined with a perturbation trick to obtain bounds for an unbounded domain and in a non-convex setting. We establish: (i) uniform in $n$ privacy guarantees when the state of the chain after $n$ iterations is released, (ii) bounds on the privacy of the entire chain trajectory. These findings provide concrete guidelines for privacy-preserving MCMC.</description>

      <title>Behavior of prediction performance metrics with rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC) is commonly reported alongside prediction models for binary outcomes. Recent articles have raised concerns that AUC might be a misleading measure of prediction performance in the rare event setting. This setting is common since many events of clinical importance are rare. We aimed to determine whether the bias and variance of AUC are driven by the number of events or the event rate. We also investigated the behavior of other commonly used measures of prediction performance, including positive predictive value, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
  Study Design and Setting: We conducted a simulation study to determine when or whether AUC is unstable in the rare event setting by varying the size of datasets used to train and evaluate prediction models. This plasmode simulation study was based on data from the Mental Health Research Network; the data contained 149 predictors and the outcome of interest, suicide attempt, which had event rate 0.92\% in the original dataset.
  Results: Our results indicate that poor AUC behavior -- as measured by empirical bias, variability of cross-validated AUC estimates, and empirical coverage of confidence intervals -- is driven by the number of events in a rare-event setting, not event rate. Performance of sensitivity is driven by the number of events, while that of specificity is driven by the number of non-events. Other measures, including positive predictive value and accuracy, depend on the event rate even in large samples.
  Conclusion: AUC is reliable in the rare event setting provided that the total number of events is moderately large; in our simulations, we observed near zero bias with 1000 events.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Learning of Causal Graphs from Hard Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the empirical sciences involves uncovering causal structure through observation and experimentation. Causal discovery entails linking the conditional independence (CI) invariances in observational data to their corresponding graphical constraints via d-separation. In this paper, we consider a general setting where we have access to data from multiple experimental distributions resulting from hard interventions, as well as potentially from an observational distribution. By comparing different interventional distributions, we propose a set of graphical constraints that are fundamentally linked to Pearl's do-calculus within the framework of hard interventions. These graphical constraints associate each graphical structure with a set of interventional distributions that are consistent with the rules of do-calculus. We characterize the interventional equivalence class of causal graphs with latent variables and introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine whether two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent, i.e., whether they are associated with the same family of hard interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances from do-calculus. We also propose a learning algorithm to integrate multiple datasets from hard interventions, introducing new orientation rules. The learning objective is a tuple of augmented graphs which entails a set of causal graphs. We also prove the soundness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>When Models Don't Collapse: On the Consistency of Iterative MLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread use of generative models has created a feedback loop, in which each generation of models is trained on data partially produced by its predecessors. This process has raised concerns about model collapse: A critical degradation in performance caused by repeated training on synthetic data. However, different analyses in the literature have reached different conclusions as to the severity of model collapse. As such, it remains unclear how concerning this phenomenon is, and under which assumptions it can be avoided. To address this, we theoretically study model collapse for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), in a natural setting where synthetic data is gradually added to the original data set. Under standard assumptions (similar to those long used for proving asymptotic consistency and normality of MLE), we establish non-asymptotic bounds showing that collapse can be avoided even as the fraction of real data vanishes. On the other hand, we prove that some assumptions (beyond MLE consistency) are indeed necessary: Without them, model collapse can occur arbitrarily quickly, even when the original data is still present in the training set. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous examples of iterative generative modeling with accumulating data that rapidly leads to model collapse.</description>

      <title>Large Stepsizes Accelerate Gradient Descent for Regularized Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data. Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize -- for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with finite minimizers.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching for Tree-Structured Costs and Entropic Wasserstein Barycentres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in flow-based generative modelling have provided scalable methods for computing the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) between distributions, a dynamic form of entropy-regularised Optimal Transport (OT) for the quadratic cost. The successful Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure solves the SB problem via sequential bridge-matching steps, presenting an elegant and practical approach with many favourable properties over the more traditional Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Beyond the standard setting, optimal transport can be generalised to the multi-marginal case in which the objective is to minimise a cost defined over several marginal distributions. Of particular importance are costs defined over a tree structure, from which Wasserstein barycentres can be recovered as a special case. In this work, we extend the IMF procedure to solve for the tree-structured SB problem. Our resulting algorithm inherits the many advantages of IMF over IPF approaches in the tree-based setting. In the case of Wasserstein barycentres, our approach can be viewed as extending the widely used fixed-point approach to use flow-based entropic OT solvers, while requiring only simple bridge-matching steps at each iteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.</description>

The algorithm can be used to find exact hyperparameters that optimize leave-one-out cross-validation either globally or locally, and its practicality is demonstrated on real-world data sets. I also show how the algorithm can be modified to compute approximate leave-one-out cross-validation, making it suitable for larger data sets.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Improving Shampoo and SOAP via Kullback-Leibler Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shampoo and its efficient variant, SOAP, employ structured second-moment estimations and have shown strong performance for training neural networks (NNs). In practice, however, Shampoo typically requires step-size grafting with Adam to be competitive, and SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis -- at the cost of additional memory overhead from Adam in both methods. Prior analyses have largely relied on the Frobenius norm to motivate these estimation schemes. We instead recast their estimation procedures as covariance estimation under Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization, revealing a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivating principled redesigns. Building on this perspective, we develop $\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\textbf{KL-SOAP}$, practical schemes that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP in NN pre-training while achieving SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to attain competitive performance, eliminating the memory overhead introduced by Adam. Across our experiments, KL-Shampoo consistently outperforms SOAP, Shampoo, and even KL-SOAP, establishing the KL-based approach as a compelling foundation for designing structured methods in NN optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local principal component analysis (Local PCA) has proven to be an effective tool for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a manifold. More recently, curvature-adjusted PCA (CA-PCA) has improved upon this approach by explicitly accounting for the curvature of the underlying manifold, rather than assuming local flatness. Building on these insights, we propose a general framework for manifold dimension estimation that captures the manifold's local graph structure by integrating PCA with regression-based techniques. Within this framework, we introduce two representative estimators: quadratic embedding (QE) and total least squares (TLS). Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that these methods perform competitively with, and often outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MMbeddings, a probabilistic embedding approach that reinterprets categorical embeddings through the lens of nonlinear mixed models, effectively bridging classical statistical theory with modern deep learning. By treating embeddings as latent random effects within a variational autoencoder framework, our method substantially decreases the number of parameters -- from the conventional embedding approach of cardinality $\times$ embedding dimension, which quickly becomes infeasible with large cardinalities, to a significantly smaller, cardinality-independent number determined primarily by the encoder architecture. This reduction dramatically mitigates overfitting and computational burden in high-cardinality settings. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets, encompassing collaborative filtering and tabular regression tasks using varied architectures, demonstrate that MMbeddings consistently outperforms traditional embeddings, underscoring its potential across diverse machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Selecting the Best Optimizing System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate selecting the best optimizing system (SBOS) problems and provide solutions for those problems. In an SBOS problem, a finite number of systems are contenders. Inside each system, a continuous decision variable affects the system's expected performance. An SBOS problem compares different systems based on their expected performances under their own optimally chosen decision to select the best, without advance knowledge of expected performances of the systems nor the optimizing decision inside each system. We design easy-to-implement algorithms that adaptively chooses a system and a choice of decision to evaluate the noisy system performance, sequentially eliminates inferior systems, and eventually recommends a system as the best after spending a user-specified budget. The proposed algorithms integrate the stochastic gradient descent method and the sequential elimination method to simultaneously exploit the structure inside each system and make comparisons across systems. For the proposed algorithms, we prove exponential rates of convergence to zero for the probability of false selection, as the budget grows to infinity. We conduct three numerical examples that represent three practical cases of SBOS problems. Our proposed algorithms demonstrate consistent and stronger performances in terms of the probability of false selection over benchmark algorithms under a range of problem settings and sampling budgets.</description>

      <title>Ranking hierarchical multi-label classification results with mLPRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) has gained considerable attention in recent decades. A seminal line of HMC research addresses the problem in two stages: first, training individual classifiers for each class, then integrating these classifiers to provide a unified set of classification results across classes while respecting the given hierarchy. In this article, we focus on the less attended second-stage question while adhering to the given class hierarchy. This involves addressing a key challenge: how to manage the hierarchical constraint and account for statistical differences in the first-stage classifier scores across different classes to make classification decisions that are optimal under a justifiable criterion. To address this challenge, we introduce a new objective function, called CATCH, to ensure reasonable classification performance. To optimize this function, we propose a decision strategy built on a novel metric, the multidimensional Local Precision Rate (mLPR), which reflects the membership chance of an object in a class given all classifier scores and the class hierarchy. Particularly, we demonstrate that, under certain conditions, transforming the classifier scores into mLPRs and comparing mLPR values for all objects against all classes can, in theory, ensure the class hierarchy and maximize CATCH. In practice, we propose an algorithm HierRank to rank estimated mLPRs under the hierarchical constraint, leading to a ranking that maximizes an empirical version of CATCH. Our approach was evaluated on a synthetic dataset and two real datasets, exhibiting superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved decision accuracy.</description>

      <title>ORFit: One-Pass Learning via Bridging Orthogonal Gradient Descent and Recursive Least-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large machine learning models have shown remarkable performance in various domains, their training typically requires iterating for many passes over the training data. However, due to computational and memory constraints and potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data is impractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream. In this paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a model is trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous datapoints. Motivated by the demonstrated effectiveness of overparameterized models and the phenomenon of benign overfitting, we propose Orthogonal Recursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass learning which seeks to perfectly fit each new datapoint while minimally altering the predictions on previous datapoints. ORFit updates the parameters in a direction orthogonal to past gradients, similar to orthogonal gradient descent (OGD) in continual learning. We show that, interestingly, ORFit's update leads to an operation similar to the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm in adaptive filtering but with significantly improved memory and computational efficiency, i.e., linear, instead of quadratic, in the number of parameters. To further reduce memory usage, we leverage the structure of the streaming data via an incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). We show that using the principal components is minimax optimal, i.e., it minimizes the worst-case forgetting of previous predictions for unknown future updates. Further, we prove that, for overparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtained by ORFit matches what the standard multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) would converge to. Finally, we extend our results to the nonlinear setting for highly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning.</description>

      <title>On the Variance, Admissibility, and Stability of Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) may attain minimax suboptimal rates in terms of the mean squared error (Birg\'e and Massart, 1993). In this paper, we prove that, under relatively mild assumptions, the suboptimality of ERM must be due to its large bias. Namely, the variance error term of ERM is bounded by the minimax rate. In the fixed design setting, we provide an elementary proof of this result using the probabilistic method. Then, we extend our proof to the random design setting for various models.
  In addition, we provide a simple proof of Chatterjee's admissibility theorem (Chatterjee, 2014, Theorem 1.4), which states that in the fixed design setting, ERM cannot be ruled out as an optimal method, and then we extend this result to the random design setting. We also show that our estimates imply the stability of ERM, complementing the main result of Caponnetto and Rakhlin (2006) for non-Donsker classes. Finally, we highlight the somewhat irregular nature of the loss landscape of ERM in the non-Donsker regime, by showing that functions can be close to ERM, in terms of $L_2$ distance, while still being far from almost-minimizers of the empirical loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13712v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present DiEM, a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, DiEM leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our methods, we propose and motivate an improved posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>SLIP: Securing LLMs IP Using Weights Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently seen widespread adoption in both academia and industry. As these models grow, they become valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting substantial investments by their owners. The high cost of cloud-based deployment has spurred interest in running models on edge devices, but this risks exposing parameters to theft and unauthorized use. Existing approaches to protect model IP on the edge trade off practicality, accuracy, or deployment requirements. We introduce SLIP, a hybrid inference algorithm designed to protect edge-deployed models from theft. SLIP is, to our knowledge, the first hybrid protocol that is both practical for real-world applications and provably secure, while incurring zero accuracy degradation and minimal latency overhead. It partitions the model across two computing resources: one secure but expensive, and one cost-effective but vulnerable. Using matrix decomposition, the secure resource retains the most sensitive portion of the model's IP while performing only a small fraction of the computation; the vulnerable resource executes the remainder. The protocol includes security guarantees that prevent attackers from using the partition to infer the protected information. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, positioning it as a compelling solution for protecting LLMs.</description>

      <title>Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, demonstrates an improved performance compared to the basic QNG. In this paper we benchmark Momentum-QNG together with the basic QNG, Adam and Momentum optimizers and explore its convergence behaviour. Among the benchmarking problems studied, the best result is obtained for the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the strong spin glass regime. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/borbysh/Momentum-QNG</description>

      <title>Robust semi-parametric signal detection in particle physics with classifiers decorrelated via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for signals of new physics in particle physics are usually done by training a supervised classifier to separate a signal model from the known Standard Model physics (also called the background model). However, even when the signal model is correct, systematic errors in the background model can influence supervised classifiers and might adversely affect the signal detection procedure. To tackle this problem, one approach is to use the (possibly misspecified) classifier only to perform a preliminary signal-enrichment step and then to carry out a signal detection test on the signal-rich sample. For this procedure to work, we need a classifier constrained to be decorrelated with one or more protected variables used for the signal-detection step. We do this by considering an optimal transport map of the classifier output that makes it independent of the protected variable(s) for the background. We then fit a semiparametric mixture model to the distribution of the protected variable after making cuts on the transformed classifier to detect the presence of a signal. We compare and contrast this decorrelation method with previous approaches, show that the decorrelation procedure is robust to moderate background misspecification, and analyze the power and validity of the signal detection test as a function of the cut on the classifier both with and without decorrelation. We conclude that decorrelation and signal enrichment help produce a stable, robust, valid, and more powerful test.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Learning: reverse causal inference in the presence of multiple unknown confounding through causally weighted Gaussian mixture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of machine learning (ML) prediction models is that they recover associational, rather than causal, predictive relationships between variables. In high-stakes automation applications of ML this is problematic, as the model often learns spurious, non-causal associations. This paper proposes mechanism learning, a simple method which uses causally weighted Gaussian Mixture Models (CW-GMMs) to deconfound observational data such that any appropriate ML model is forced to learn predictive relationships between effects and their causes (reverse causal inference), despite the potential presence of multiple unknown and unmeasured confounding. Effect variables can be very high-dimensional, and the predictive relationship nonlinear, as is common in ML applications. This novel method is widely applicable, the only requirement is the existence of a set of mechanism variables mediating the cause (prediction target) and effect (feature data), which is independent of the (unmeasured) confounding variables. We test our method on fully synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that it can discover reliable, unbiased, causal ML predictors where by contrast, the same ML predictor trained naively using classical supervised learning on the original observational data, is heavily biased by spurious associations. We provide code to implement the results in the paper, online.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias in Matrix Factorization and its Explicit Realization in a New Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent for matrix factorization exhibits an implicit bias toward approximately low-rank solutions. While existing theories often assume the boundedness of iterates, empirically the bias persists even with unbounded sequences. This reflects a dynamic where factors develop low-rank structure while their magnitudes increase, tending to align with certain directions. To capture this behavior in a stable way, we introduce a new factorization model: $X\approx UDV^\top$, where $U$ and $V$ are constrained within norm balls, while $D$ is a diagonal factor allowing the model to span the entire search space. Experiments show that this model consistently exhibits a strong implicit bias, yielding truly (rather than approximately) low-rank solutions. Extending the idea to neural networks, we introduce a new model featuring constrained layers and diagonal components that achieves competitive performance on various regression and classification tasks while producing lightweight, low-rank representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Type 2 Tobit Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (TOBART-2). BART can produce accurate individual-specific treatment effect estimates. However, in practice estimates are often biased by sample selection. We extend the Type 2 Tobit sample selection model to account for nonlinearities and model uncertainty by including sums of trees in both the selection and outcome equations. A Dirichlet Process Mixture distribution for the error terms allows for departure from the assumption of bivariate normally distributed errors. Soft trees and a Dirichlet prior on splitting probabilities improve modeling of smooth and sparse data generating processes. We include a simulation study and an application to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generative framework for functions by integrating Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Transformer-based hypernetworks into latent variable models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables, addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming: a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining. We validate our approach across multiple modalities, demonstrating improved scalability, expressiveness, and generalization over existing INR-based generative models. Our findings establish a unified and flexible framework for learning structured function representations.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show how different machine learning tools on the Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{P}_d$ of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices can be united under a probabilistic framework. For this, we will need several Gaussian distributions defined on $\mathcal{P}_d$. We will show how popular classifiers on $\mathcal{P}_d$ can be reinterpreted as Bayes Classifiers using these Gaussian distributions. These distributions will also be used for outlier detection and dimension reduction. By showing that those distributions are pervasive in the tools used on $\mathcal{P}_d$, we allow for other machine learning tools to be extended to $\mathcal{P}_d$.</description>

      <title>Dequantified Diffusion-Schr{\"o}dinger Bridge for Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05034v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences, yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or inadequately overlapping supports -- the density-chasm and the support-chasm problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We design $\textbf{D}^3\textbf{RE}$, a unified framework for \textbf{robust}, \textbf{stable} and \textbf{efficient} density ratio estimation. We propose the dequantified diffusion bridge interpolant (DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the proposed dequantified Schr{\"o}dinger bridge interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Distributionally Robust Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning. We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP), while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set. Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}| t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here, $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Framework for Understanding Modern Machine-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic framework that views learning as universal prediction under log loss, characterized through regret bounds. Central to the framework is an effective notion of architecture-based model complexity, defined by the probability mass or volume of models in the vicinity of the data-generating process, or its projection on the model class. This volume is related to spectral properties of the expected Hessian or the Fisher Information Matrix, leading to tractable approximations. We argue that successful architectures possess a broad complexity range, enabling learning in highly over-parameterized model classes. The framework sheds light on the role of inductive biases, the effectiveness of stochastic gradient descent, and phenomena such as flat minima. It unifies online, batch, supervised, and generative settings, and applies across the stochastic-realizable and agnostic regimes. Moreover, it provides insights into the success of modern machine-learning architectures, such as deep neural networks and transformers, suggesting that their broad complexity range naturally arises from their layered structure. These insights open the door to the design of alternative architectures with potentially comparable or even superior performance.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your LLM Web Agent: A Statistical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</description>

Abstract: Information technology is in the midst of a revolution in which omnipresent data collection and machine learning are impacting the human world as never before. The word "intelligence" is being used as a North Star for the development of this technology, with human cognition viewed as a baseline. This view neglects the fact that humans are social animals and that much of our intelligence is social and cultural in origin. Moreover, failing to properly situate aspects of intelligence at the social level contributes to the treatment of the societal consequences of technology as an afterthought. The path forward is not merely more data and compute, and not merely more attention paid to cognitive or symbolic representations, but a thorough blending of economic and social concepts with computational and inferential concepts at the level of algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Through the River: Understanding the Benefit of Schedule-Free Methods for Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09846v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024], which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization with Cross-Entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-source learning with discrete labels, distributional heterogeneity across domains poses a central challenge to developing predictive models that transfer reliably to unseen domains. We study multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation, where labeled data are available from multiple source domains and only unlabeled data are observed from the target domain. To address potential distribution shifts, we propose a novel Conditional Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (CG-DRO) framework that learns a classifier by minimizing the worst-case cross-entropy loss over the convex combinations of the conditional outcome distributions from sources domains. We develop an efficient Mirror Prox algorithm for solving the minimax problem and employ a double machine learning procedure to estimate the risk function, ensuring that errors in nuisance estimation contribute only at higher-order rates. We establish fast statistical convergence rates for the empirical CG-DRO estimator by constructing two surrogate minimax optimization problems that serve as theoretical bridges. A distinguishing challenge for CG-DRO is the emergence of nonstandard asymptotics: the empirical CG-DRO estimator may fail to converge to a standard limiting distribution due to boundary effects and system instability. To address this, we introduce a perturbation-based inference procedure that enables uniformly valid inference, including confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures dominate modern NLP but often demand heavy computational resources and intricate hyperparameter tuning. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel framework, BoostTransformer, that augments transformers with boosting principles through subgrid token selection and importance-weighted sampling. Our method incorporates a least square boosting objective directly into the transformer pipeline, enabling more efficient training and improved performance. Across multiple fine-grained text classification benchmarks, BoostTransformer demonstrates both faster convergence and higher accuracy, surpassing standard transformers while minimizing architectural search overhead.</description>

      <title>Sampling by averaging: A multiscale approach to score estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex, unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics. Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework: MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff, based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics. Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and efficiency, without the need for learned models.</description>

      <title>Functional Scaling Laws in Kernel Regression: Loss Dynamics and Learning Rate Schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws have emerged as a unifying lens for understanding and guiding the training of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies predominantly focus on the final-step loss, leaving open whether the entire loss dynamics obey similar laws and, crucially, how the learning rate schedule (LRS) shapes them. We address these gaps in a controlled theoretical setting by analyzing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a power-law kernel regression model. The key insight is a novel intrinsic-time viewpoint, which captures the training progress more faithfully than iteration count. We then establish a Functional Scaling Law (FSL) that captures the full loss trajectory under arbitrary LRSs, with the schedule's influence entering through a simple convolutional functional. We further instantiate the theory for three representative LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- and derive explicit scaling relations in both data- and compute-limited regimes. These comparisons explain key empirical phenomena: (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning-rate decay improves training efficiency; and (iii) WSD-type schedules outperform pure decay. Finally, experiments on LLMs ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters demonstrate the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting and predicting loss trajectories in large-scale pre-training.</description>

      <title>What Makes Looped Transformers Perform Better Than Non-Recursive Ones (Provably)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep). Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley. Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable performances.</description>

      <title>KVCOMM: Online Cross-context KV-cache Communication for Efficient LLM-based Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.</description>

      <title>ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard for aligning models with human feedback, yet its reliance on hard, pairwise preferences makes it brittle to annotator noise and distribution shift. We propose Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a generalized framework that learns from soft, listwise supervision by anchoring policy updates to a reference model. Our key theoretical contribution is to show that this anchoring mechanism imposes an implicit trust region on the policy update, enforced by the softmax Fisher information metric. This provides a robust geometric interpretation for both fixed and dynamic anchor strategies. Our central empirical finding is a task-dependent tradeoff between anchor update strategies. Through controlled experiments across twelve scenarios and two MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that (1) for online exploration in noisy environments, a dynamic anchor that tracks the learning policy is superior, improving performance by 5 to 11 percent over a fixed anchor; and (2) for offline distillation, a fixed anchor pointing to the teacher policy is dramatically more effective, achieving returns of 206.7 on HalfCheetah-v5 (387 percent of teacher) and 65.4 on Hopper-v5 (61 percent of teacher), while reducing KL divergence to the teacher by up to 5000 times compared with standard knowledge distillation. These findings offer clear, practical guidance for selecting anchor strategies and establish ADPO as a robust, unified framework for preference learning. Larger models further amplify ADPO's benefits (0.718 vs. 0.416 at hidden dimension 256), suggesting that anchoring acts as an effective trust-region regularizer. We release code and configurations to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Amortized Active Generation of Pareto Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation.</description>

      <title>A Free Probabilistic Framework for Denoising Diffusion Models: Entropy, Transport, and Reverse Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous probabilistic framework that extends denoising diffusion models to the setting of noncommutative random variables. Building on Voiculescu's theory of free entropy and free Fisher information, we formulate diffusion and reverse processes governed by operator-valued stochastic dynamics whose spectral measures evolve by additive convolution. Using tools from free stochastic analysis -- including a Malliavin calculus and a Clark--Ocone representation -- we derive the reverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the conjugate variable, the analogue of the classical score function. The resulting dynamics admit a gradient-flow structure in the noncommutative Wasserstein space, establishing an information-geometric link between entropy production, transport, and deconvolution. We further construct a variational scheme analogous to the Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto (JKO) formulation and prove convergence toward the semicircular equilibrium. The framework provides functional inequalities (free logarithmic Sobolev, Talagrand, and HWI) that quantify entropy dissipation and Wasserstein contraction. These results unify diffusion-based generative modeling with the geometry of operator-valued information, offering a mathematical foundation for generative learning on structured and high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Towards Personalized Treatment Plan: Geometrical Model-Agnostic Approach to Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation) from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Optimal Point for Boundary Approximation}$ (OPBA), applies binary search to find decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point. Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of runtime, the OPBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints) counterfactual explanations.

      <title>Localized Kernel Projection Outlyingness: A Two-Stage Approach for Multi-Modal Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO) that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on 10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage architectures.</description>

      <title>Topic Analysis with Side Information: A Neural-Augmented LDA Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes, or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets, nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Sampler-based Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory, we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO. While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation. Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$ close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while Signum remains invariant.</description>
