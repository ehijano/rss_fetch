      <title>Positivity in the shadow of Hodge index theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking a compact K\"{a}hler manifold as playground, we explore the powerfulness of Hodge index theorem. A main object is the Lorentzian classes on a compact K\"{a}hler manifold, behind which the characterization via Lorentzian polynomials over the K\"{a}hler cone and hence the validity of Hodge index theorem. Along the exploration, we discover several applications in complex geometry that may be unexpected before. (1) For a Lefschetz type operator given by the complete intersection of nef classes, we give a complete characterization of its kernel face against the pseudo-effective cone. (2) We provide a new approach to Teissier's proportionality problem from the validity of hard Lefschetz property. This perspective enables us to establish the extremals for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality on a strictly Lorentzian class, and thus also characterize the most extremal case for a log-concavity sequence given by the intersection numbers of two nef classes. These Lorentzian classes include the fundamental classes of smooth projective varieties or compact K\"{a}hler manifolds as typical examples, hence our result extends Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson's and Fu-Xiao's results in respective settings to broader contexts, e.g. certain algebraic cycle classes given by reducible subvarieties. (3) Furthermore, we also strengthen the proportionality characterization by comparing various quantitative deficits and establishing stability estimates. Two quantitative sharper stability estimates with close relation with complex Monge--Amp\`{e}re equations and Newton-Okounkov bodies are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Torsion Index of Half-Spin Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The torsion index of split simple groups has been extensively studied, notably by Totaro, who calculated the torsion indexes of the spin groups and $E_{8}$ in [5] and [6], respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide upper bounds for the torsion index of half-spin groups, the only remaining case in the calculation of torsion indexes for split simple groups. We present general upper bounds for the torsion index of half-spin groups, showing that, except for certain exceptional cases, it is at most twice that of the corresponding spin groups. For these exceptional cases, the torsion index is bounded above by at most $2^3$ times that of the spin groups. Our results also reveal that in many cases, the torsion index of half-spin groups coincides with that of the spin groups.</description>

      <title>Motivic (Representation) Stability of Representation Varieties and Character Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of motivic representation stability that is an algebraic counterpart of the notion of representation stability. In the process, we also introduce the notion of motivic decomposition for varieties equipped with an action of a finite group $G$. This motivic decomposition decomposes the virtual class of the variety with respect to irreducible rational representations of $G$.
  We also formulate conjectures on motivic representation stability in the context of representation varieties and character stacks, and we verify the conjectures for groups whose virtual classes have been extensively studied.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Flop in Dimension One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we observe that the categorical structure of a flop occurs for some well-known non-commutative resolutions of a nodal curve. We describe the flop-flop spherical twists, and give a geometric interpretation in terms of Landau--Ginzburg models. The resolutions are all weakly crepant but not strongly crepant, and we formulate an intermediate condition that distinguishes the smaller ones.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay modules and the Bondal-Orlov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the known examples of derived categories of small resolutions arise as the derived category of the endormorphism algebra of tilting bundles or complexes. Given two resolutions connected by a flop, if the strict transform of a tilting bundle is again tilting, then the derived categories of the two resolutions are equivalent, thereby proving the Bondal-Orlov conjecture in this setup. Unfortunately, it is difficult to produce tilting bundles that are compatible with flops. In this article, we introduce the notion of CM-degree of locally-free sheaves on resolutions and use them to construct tilting generators. In particular, we show that if there exists a relative very ample line bundle on the resolution with CM degree equal to the dimension of the exceptional locus, then the generator bundles constructed by Van den Bergh and Toda-Uehara are also tilting bundles. The advantage of our approach is that the CM degree is preserved under strict transform. As a consequence we prove the Bondal-Orlov conjecture in certain cases of small resolutions.</description>

      <title>Connectedness of the boundaries of the strata of differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}(\mu)^{\circ}$ be a connected component of the projectivized stratum of differentials on smooth complex curves, where the zero and pole orders of the differentials are specified by $\mu$. When the complex dimension of $\mathcal{P}(\mu)^{\circ}$ is at least two, Dozier--Grushevsky--Lee, through explicit degeneration techniques, showed that the boundary of $\mathcal{P}(\mu)^{\circ}$ is connected in the multi-scale compactification constructed by Bainbridge--Chen--Gendron--Grushevsky--M\"oller.
  A natural question is whether the connectedness of the boundary of $\mathcal{P}(\mu)^{\circ}$ is determined by its intrinsic properties. In the case of meromorphic differentials, we provide a concise explanation that the boundary of $\mathcal{P}(\mu)^{\circ}$ is always connected in any complete algebraic compactification, based on the fact that the strata of meromorphic differentials are affine varieties. We also observe that the same result holds for linear subvarieties of meromorphic differentials, as well as for the strata of $k$-differentials with a pole of order at least $k$.
  In the case of holomorphic differentials, using properties of Teichm\"uller curves, we provide an alternative argument showing that the horizontal boundary of $\mathcal{P}(\mu)^{\circ}$ and every irreducible component of its vertical boundary intersect non-trivially in the multi-scale compactification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the geometric Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties over function fields. We show a closed subvariety contains Zariski dense sets of small points, if and only if, after modulo its stabilizer, it is a torsion translate of a constant variety. A new phenomenon is that a special subvariety may not have a Zariski dense set of points of height 0.</description>

      <title>Three results on holonomic D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this text, we illustrate the use of local methods in the theory of (irregular) holonomic D-modules. I. (The Euler characteristic of the de~Rham complex) We show the invariance of the global or local Euler characteristic of the de~Rham complex after localization and dual localization of a holonomic D-module along a hypersurface, as well as after tensoring with a rank one meromorphic connection with regular singularities. II. (Local generic vanishing theorems for holonomic D-modules) We prove that the natural morphism from the proper pushforward to the total pushforward of an algebraic holonomic D-module by an open inclusion is an isomorphism if we first twist the D-module structure by suitable closed algebraic differential forms. III. (Laplace transform of a Stokes-filtered constructible sheaf of exponential type) Motivated by the construction in [YZ24], we~propose a slightly different construction of the Laplace transform of a Stokes-perverse sheaf on the projective line and show directly that it corresponds to the Laplace transform of the corresponding holonomic D-module via the Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff-Deligne-Malgrange correspondence. This completes the presentation given in [Sab13, Chap. 7]}, where only the other direction of the Laplace transformation is analyzed. We~also compare our approach with the construction made previously in [YZ24].</description>

      <title>o-minimal geometry of higher Albanese manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a normal quasi-projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. We study its higher Albanese manifolds, introduced by Hain and Zucker, from the point of view of o-minimal geometry. We show that for each $s$ the higher Albanese manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ can be functorially endowed with a structure of an $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable complex manifold in such a way that the natural projections $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{s-1}(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable and the higher Albanese maps $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{an}, \operatorname{exp}}$-definable. Suppose that for some $s \ge 3$ the definable manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is definably biholomorphic to a quasi-projective variety. We show that in this case the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step, i.e. the maps $\operatorname{Alb}^r (X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{r-1}(X)$ are isomorphisms for $r\ge 3$. It follows that if $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is dominant for some $s \ge 3$, then the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step and the pro-unipotent completion of $\pi_1(X)$ is at most 2-step nilpotent. This confirms a special case of a conjecture by Campana on nilpotent fundamental groups of algebraic varieties. As another application, we prove the existence and quasi-projectivity of unipotent Shafarevich reductions.</description>

      <title>Counting $D_4$ singularities in the image of a wave front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula to count the number of $D_4$ singularities in a stable frontal perturbation of a corank $2$ wave front singularity $f\colon (\mathbb{C}^3,0) \to (\mathbb{C}^4,0)$ using Mond's method of stable perturbations of map germs. For a generic germ of corank $2$ wave front $f\colon (\mathbb{C}^3,S) \to (\mathbb{C}^4,0)$, the image of a stable deformation $f_t$ of $f$ exhibits $A_k$ singularities with $k \leq 4$, their transverse intersections and the aforementioned $D_4$ singularities for $0 &lt; |t| \ll 1$. By interpreting the image of $f_t$ as the discriminant (the image of the critical point set) of a smooth map germ $H_t\colon (\mathbb{C}^5,0) \to (\mathbb{C}^4,0)$, we define an algebra whose dimension over $\mathbb{C}$ is equal to the number of $D_4$ points in the image of $f_t$.</description>

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for computing a basis of homology of fibre products of elliptic surfaces over $\mathbb P^1$, along with the corresponding intersection product and period matrices. We use this data to investigate the Gamma conjecture for Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained in this manner. We find a formula that works for all operators of a list of 105 fibre products, as well as for fourth order operators of the Calabi-Yau database. This algorithm comes with a SageMath implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a collection of results involving Colmez's periods and the Colmez Conjecture. Using Colmez's theory of periods of CM abelian varieties, we propose a definition for the height of a partial CM-type and prove that the Colmez conjecture follows from an arithmetic period formula for surfaces. We give an explicit conjecture for the form of this period formula, which relates the height of special points on a Shimura surface with special values of $L$-functions. Further, we relate the heights of periods given by Colmez to arithmetic degree of Hermitian line bundles and thus give a formulation of Colmez's full conjecture in geometric terms.</description>

      <title>Nakai-Moishezon criteria and the toric Thomas-Yau conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Lagrangian sections $L$ contained in certain Calabi-Yau Lagrangian fibrations (mirrors of toric weak Fano manifolds). We prove that a form of the Thomas-Yau conjecture holds in this case: $L$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in this class if and only if a stability condition holds, in the sense of a slope inequality on objects in a set of exact triangles in the Fukaya-Seidel category. This agrees with general proposals by Li. We use the SYZ transform, the toric gamma theorem, and toric homological mirror symmetry in order to reduce the statement to one about supercritical deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections, known as the Nakai-Moishezon criterion. As an application, we prove that, on the mirror of a toric weak del Pezzo surface, if $L$ defines a Bridgeland stable object in the Fukaya-Seidel category in a natural sense, then it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in the class. The converse also holds in the example given by the blowup of the projective plane at a point. This is consistent with general conjectures due to Joyce. We discuss some generalisations, including a weaker analogue of our main result for general projective toric manifolds, and a similar obstruction, related to Lagrangian multi-sections, in a special case.</description>

Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact quantum group $\mathrm{G}$ and denote by $\mathrm{G}_W$ the isotropy subgroup of a linear subspace $W\le V$ regarded as a point in the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}(V)$. We show that the space of those $W\in \mathbb{G}(V)$ for which $\mathrm{G}_W$ acts trivially on $W$ (or $V$) is open in the Zariski topology of the Weil restriction $\mathrm{Res}_{\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{G}(V)$. More generally, this holds for the space of $W$ for which (a) the $\mathrm{G}_W$-action factors through its abelianization, or (b) the summands of the $\mathrm{G}_W$-representation on $W$ (or $V$) are otherwise dimensionally constrained.
  The results generalize analogous classical generic rigidity statements useful in establishing the triviality of the classical automorphism groups of random quantum graphs in the matrix algebra $M_n$, and can be put to similar use in fully non-commutative versions of those results (quantum graphs, quantum groups).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working in positive characteristic, we show how one can use information about the dimension of moduli spaces of rational curves on a Fano variety $X$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ to obtain strong estimates for the number of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$-points of bounded height on $X$. Building on work of Beheshti, Lehmann, Riedl and Tanimoto~\cite{BeheshtiLehmannRiedlTanimoto.dP}, we apply our strategy to del Pezzo surfaces of degree at most 5. In addition, we also treat the case of smooth cubic hypersurfaces and smooth intersections of two quadrics of dimension at least 3 by showing that the moduli spaces of rational curves of fixed degree are of the expected dimension. For large but fixed $q$, the bounds obtained come arbitrarily close to the linear growth predicted by the Batyrev--Manin conjecture.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of affine ADE Nakajima quiver varieties via collapsing fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a universal substitution formula that compares generating series of Euler characteristics of Nakajima quiver varieties associated with affine ADE diagrams at generic and at certain nongeneric stability conditions via a study of collapsing fibres in the associated variation of GIT map, unifying and generalising earlier results of the last two authors with N\'emethi and of Nakajima. As a special case, we compute generating series of Euler characteristics of noncommutative Quot schemes of Kleinian orbifolds. In type A and rank 1, we give a second, combinatorial proof of our substitution formula, using torus localisation and partition enumeration. This gives a combinatorial model of the fibers of the variation of GIT map, and also leads to relations between our results and the representation theory of the affine and finite Lie algebras in type A.</description>

Abstract: We derive a formula for reconstructing a generic complex canonical curve $C$ of genus 6 and 7 in terms of the theta hyperplanes of $C$. Hence, we get a generic inverse to the Torelli map, as well as a complete description of the Schottky locus in these genera. The computational part of the proof relies on a certified numerical argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any kind of network can be naturally represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG); additionally, activation functions can determine the reaction of each node of the network with respect to the signal(s) incoming. We study the characterization of the signal distribution in a network under the lens of tensor algebra. More specifically, we describe every activation function as tensor distributions with respect to the nodes, called \textit{activation tensors}. The distribution of the signal is encoded in the \textit{total tensor} of the network. We formally prove that the total tensor can be obtained by computing the \textit{Batthacharya-Mesner Product} (BMP), an $n$-ary operation for tensors of order $n$, on the set of the activation tensors properly ordered and processed via two basic operations, that we call \textit{blow} and \textit{forget}. Our theoretical framework can be validated through the related code developed in Python.</description>

      <title>Moduli of stable sheaves on quadric threefold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{2}$, there exists a Bayer--Lahoz--Macr{\`{\i}}--Stellari inducing Bridgeland stability condition $\sigma(\alpha)$ on a Kuznetsov component $\mathrm{Ku}(Q)$ of the smooth quadric threefold $Q$. We obtain the non-emptiness of the moduli space $M_{\sigma(\alpha)}([\mathcal{P}_{x}])$ of $\sigma(\alpha)$-semistable objects in $\mathrm{Ku}(Q)$ with the numerical class $[\mathcal{P}_{x}]$, where $\mathcal{P}_{x}\in \mathrm{Ku}(Q)$ is the projection sheaf of the skyscraper sheaf at a closed point $x\in Q$. We show that the moduli space $\overline{M}_{Q}(\mathbf{v})$ of Gieseker semistable sheaves with Chern character $\mathbf{v}=\mathrm{ch}(\mathcal{P}_{x})$ is smooth and irreducible of dimension four, and prove that the moduli space $M_{\sigma(\alpha)}([\mathcal{P}_{x}])$ is isomorphic to $\overline{M}_{Q}(\mathbf{v})$. As an application, we show that the quadric threefold $Q$ can be reinterpreted as a Brill--Noether locus in the Bridgeland moduli space $M_{\sigma(\alpha)}([\mathcal{P}_{x}])$. In the appendices, we show that the moduli space $M_{\sigma(\alpha)}([S])$ contains only one single point corresponding to the spinor bundle $S$ and give a Bridgeland moduli interpretation for the Hilbert scheme of lines in $Q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a moduli description of the ramified unitary local model of signature $(n-1,1)$ with arbitrary parahoric level structure, assuming the residue field has characteristic not equal to $2$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Smithling. Our approach involves writing down explicit equations for the special fiber and proving that they define a normal, Cohen-Macaulay scheme, which is also of independent interest. As applications, we obtain moduli descriptions for: (1) ramified unitary Pappas-Zhu local models with arbitrary parahoric level; (2) the irreducible components of their special fiber in the maximal parahoric case; (3) integral models of ramified unitary Shimura varieties with arbitrary (quasi-)parahoric level.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between quadratic Hodge classes on moduli spaces of pseudostable and stable curves given by the contraction morphism $\mathcal{T}.$ While Mumford relations do not hold in the pseudostable case, we show that one can express the (pullback via $\mathcal{T}$ of the) Chern classes of $\mathbb{E}\oplus \mathbb{E}^\vee$ solely in terms of descendants and strata classes. We organize the combinatorial structure of the pullback of products of two pseudostable $\lambda$ classes and obtain an explicit comparison of arbitrary pseudostable and stable quadratic Hodge integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study asymptotic directions in the tangent bundle of the moduli space ${\mathcal M}_g$ of curves of genus $g$, namely those tangent directions that are annihilated by the second fundamental form of the Torelli map. We give examples of asymptotic directions for any $g \geq 4$. We prove that if the rank $d$ of a tangent direction $\zeta \in H^1(T_C)$ (with respect to the infinitesimal deformation map) is less than the Clifford index of the curve $C$, then $\zeta$ is not asymptotic. If the rank of $\zeta$ is equal to the Clifford index of the curve, we give sufficient conditions ensuring that the infinitesimal deformation $\zeta$ is not asymptotic. Then we determine all asymptotic directions of rank 1 and we give an almost complete description of asymptotic directions of rank 2.</description>

      <title>Towards a characterization of toric hyperk\"{a}hler varieties among symplectic singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X, \omega)$ be a conical symplectic variety of dimension $2n$ which has a projective symplectic resolution. Assume that $X$ admits an effective Hamiltonian action of an $n$-dimensional algebraic torus $T^n$, compatible with the conical $\mathbf{C}^*$-action. A typical example of $X$ is a toric hyperkahler variety $Y(A,0)$.
  In this article, we prove that this property characterizes $Y(A,0)$ with $A$ unimodular. More precisely, if $(X, \omega)$ is such a conical symplectic variety, then there is a $T^n$-equivariant (complex analytic) isomorphism $\varphi: (X, \omega) \to (Y(A,0), \omega_{Y(A,0)})$ under which both moment maps are identified. Moreover $\varphi$ sends the center $0_X$ of $X$ to the center $0_{Y(A,0)}$ of $Y(A,0)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between L-equivalence and D-equivalence for K3 surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds. Building on Efimov's approach using Hodge theory, we prove that very general L-equivalent K3 surfaces are D-equivalent, leveraging the Derived Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces. Our main technical contribution is that two distinct lattice structures on an integral, irreducible Hodge structure are related by a rational endomorphism of the Hodge structure. We partially extend our results to hyperk\"ahler fourfolds and moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces.</description>

We explore the relationship between the integral closure of ideals and the Newton polyhedron. We introduce and characterize non-degenerate ideals, showing that their integral closure is generated by specific monomials related to the Newton polyhedron.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of blowups via Weyl chamber decompositions and actions on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of $X^n_s$, the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^n_\mathbb{C}$ at $s$ points in general position. We identify a set of subvarieties, which we call Weyl $r$-planes, that belong to an orbit for the action of the Weyl group on $r$-cycles. They satisfy the following properties: they appear as stable base locus of divisors; each Weyl $r$-plane is swept out by an $(n-r)$-moving curve class; moreover, if $s\ge n+3$, for any fixed $r$ all these curve classes belong to the same orbit for the Weyl action.
  For Mori dream spaces of type $X^n_s$, all such orbits are finite and they allow to reinterpret Mukai's description of the Mori chamber decomposition of the effective cone in terms of $(n-r)$-moving curve classes, unifying previous different approaches.
  If $X^n_s$ is not a Mori dream space, there are infinitely many Weyl $r$-planes. These yields the definition of the Weyl chamber decomposition of the pseudoeffective cone of divisors. We pose the question as to whether the nef chamber decomposition can be defined (in the negative part of $\overline{\mathrm{Eff}}(X^n_s)$) and, if this is the case, whether it coincides with the Weyl chamber decomposition. We conjecture that the answer is affirmative for $X^3_8$ and $X^5_9$.</description>

To do this we provide another description of the completion of an approximable triangulated category under a properness assumption.

      <title>Harish-Chandra pairs and affine algebraic group schemes in the Verlinde category, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Venkatesh extended the category equivalence between affine algebraic groups and Harish-Chandra pairs, which was proved by the author in the supersymmetric context, to the situation of the Verlinde category in positive characteristic. But the proof is incomplete at some basic point, the author thinks. Amending that we refine the result. Our construction of an affine algebraic group scheme from a Harish-Chandra pair, which uses functor points and formal group schemes, is more conceptual and simpler than the known ones of the existing literature. In the same situation we prove tensor product decomposition of commutative Hopf algebras not necessarily of finite type, which is new.</description>

      <title>A note on the moduli spaces of free algebras of rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a formulation of the moduli problem for rank-2 algebras over general base rings in functorial terms, providing presentations as presheaf quotients of affine schemes by group scheme actions.</description>

      <title>A picture of the irreducible components of $W^r_d(C)$ for a general $k$-gonal curve $C$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on results on Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory obtained by H. Larson we give a picture of the irreducible components of $W^r_d(C)$ for a general $k$-gonal curve of genus $g$. This picture starts from irreducible components of $W^r_d(C)$ restricted to an open subset of $Pic (C)$ satisfying Brill-Noether theory as in the case of a general curve of genus $g$. We obtain some degeneracy loci associated to a morphism of locally-free sheaves on them of the expected dimension. All the irreducible components of the schemes $W^r_d(C)$ are translates of their closures in $Pic (C)$. We complete the proof that the schemes $W^r_d(C)$ are generically smooth in case $C$ is a general $k$-gonal curve (claimed but not completely proved before). We obtain some results on the tangent spaces to the splitting degeneracy loci for an arbitrary $k$-gonal curve and we obtain some new smoothness results in case $C$ is a general $k$-gonal curve.</description>

      <title>Structure of Dubrovin-Zhang free energy functions and universal identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a structural theorem relating the higher genera free energy functions of the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchies to the Witten-Kontsevich free energy function of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. As an important application, for any given genus $g\geq 1$, we construct a set of universal identities valid for the free energy functions of any Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy. In particular, we present some techniques that can be used to derive universal identities without relying on the geometry of the moduli space of stable curves of higher genus.</description>

      <title>The "Galois Correspondence" for n-Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an essential surjective Galois-correspondence-like functor for $n$-stacks. More specifically, it gives an essentially surjective functor from the $\infty$-category of $n$-stacks of finite sets with an action of the fundamental group of $X$ to the $\infty$-category of Deligne-Mumford $n$-stacks finite \'etale over a connected scheme $X$.</description>

      <title>Degenerate and irregular topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>
