      <title>Boron Nitride Coatings for the Enhanced Detection of Neutrons in CR-39</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron detection efficiency of Columbia Resin 39 (CR-39) nuclear track detectors was assessed for AmBe, 252Cf, and D-T (14 MeV) neutron source spectra. A boron nitride (BN) coating for CR-39 was developed to enhance the neutron detection efficiency by converting neutrons into energetic alpha particles through the well-known 10B(n,a)7Li reaction. Separate partially coated CR-39 pieces were exposed to each neutron source and subsequently analyzed under optical microscope and through large-area Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging over the irradiated area. The detection efficiency (tracks per neutron) was evaluated for each source spectra under optical and scanning electron microscopes and with or without BN coating. This resulted in a comprehensive guide to neutron detection with various sources using CR-39.</description>

      <title>Bayesian approach for spatial super-resolution of heterodyne wind lidars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21288v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind speed measurements using heterodyne lidars are limited in spatial resolution because of the current signal processing methods. This limit is equal to c $\tau$ ( c is the speed of light and $\tau$ is the laser pulse duration) corresponding to the length of the atmosphere contributing to the wind speed measurement at one distance. To go beyond this limit, we use an inverse problem approach based on a model of the spectrogram (concatenation of periodograms of each range) and prior distributions on our unknowns: backscattering amplitude and wind speed at each range. We apply our inversion method to simulated and experimental spectrograms, demonstrating a gain in resolution by a factor of 2 to 2.5 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Picosecond Precision Heavy Ion Detector for {\Lambda} hypernuclei lifetimes studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and preliminary performance evaluation of a new heavy ion detector for direct measurements of heavy {\Lambda} hypernuclei lifetimes. The detector employs the previously developed 10 picosecond resolution Radio Frequency (RF) Timer, which converts the temporal information of incident particles into spatial coordinates of secondary or photoelectrons on a position-sensitive detector by means of circular RF scanning in the 500-1000 MHz range. Here, we report the detector design to achieve efficient suppression of accidental background and effective separation of prompt reaction products and delayed events from {\Lambda} hypernuclei decays, results of test studies carried out with RF synchronized laser as well as preliminary results obtained by using alpha particles. Dedicated Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed to estimate the detector's performance under realistic experimental conditions at RF-driven electron, photon, or proton beams. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed design and provide a basis for upcoming experimental measurements, based on the delayed fission detection.</description>

      <title>TES Proton Irradiation Result Analysis for Future Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As observed on the signal of the Planck-HFI highly sensitive bolometers, the effect of cosmic rays on detectors is a major concern for future similar space missions. Their instruments will have a larger detection surface, increased sensitivity, and more stringent requirements on the suppression of systematic effects. To study the impact of cosmic rays on detector prototypes in operational conditions, IAS has designed a state-of-the-art cryogenic system to irradiate particles by coupling this facility to particle accelerators. An irradiation campaign has been carried out on LiteBIRD-HFT TES prototypes to study their response to particle hits. In this article, we present the results and the analysis of this first test campaign.</description>

      <title>Efficient Water-Cooled Bitter-Type Electromagnet for Zeeman Slowing in Cold-Atom Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the design, construction, and characterization of a Bitter-type electromagnet that produces a spatially-dependent magnetic field used for Zeeman slowing in cold-atom experiments. The coil consists of stacked copper arcs separated by PTFE spacers of varying thicknesses, generating a near-optimal field profile using a single power supply. With an electrical resistance of $26.5(3)$~m$\Omega$ and self-inductance of $19.1(1)$~$\mu$H, our design achieves a fast electrical switching time of $\tau \approx 180$~$\mu$s in a compact, 30-cm-long package. Water circulating helically through holes in the copper and channels in the spacers ensures efficient thermal management, limiting the temperature rise to $\sim 5^\circ$~C over $36$~s of continuous operation at $200$~A.</description>

      <title>Constraints on ultra-heavy dark matter from the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a search for ultra-heavy dark matter (UHDM) with the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL). Using a Monte Carlo framework that incorporates Earth shielding effects, we simulated UHDM propagation and energy deposition in p-type point-contact germanium detectors ($p$PCGe). Analysis of 205.4 kg$\cdot$day exposure in the 0.16-4.16 keVee range showed no excess above background. Our results exclude the spin-independent UHDM-nucleon scattering with two cross section scales, with the UHDM mass from $10^6$ GeV to $10^{11}$ GeV, and provide the most stringent constraints with solid-state detectors below $10^8$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Neutron source-based event reconstruction algorithm in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed an event reconstruction algorithm, applicable to large liquid scintillator detectors, built primarily upon neutron calibration data. We employ a likelihood method using photon detection time and charge information from individual photomultiplier tubes. Detector response tables in the likelihood function were derived from americium-carbon neutron source events, 2.2~MeV $\gamma$-ray events from cosmic-ray muon spallation neutrons, and laser calibration events. This algorithm can reconstruct the event position, energy, and also has capability to differentiate particle types for events within the energy range of reactor neutrinos. Using the detector simulation of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment as a large liquid scintillator detector example, we demonstrate that the presented reconstruction algorithm has a reconstructed position accuracy within $\pm$4~cm, and a reconstructed energy non-uniformity under 0.5\% throughout the central detector volume. The vertex resolution for positron events at 1~MeV is estimated to be around 9~cm, and the energy resolution is confirmed to be comparable to that in the JUNO official publication. Furthermore, the algorithm can eliminate 80\% (45\%) of $\alpha$-particle (fast-neutron) events while maintaining a positron event selection efficiency of approximately 99\%.</description>

      <title>Molecular structure, electric property, and scintillation and quenching of liquid scintillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid scintillators are widely used in particle and nuclear physics. Understanding the scintillation and quenching mechanisms is a fundamental issue in designing a high-light-yield liquid scintillator. In this work, the basic scintillation process for two-component liquid scintillators is reviewed, highlighting the processes of excitation, ionization, anion-cation recombination, and electric dipole-dipole energy transfer. A molecule's polar group, polarization characteristics, and the corresponding material's dielectric constant are found to be correlated with a liquid scintillator's scintillation efficiency. Polar groups and high relative dielectric constant (permittivity) can cause severe quenching and should be avoided. The tellurium loading scheme in the liquid scintillator of the SNO+ experiment, TeBD, is discussed. The hydroxyl groups introduce polar structures in the TeBD, and the relative dielectric constant of our reproduced sample is measured to be $17\pm2$. These discussions explain part of the quenching of the TeBD liquid scintillator.</description>

      <title>Photon reconstruction using the Hough transform in imaging calorimeters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon reconstruction in calorimeters represents a crucial challenge in particle physics experiments, especially in high-density environments where shower overlapping probabilities become significant. We present an energy-core-based photon reconstruction method. It is achieved through extending the application of the Hough transform to exploit the energy-core structure of photon showers. The method, validated through simulations of the CEPC crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, demonstrates outstanding performance. It achieves a reconstruction efficiency of nearly 100% for photons with energies exceeding 2 GeV and a separation efficiency approaching 100% for two 5 GeV photons, when the distance between them reaches the granularity limit of the calorimeter. This energy-core-based photon reconstruction method, integrated with an energy splitting technique, enhances the performance of photon measurement and provides a promising tool for imaging calorimeters, particularly those requiring high precision in photon detection in complex event topologies with high multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Ionization quenching factors and W-values of low-energy H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions in Ar gas at low pressure measured with a bulk resistive MICROMEGAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ionization quenching factor, the fraction of an ion's initial kinetic energy lost through ionization in a medium, was measured for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions within the 2.5-5 keV energy range in an Ar/CO$_2$ gas mixture at pressures between 75 and 150 mbar. The mixture was contained in the active volume of a MICROMEGAS type Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD), which was connected to an ion source via a high vacuum system. The results showed a significant decrease in ionization as the ion energy decreased, although no dependence on gas pressure was observed within the low pressure range studied. Additionally, significant deviations from the predictions of SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) simulations were found. These measurements also allowed the first determination of $W$ values (the average energy required to create an electron-ion pair in the gas) for H$_2^+$ and He$^+$ ions in Ar at this particular energy range, which had not been previously explored for these projectile-target combinations. These findings are essential for accurate ion energy reconstruction in low-pressure MPGDs, with particular relevance for space-based energetic neutral atom detection, as proposed by the Italian Space Agency's SWEATERS project.</description>

      <title>Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monochromators are an essential component in electron microscopy and spectroscopy for enhancing the spatial and energy resolution. However, its adoption in scanning electron microscopes remains limited because of its high cost and operational complexity. Through a thin-deflector analysis of an electrostatic homogeneous-field deflector, the extreme sensitivity of current monochromators to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections is demonstrated. These stringent alignment requirements for achieving optimal energy resolution often necessitate the use of additional correcting elements, adding to both cost and complexity. We demonstrate that the fringe-field deflector is instead less sensitive to these issues. Hence, a cost effective and simple monochromator design approach based on pure fringe fields is proposed. This monochromator does not need extra correcting elements and its optimal energy resolution is achieved by including momentary deceleration lenses surrounding the main deflector. This fully electrostatic design could be realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies.</description>

      <title>Feed-forward active magnetic shielding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields from the brain are tiny relative to ambient fields which therefore need to be suppressed. The common solution of passive shielding is expensive, bulky and insufficiently effective, thus motivating research into the alternative of active shielding which comes in two flavours: feed-back and feed-forward. In feed-back designs (the most common), corrective fields are created by coils driven from sensors within the area that they correct, for example from the main sensors of an MEG device. In feed-forward designs (less common), corrective fields are driven from dedicated reference sensors outside the area they correct. Feed-forward can achieve better performance than feed-back, in principle, however its implementation is hobbled by an unavoidable coupling between coils and reference sensors, which reduces the effectiveness of the shielding and may affect stability, complicating the design. This paper suggests a solution that relies on a ``decoupling matrix," inserted in the signal pathway between sensors and corrective coils, to counteract the spurious coupling. This allows feed-forward shielding do reduce the ambient field to zero across the full frequency range, in principle, although performance may be limited by other factors such as current noise. The solution, which is fully data-driven and does not require geometric calculations, high-tolerance fabrication, or physical calibration, has been evaluated by simulation, but not implemented in hardware. It might contribute to the deployment of a new generation of measurement systems based on optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM). The lower cost and reduced constraints of those systems are a strong incentive to likewise reduce the cost and constraints of the shielding required to operate them, hence the appeal of active shielding.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensitivity to trace $^{238}$U impurity of sapphire via coincidence neutron activation analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sapphire has mechanical and electrical properties that are advantageous for the construction of internal components of radiation detectors such as time projection chambers and bolometers. However, it has proved difficult to assess its $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm ^{238}U$ content down to the picogram per gram level. This work reports an experimental verification of a computational study that demonstrates $\gamma\gamma$ coincidence counting, coupled with neutron activation analysis (NAA), can reach ppt sensitivities. Combining results from $\gamma\gamma$ coincidence counting with those of earlier single-$\gamma$ counting based NAA shows that a sample of Saint Gobain sapphire has $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm ^{238}U$ concentrations of $&lt;0.26$ ppt and $&lt;2.3$ ppt, respectively; the best constraints on the radiopurity of sapphire.</description>
