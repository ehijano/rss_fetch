      <title>Simulation of Ge on Si Photodiode with photon-trapping micro-nano holes with -3dB bandwidth of &gt;60 GHz at NIR wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study proposes an ultra-thin back side illuminated (BSI) and top-illuminated, Ge on Si photodetector (PD), for 1 to 1.4 microns wavelength range. The Ge thickness of 350 nm allows us to achieve high-speed performance at &gt;60 GHz, while the nanostructure at the bottom of the Ge layer helps to increase the optical absorption efficiency to above 80%. The BSI PD allows the PD or PD array wafer to be stacked with an electronic wafer for signal processing and transmission for optical interconnect applications such as short-reach links in data centers. Nano-microhole parameters in randomized composite formation on the bottom layer are optimized with Monte-Carlo molecular dynamics simulations incorporating charge transport to enable wide-spectral, highly efficient, and ultra-fast PDs.</description>

      <title>Beam Steering by Two Vertically Faced Metasurfaces Using Polarization-Free Unit Cells with Three Operating Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are valuable tools for enhancing the intelligence of the propagation environment. They have the ability to direct EM Waves to a specific user through beamforming. A significant number of passive elements are integrated into metasurfaces, allowing for their incorporation onto various surfaces such as walls and buildings. In certain situations, metasurfaces may need to be installed on surfaces that are not flat, such as surfaces with curves or surfaces with two sides. In this work, a unit cell with three polarization modes, consisting of absorption, reflection, and a 1-bit phase shift, is designed and investigated. The unit cell in the nonplanar metasurface is composed of two vertical surfaces. A mathematical model is used to analyze two vertically-faced metasurfaces. The results include S parameter values and full structure. It is demonstrated that both absorption reflection mode and phase shift mode are achieved within a specific frequency band. The simulations demonstrate that an appropriate absorption level, reaching -10 dB, is achieved in absorption mode. In reflection mode, a 180-degree phase shift is achieved within the same frequency band. Reports on the radiation pattern of two vertically faced structures indicate that there is no quantized beam when there is a one-bit phase shift.</description>

      <title>Single-antenna 3D localization with nonseparable toroidal pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental principle of satellite/node-based localization involves triangulating the receiver's localization by measuring distances between three or more known satellite/node localizations and receivers. Achieving accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization in free space based on a single transmission antenna remains a challenge requiring breakthroughs in principle. Here, we present such single-antenna 3D localization by applying a novel kind of topologically structured pulses, toroidal electromagnetic pulses, as information carriers. Excited by the recent compact generator of toroidal pulses and their sophisticated topological and nonseparable structures, we show that the space-time nonseparability and skyrmion topology of toroidal pulses can be utilized to achieve microwave 3D localization with super-resolution accuracy and experimentally validate its superior efficacy than the conventional triangulating microwave localization. This work opens up new avenues for exploring the potential applications of topological electromagnetic pulses including but not limited to positioning, imaging, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Understanding two-dimensional tractor magnets: theory and realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative investigation of two-dimensional tractor magnet configurations, analyzing both theoretical predictions and experimental results with a focus on the minimal tractor magnet. The minimal tractor magnet consists of a rigid assembly of one attracting magnet (attractor), two repelling magnets (repulsors), and a fourth magnet (follower) that is magnetically stabilized in a local energy minimum. The theoretical framework relies on magnetostatics and stability analysis of stationary equilibria. To calculate the magnetostatic force and energy, we use a multipole method. In a first approximation, we derive analytical results from the point dipole approximation. The point dipole analysis defines an upper bound criterion for the magnetic moment ratio and provides analytical expressions for stability bounds in relation to geometry parameters. Our experimental results are consistent with the predictions from the fourth-order multipole expansion. Beyond the minimal tractor magnet, we introduce a more advanced configuration that allows for a higher magnetic binding energy and follower capture at larger distances.</description>

Abstract: Metasurfaces are sub-wavelength patterned layers for controlling waves in physical systems. In optics, meta-surfaces are created by materials with different dielectric constants and are capable of unconventional functionalities. We develop a deep-learning framework for Dirac-material metasurface design for controlling electronic waves. The metasurface is a configuration of circular graphene quantum dots, each created by an electric potential. Employing deep convolutional neural networks, we show that the original scattering wave can be reconstructed with fidelity over 95$\%$, suggesting the feasibility of Dirac electron holography. Additional applications such as plane wave generation, designing broadband, and multi-functionality graphene metasurface systems are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity in transmission mode with planar structures for arbitrarily polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approaching thermodynamic limits in light harvesting requires enabling nonreciprocal thermal emission. The majority of previously reported nonreciprocal thermal emitters operate in reflection mode, following original proposals by M. Green and others. In these proposals, cascaded nonreciprocal junctions that re-direct each junction's emission towards a subsequent one are employed for efficient light-harvesting. Recently, simplified concepts have been proposed in solar photovoltaics and thermophotovoltaics that leverage the concept of tandem junctions to approach thermodynamic limits. In these simplified scenarios, polarization-independent nonreciprocal response in transmission mode is required. We propose a pattern-free heterostructure that enables such functionality, using a magneto-optical material embedded between two dissimilar dielectric layers.</description>

Abstract: We apply in simulation a reservoir computer based on evanescently coupled GaAs microrings for real-time compensation of a nonlinear distortion of a 50 Gbaud 16-QAM signal with the launch power up to 12 dBm in a standard single-mode optical fibre. We clearly evidence the crucial role of fast nonlinear response in enabling all-optical signal recovery in real time. With our system we are able to reduce the signal error rate below the forward error correction limit for a 20 km fibre and 12 dBm launch power.</description>

      <title>Robust field-free switching using large unconventional spin-orbit torque in an all-van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging all-van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin-orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out-of-plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all-vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field-free switching against external magnetic field hasn't been examined, which hinder further applications. Here we demonstrate the field-free switching in an all-vdW heterostructure combining a type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field-free switching can be achieved at 2.56 x 10^10 A per m2 at 300K and a large SOT efficiency of the out-of-plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, we find that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in-plane magnetic field reaches 252mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. Our work shows that all-vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT-based devices.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a graphene-hBN superlattice field effect transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a unique platform to naturally host a high quality 2D electron system. With hBN encapsulation to protect the graphene from the noisy environment, it has a potential to realize ultrahigh performance nanodevices, such as photodiodes and transistors. However, absence of a band gap at Dirac point poses challenges in using the system as a useful transistor. In this study, we investigate the functionality of a hBN-aligned monolayer graphene as a field effect transistor (FET). By precisely aligning the hBN and graphene, the band gaps open at the first Dirac point and at the hole-doped induced Dirac point via an interfacial moire potential. To characterize as a submicron scale FET, we fabricated a global bottom gate to tune the density of a conducting channel and a local top gate to switch-off the channel, demonstrating that this system can be tuned at an optimal on/off ratio regime by controlling the gates separately. These findings will present a useful reference point for further development of the FETs based on graphene heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid thin-film lithium niobate micro-ring acousto-optic modulator for microwave-to-optical conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly efficient acousto-optic modulation plays a vital role in the microwave-to-optical conversion. Herein, we demonstrate a hybrid thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) racetrack micro-ring acousto-optic modulator (AOM) implemented with low-loss chalcogenide (ChG) waveguide. By engineering the electrode configuration of the interdigital transducer, the double-arm micro-ring acousto-optic modulation is experimentally confirmed in nonsuspended ChG loaded TFLN waveguide platform. Varying the position of blue-detuned bias point, the half-wave-voltage-length product VpaiL of the hybrid TFLN micro-ring AOM is as small as 9 mVcm. Accordingly, the acousto-optic coupling strength is estimated to be 0.48 Hz s1/2 at acoustic frequency of 0.84 GHz. By analyzing the generation of phonon number from the piezoelectric transducer, the microwave-to-optical conversion efficiency is calculated to be 0.05%, approximately one order of magnitude larger than that of the state-of-the-art suspended counterpart. Efficient microwave-to-optical conversion thus provides new opportunities for low-power-consumption quantum information transduction using the TFLN-ChG hybrid piezo-optomechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast Digital DPC Yielding High Spatio-Temporal Resolution for Low-Dose Phase Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the scanning transmission electron microscope, both phase imaging of beam-sensitive materials and characterisation of a material's functional properties using in-situ experiments are becoming more widely available. As the practicable scan speed of 4D-STEM detectors improves, so too does the temporal resolution achievable for both differential phase contrast (DPC) and ptychography. However, the read-out burden of pixelated detectors, and the size of the gigabyte to terabyte sized data sets, remain a challenge for both temporal resolution and their practical adoption. In this work, we show that a high-fidelity DPC phase reconstruction can be achieved from both annular segmented detectors or pixelated arrays with relatively few elements using signal digitisation. Unlike conventional analog data, even at the fastest scan speeds, phase reconstructions from digitised DPC-segment images yield reliable data. Finally, dose fractionation by fast scanning and multi-framing allows for post-process binning of frame streams to balance signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for low-dose phase imaging for in-situ experiments.</description>

      <title>Autoresonant laser acceleration of electrons in a strongly magnetized plasma solenoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct laser acceleration of electrons is considered in a strongly magnetized plasmoid with the magnetic field strength allowing for reaching the auto-resonance. The plasmoid may be optically created by irradiation of specially designed targets with an auxiliary intense laser beam at the previous stage of interaction in a possible all-optical setup. Specifics of the strongly magnetized plasma solenoid may be critically important for the resonant processes where a small deviation of the parameters destroys the matching conditions. The process of the autoresonant electron acceleration is analyzed for different configurations inherent in the possible realizations of the setup, estimates for the efficiency of acceleration and resonance magnetic fields are proposed. Despite the modifications of the autoresonance conditions and the presence of collective effects, generation of energetic electron bunches in a realistic setup may be possible and effective.</description>

      <title>NO2 adsorption on GaN surface and its interaction with the yellow-luminescence-associated surface state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapping of charge at surface states is a longstanding problem in GaN that hinders a full realization of its potential as a semiconductor for microelectronics. At least part of this charge originates in molecules adsorbed on the GaN surface. Multiple studies have addressed the adsorption of different substances, but the role of adsorbents in the charge-trapping mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the GaN surface selectively adsorbs nitrogen dioxide (NO2) existing in the air in trace amounts. NO2 appears to charge the yellow-luminescence-related surface state. Mild heat treatment in vacuum removes this surface charge, only to be re-absorbed on re-exposure to air. Selective exposure of vacuum-annealed GaN to NO2 reproduces a similar surface charge distribution, as does the exposure to air. Residual gas analysis of the gases desorbed during heat treatment in vacuum shows a large concentration of nitric oxide (NO) released from the surface. These observations suggest that NO2 is selectively adsorbed from the air, deleteriously affecting the electrical properties of air-exposed GaN. The trapping of free electrons as part of the NO2chemisorption process changes the surface charge density, resulting in a change in the surface band bending. Uncontrollable by nature, NO2 adsorption may significantly affect any GaN-based electronic device. However, as shown here, a rather mild heat treatment in vacuum restores the surface state occupancy of GaN to its intrinsic state. If attempted before passivation, this heat treatment may provide a possible solution to longstanding stability problems associated with surface charge trapping in GaN-based devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics is living an era of unprecedented cross-fertilization among the different areas of science. In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that ultracold-atom quantum technologies can have in fundamental and applied science through platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. We take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e. creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum computer to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We convey three main messages. First, atomic quantum technologies have enabled a new way in which quantum technologies are used for fundamental science, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is taking the center stage in frontier's science. Third, quantum science progress will have capillary impact on society. Thus, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all these reflections, this perspective review is aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation.</description>

      <title>Dual-band bandpass filter derived from the transformation of a single-band bandpass filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of personal wireless communication devices is driving the need for multi-band frequency selective components including multiplexers and dual-band filters. This paper presents a simple technique for transforming a single-band bandpass filter (BPF) into a dual-band BPF. A second order (two-pole) single-band bandpass filter was chosen for this research, giving rise to a fourth order (four-pole) dual-band bandpass filter after the proposed filter transformation. Both filters were then implemented using the compact U-shaped microstrip resonator for improved device miniaturization. The proposed work features a centre frequency of 1.4 GHz for the single-band bandpass filter, with a span of 3.4% fractional bandwidth. The dual-band bandpass filter operates at 1.35 and 1.45 GHz. The design implementation employs the commercially available Rogers RT/Duroid 6010LM substrate, having a dissipation factor of 0.0023, dielectric constant of 10.7, diel thickness (h) of 1.27 mm, and top/bottom cladding of 35 microns. The results reported for the theoretical and practical designs show good agreement and improved performance when compared to similar research works in literature. The practical responses of the prototype dual-band BPF indicate a good return loss of better than 18 dB across both bands, and an insertion loss of better than 0.1 dB.</description>

      <title>A Nanocryotron Ripple Counter Integrated with a Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector for Megapixel Arrays</title>

Abstract: Decreasing the number of cables that bring heat into the cryostat is a critical issue for all cryoelectronic devices. Especially, arrays of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) could require more than $10^6$ readout lines. Performing signal processing operations at low temperatures could be a solution. Nanocryotrons, superconducting nanowire three-terminal devices, are good candidates for integrating sensing and electronics on the same technological platform as SNSPDs in photon-counting applications. In this work, we demonstrated that it is possible to read out, process, encode, and store the output of SNSPDs using exclusively superconducting nanowires. In particular, we present the design and development of a nanocryotron ripple counter that detects input voltage spikes and converts the number of pulses to an $N$-digit value. The counting base can be tuned from 2 to higher values, enabling higher maximum counts without enlarging the circuit. As a proof-of-principle, we first experimentally demonstrated the building block of the counter, an integer-$N$ frequency divider with $N$ ranging from 2 to 5. Then, we demonstrated photon-counting operations at 405\,nm and 1550\,nm by coupling an SNSPD with a 2-digit nanocryotron counter partially integrated on-chip. The 2-digit counter could operate in either base 2 or base 3 with a bit error rate lower than $2 \times 10^{-4}$ and a count rate of $10^7\,$s$^{-1}$. We simulated circuit architectures for integrated readout of the counter state, and we evaluated the capabilities of reading out an SNSPD megapixel array that would collect up to $10^{12}$ counts per second. The results of this work, combined with our recent publications on a nanocryotron shift register and logic gates, pave the way for the development of nanocryotron processors, from which multiple superconducting platforms may benefit.</description>

      <title>Mechanical intelligence via fully reconfigurable elastic neuromorphic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of mechanical systems to perform basic computations has gained traction over recent years, providing an unconventional alternative to digital computing in off grid, low power, and severe environments which render the majority of electronic components inoperable. However, much of the work in mechanical computing has focused on logic operations via quasi-static prescribed displacements in origami, bistable, and soft deformable matter. In here, we present a first attempt to describe the fundamental framework of an elastic neuromorphic metasurface that performs distinct classification tasks, providing a new set of challenges given the complex nature of elastic waves with respect to scattering and manipulation. Multiple layers of reconfigurable waveguides are phase-trained via constant weights and trainable activation functions in a manner that enables the resultant wave scattering at the readout location to focus on the correct class within the detection plane. We further demonstrate the neuromorphic system's reconfigurability in performing two distinct tasks, eliminating the need for costly remanufacturing.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale CMOS-compatible graphene Josephson field-effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrostatically tunable Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs) are one of the most desired building blocks of quantum electronics. JoFET applications range from parametric amplifiers and superconducting qubits to a variety of integrated superconducting circuits. Here, we report on graphene JoFET devices fabricated with wafer-scale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible processing based on wet transfer of chemical vapour deposited graphene, atomic-layer-deposited Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ gate oxide, and evaporated superconducting Ti/Al source, drain, and gate contacts. By optimizing the contact resistance down to $\sim$ 170 $\Omega \mu m$, we observe proximity-induced superconductivity in the JoFET channels with different gate lengths of 150 - 350 nm. The Josephson junction devices show reproducible critical current $I_{\text{C}}$ tunablity with the local top gate. Our JoFETs are in short diffusive limit with the $I_{\text{C}}$ reaching up to $\sim\,$3 $\mu A$ for a 50 $\mu m$ channel width. Overall, our demonstration of CMOS-compatible 2D-material-based JoFET fabrication process is an important step toward graphene-based integrated quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Damping Reveals Hidden Dimensions in Elastic Metastructures Through Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Damping typically results in attenuation of vibrations and elastic wave propagation in mechanical systems. Contrary to this conventional understanding, we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically the revival of an elastic wave transmitted through a periodic metastructure when a weak non-Hermitian defect (damping mechanism) induces violation of time-reversal symmetry. Damping alters the nature of the system's resonant modes, instigating interference in the scattering field. This leads to transmission revival, revealing the presence of hidden modes which are otherwise masked by the symmetry. Our findings offer an innovative approach for designing dissipation-driven switches and controllers and non-destructive structural health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Perfect nonradiating electromagnetic source and its self-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonradiating sources and anapoles are curious objects from the physics of invisibility that illuminate subtle concepts of fundamental electrodynamics and have promising applications in nanophotonics. The present work shows that a perfectly conducting sphere with a hidden magnetic field is a simple nonradiating electromagnetic source with mechanical excitation and complete internal confinement of electromagnetic energy. It does not require external electromagnetic excitation and is excited by rotation, which induces internal charges and currents with a self-compensating external radiation. The constructed source acts on itself through Lorentz forces emerging from the interaction of charges and currents with electromagnetic fields inside the sphere and, when having a freedom of rotation about the fixed center, exhibits regular precession like a gyroscope. This self-action reveals an internal electromagnetic activity of the perfect nonradiating source, externally inactive and invisible. Neutron stars, these nanospheres of space, can be such natural nonradiating sources when their magnetic fields are buried.</description>
