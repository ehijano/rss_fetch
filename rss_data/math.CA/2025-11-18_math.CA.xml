      <title>Transmutation operators for Schr\"odinger equations with distributional potentials and the associated impedance equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the construction of an integral transmutation operator for the Schr\"odinger equation
  \[
  -y'' + q(x)y = \lambda y, \quad x \in J, \ \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
  \] in the case where $q$ is the distributional derivative of an $L^2$ function on a bounded interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$. Such a transmutation operator transforms solutions of $ v'' + \lambda v = 0 $ into solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. The construction of the integral transmutation operator relies on a new regularization of the distributional Schr\"odinger equation based on the Polya factorization in terms of a solution $f$ that does not vanish on the closure of $J$. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a function $f$ are established, together with a method for its construction.
  As a consequence of the Polya factorization, we obtain an integro-differential transmutation operator for the associated Sturm--Liouville operator in impedance form related to $f$, along with smoothness conditions for the transmutation kernel. Furthermore, we introduce the Darboux transform for both the Schr\"odinger and impedance operators, and describe their relationships with the corresponding transmutation operators. Finally, we develop several series representations for the solutions, including the spectral parameter power series and the Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Besicovitch-Federer projection theorem for measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a Besicovitch-Federer type projection theorem for general measures. Specifically, let $\mu$ be a finite Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $0 &lt; m &lt; n$ be an integer. We show that, under the sole assumption that the slice $\mu \cap W$ is atomic for a typical $(n-m)$-plane $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, pure unrectifiability can be characterized simultaneously by the $\mu$-almost everywhere injectivity of the orthogonal projection $\pi_V \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to V$ and by the singularity of the projected measure for a typical $m$-plane $V$. In particular, no assumption on $\pi_V\mu$ is required a priori. This yields a new rectifiability criterion via slicing for Radon measures. The result is new even in the classical setting of Hausdorff measures, and it further extends to arbitrary locally compact metric spaces endowed with a generalized family of projections.</description>

      <title>On Tangential and Projectively Adjacent Approach Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1906 Fatou proved that bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disc converge a.e. on the boundary along nontangential approach regions. In 1927 Littlewood proved a negative result, i.e., that a.e. convergence fails for certain approach regions: More precisely, it fails for the rotationally invariant families of tangential approach regions that end curvilinearly at the boundary. The fact that tangential approach regions which end sequentially at the boundary may instead be very well conducive to a.e. convergence was understood more recently by W. Rudin (in 1979) and A. Nagel and E.M. Stein (in 1984), in contributions that provided additional and much needed insight, and that prompted the question of giving an a priori description of those families of tangential approach regions which end sequentially at the boundary and for which a.e. convergence fails. Our main result is the first one of this kind. Indeed, we prove the failure of a.e. convergence for a class of approach regions, introduced in this work, which we call projectively adjacent, that contains curvilinear approach regions as well as sequential ones. Our result recaptures the aforementioned theorem of Littlewood as well as some of the other theorems of that type, but its novelty lies in the fact that, while all previous negative results for tangential approach (Littlewood, 1927; Lohwater and Piranian, 1957; Aikawa, 1990-1991, and others) dealt with approach regions that either are curves or share with curves a certain topological property that excludes the possibility that they could end sequentially at the boundary, our negative result deals with a class of approach regions that contains both the curvilinear and the sequential ones. Hence we present a significant extension of the class of those families of approach regions for which a.e. convergence fails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $A$ is in the $p$-Schatten class on $\mathbb{R}^n$, $1\leq p \leq \frac{4n}{2n-1}$, then the quantum translates of $A$ are linearly independent. Moreover, there exists a non-zero operator in the $p$-Schatten class on $\mathbb{R}^n$, $p&gt;\frac{4n}{2n-1}$ whose quantum translates are linearly dependent.</description>

      <title>Sampling Density for Gabor Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gabor phase retrieval stands for recovering a square integrable function up to a global phase from absolute values of its Gabor transform. In this paper, we study Gabor phase retrieval from discrete samples. We consider three types of sampling sequences, which include square root lattices, square root sequences on two intersecting lines and on three parallel lines respectively. In all cases we give the optimal sampling density for a sequence to do Gabor phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Residue sums for superconformal indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superconformal indices of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry. The usual representation of the index involves a multi-dimensional contour integral over the BPS spectrum of the free gauge theory. To find a closed form expression for the index, it is natural to attempt a residue evaluation. However, the presence of a non-isolated essential singularity inside the contour prevents a straightforward implementation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by gauge-fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Macdonald index, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. The simplified form manifests the strongly coupled BPS spectrum of the Macdonald sector of the theory, and suggests the absence of ``non-graviton'' operators in this sector. We also evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Recurrence for fully degenerate Bell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the unnatural appearance of the two-variable degenerate Fubini polynomials in a recently derived Spivey-type recurrence relation for the fully degenerate Bell polynomials. To solve this, we introduce a new family of polynomial which we also call the fully degenerate Bell polynomials, along with their two-variable counterparts. Our main contribution is the derivation of natural Spivey-type recurrence relations using operator methods. We extend these results to the r-counterparts, the fully degenerate r-Bell polynomials providing Dobinski-like, finite sum, operator expressions, and Spivey-type recurrence relations for all the new polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Rellich-type asymptotics for eigenfunctions on rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_X$ in exterior domains $\Omega$ of rank-one Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type $X$, a class that includes all hyperbolic spaces. Extending the classical $L^2$-Rellich theorem for the Euclidean Laplacian, we investigate the asymptotic behavior and $L^p$-integrability of solutions to the Helmholtz equation
  \[
  \Delta_X f + (\lambda^2 + \rho^2) f = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega,
  \]
  where $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\setminus i\mathbb{Z}$ and $\rho$ is the half-sum of positive roots.
  We obtain sharp Rellich-type quantitative $L^p$-growth estimates of~$f$ in geodesic annuli, leading to the nonexistence of $L^p(\Omega)$-solutions for the optimal range $1 \leq p \leq 2$ and spectral parameters $\lambda$ satisfying $|Im(\lambda)| \leq (2/p - 1)\rho$. As a by-product of our study, we also establish a Rellich-type uniqueness theorem for eigenfunctions in terms of Hardy-type norms. Our results geometrically extend the Euclidean Rellich theorem, revealing how exponential volume growth and the dependence of the $L^p$-spectrum of $\Delta_X$ on $p$ give rise to genuinely non-Euclidean spectral phenomena.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Place n nodes on the unit circle and connect some pairs with springs that pull connected nodes toward each other. Which graphs always drive all nodes to converge to a single point, no matter where they start? This is known as the global synchronization problem of the Kuramoto model and is closely tied to the benign nonconvexity of its synchronization landscape. In this work, we show how this dynamical and continuous question can be reduced to a static and combinatorial one. We prove that threshold graphs, the graph class closed under adding isolated nodes and adding universal nodes, are globally synchronizing, based purely on a combinatorial analysis of unit-vector configurations in the plane. It is particularly striking that threshold graphs range from extremely sparse structures such as stars to the complete graph, suggesting that global synchronization in this class cannot be attributed to density. Our proof shows that global synchronization can instead emerge from a form of geometric symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any indeterminate Hamburger moment problem there exists an infinite family of analytic densities with finite (Shannon) entropy. This shows that the maximal entropy density g_{hmax} among the densities to the moment problem has finite entropy. The result is illustrated by the Al-Salam--Carlitz moment problem.</description>

      <title>A sharp commutator estimate for all Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a functional inequality in any dimension controlling the derivative along a transport of the Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the third author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where this control is an essential ingredient. Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp. In this paper, we obtain the optimal $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$ error, for all cases, including the sub-Coulomb case. Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.
  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium. In particular, we show here for $\mathsf{s}&lt;\mathsf{d}-2$ the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows. This complements the recent work arXiv:2407.15650 on the optimal rate for the (super-)Coulomb case $\mathsf{d}-2\le \mathsf{s}&lt;\mathsf{d}$ and therefore resolves the entire potential Riesz case.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of random walks on simple homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is a non-compact simple Lie group and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that the random walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure unless it is trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that the starting point may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  The main challenge is to show that the dimensional properties of a given probability distribution on $G/\Lambda$ improve under convolution by $\mu$. For this, we develop a new method, which combines a dimensional stability result and a dimensional increase alternative. This approach allows us to bypass inherent geometric obstructions. To show dimensional stability, we establish a general subcritical projection theorem under optimal non-concentration assumptions on the projector, and a corresponding submodular inequality in simple Lie algebras which allows its application to random walks. Both are of independent interest. The dimensional increase alternative aligns with the spirit of Bourgain's projection theorem. It is fine-tuned for random walks and has the advantage of being valid in situations lacking transversality.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of rare events in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding rare events is critical across domains ranging from signal processing to reliability and structural safety, extreme-weather forecasting, and insurance. The analysis of rare events is a computationally challenging problem, particularly in high dimensions $d$. In this work, we develop the first asymptotic high-dimensional theory of rare events. First, we exploit asymptotic integral methods recently developed by the first author to provide an asymptotic expansion of rare event probabilities. The expansion employs the geometry of the rare event boundary and the local behavior of the log probability density. Generically, the expansion is valid if $d^2\ll\lambda$, where $\lambda$ characterizes the extremity of the event. We prove this condition is necessary by constructing an example in which the first-order remainder is bounded above and below by $d^2/\lambda$. We also provide a nonasymptotic remainder bound which specifies the precise dependence of the remainder on $d$, $\lambda$, the density, and the boundary, and which shows that in certain cases, the condition $d^2\ll \lambda$ can be relaxed. As an application of the theory, we derive asymptotic approximations to rare probabilities under the standard Gaussian density in high dimensions. In the second part of our work, we provide an asymptotic approximation to densities conditional on rare events. This gives rise to simple procedure for approximately sampling conditionally on the rare event using independent Gaussian and exponential random variables.</description>

      <title>Convolution operators and variable Hardy spaces on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ be the Heisenberg group. For $0 \leq \alpha &lt; Q=2n+2$ and $N \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider exponent functions $p(\cdot) : \mathbb{H}^{n} \to (0, +\infty)$, which satisfies H\"older conditions, such that $\frac{Q}{Q+N} &lt; p_{-} \leq p(\cdot) \leq p_{+} &lt; \frac{Q}{\alpha}$. In this article we prove the $H^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{H}^{n}) \to L^{q(\cdot)}(\mathbb{H}^{n})$ and $H^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{H}^{n}) \to H^{q(\cdot)}(\mathbb{H}^{n})$ boundedness of convolution operators with kernels of type $(\alpha, N)$ on $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, where $\frac{1}{q(\cdot)} = \frac{1}{p(\cdot)} - \frac{\alpha}{Q}$. In particular, the Riesz potential on $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ satisfies such estimates.</description>

      <title>Notes on Regularity of Fourier integral operators with symbol in $S^{m}_{0,\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T_{a,\varphi}$ be a Fourier integral operator defined with $a\in S^{m}_{0,\delta}(0\leq\delta&lt;1)$ and $\varphi\in \Phi^{2}$ satisfying the strong non-degenerate condition. We demonstrate that when the order satisfies $$m\leq-\frac{n}{2}-\frac{n}{p}\delta+\frac{n}{p},$$ the operator $T_{a,\varphi}$ becomes bounded on $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $2&lt; p&lt;\infty$ and maps $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $BMO(\mathbb{R}^n)$ when $p=\infty$. Furthermore, the derived bound on $m$ is sharp for $L^{p}$ estimates in the case $\delta=0$, and for $(L^{\infty},BMO)$ when $0\leq\delta&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of complementary sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a positive, non-increasing sequence $a$ with finite sum equal to $1$, we consider the family of all closed subsets of $[0,1]$ whose complementary open intervals have lengths given by a rearrangement of the sequence $a$. We study the full range of possible $\theta$-intermediate dimensions of these sets and, under suitable assumptions on the sequence, we show that this range forms a closed interval, whose endpoints we compute explicitly. This paper fills a gap in the literature concerning the dimensional properties of complementary sets.</description>

      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Uniformly perfect measures on strictly convex planar graphs are $L^{2}$-flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniformly perfect measures are a common generalisation of Ahlfors regular measures, self-conformal measures on the line, and their push-forwards under sufficiently regular maps. We show that every uniformly perfect measure $\sigma$ on a strictly convex planar $C^{2}$-graph is $L^{2}$-flattening. That is, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists $p = p(\epsilon,\sigma) \geq 1$ such that $$\|\hat{\sigma}\|_{L^{p}(B(R))}^{p} \lesssim_{\epsilon,\sigma} R^{\epsilon}, \qquad R \geq 1.$$</description>

      <title>Cubic Oscillator: Geometric Approach and Zeros of Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a geometric approach to the cubic oscillator with three distinct turning points based on the $\mathcal{D\diagup SG}$\emph{\ correspondence }introduced in \cite{Thabet+al}. The existence of quantization conditions, depending on extra data for the potential, is related to some particular critical graphs of the quadratic differential $\lambda ^{2}\left(z-a\right) \left( z^{2}-1\right) dz^{2}$ where $\lambda$ is a non vanishing complex number, $a\in \mathbb{C}\diagdown \left\{ -1,1\right\}$. We investigate this geometric approach in two level: the first level is studying an inverse spectral problem related to cubic oscillator. The second level describes the zeros locations of eigenfunctions related to this oscillator. Our results may provide a geometric proof of some questions related to cubic potential case.</description>

      <title>Two-Scale Frostman Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a unified Frostman-type framework connecting the classical Hausdorff dimension with the family of intermediate dimensions $\dim_\theta$ recently introduced by Falconer, Fraser and Kempton. We define a new geometric quantity $\mathcal{D}(E)$ and prove that, under mild assumptions, there exists a family of measures $\{\mu_\delta\}$ supported on $E$ satisfying two simultaneous decay conditions, corresponding to the Hausdorff and intermediate Frostman inequalities. Such $(\delta, s, t)$-Frostman measures allow for a two-scale characterization of the dimension of $E$.</description>

      <title>The magnitude and spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's notion of magnitude for a smooth manifold with boundary of arbitrary dimension, motivated by open questions for the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For a large class of distance functions, including embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds satisfying a technical condition, we show that the magnitude function is well defined for $R\gg 0$ and admits a meromorphic continuation to sectors in $\mathbb{C}$. In the semiclassical limit $R \to \infty$, the magnitude function admits an asymptotic expansion, which determines the volume, surface area and integrals of generalized curvatures. Lower-order terms are computed by black box computer algebra. We initiate the study of magnitude analogues to classical questions in spectral geometry and prove an asymptotic variant of the Leinster-Willerton conjecture.</description>

      <title>Besov spaces and Schatten class Hankel operators for Hardy and Paley--Wiener spaces in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Schatten class membership of Hankel operators on Paley--Wiener spaces of convex $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, both for bounded and unbounded domains. In particular, the classical product Hardy spaces fit within our theory. For admissible domains, we develop a framework and theory of Besov spaces of Paley--Wiener type, and prove that a Hankel operator belongs to the Schatten class $S^p$ if and only if its symbol belongs to a corresponding Besov space, for $1 \leq p \leq 2$. We extend this result to all $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$ for the classical product Hardy spaces and to $1 \leq p &lt; 2(n+1)/(n-1)$ for the Paley--Wiener space of a bounded smooth domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of strictly positive curvature.</description>

      <title>On the best constants of Schur multipliers of higher order divided difference functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f \in C^n(\mathbb{R})$ be such that $\Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty &lt; \infty$. Let $f^{[n]} \in C(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ be the $n$th order divided difference. A special case of our main result states that for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ we have \[\Vert T_{f^{[n]}}: S_{np} \times \ldots \times S_{np} \rightarrow S_{p} \Vert \lesssim p^\ast p^n \Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty, \] where $p^\ast = p/(p-1)$ is the H\"older conjugate of $p$ and $T_{f^{[n]}}$ is the multilinear Schur multiplier with symbol $f^{[n]}$. In case of the generalized absolute value map $f(\lambda) = \lambda^{n-1} \vert \lambda \vert, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, we show that \[p^\ast p^{\min(2,n)} \lesssim \Vert T_{f^{[n]}}: S_{np} \times \ldots \times S_{np} \rightarrow S_{p} \Vert.\] This provides an alternative proof to one of the key theorems in the solution of Koplienko's problem on higher order spectral shift [Invent. Math. 193, No. 3, 501-538 (2013)], which is moreover sharp as $p \searrow 1$ (for any $n$) and as $p \to\infty$ (at least if $n = 1,2$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new estimates for the size and structure of the nodal set $\{u=0\}$ and the singular set $\{u=|\nabla u|=0\}$ of solutions $u$ to parabolic inequalities with parabolic Lipschitz coefficients. In particular, we show that almost all of the nodal and singular sets are covered by regular parabolic Lipschitz graphs with estimates, and that both sets satisfy parabolic Minkoswki estimates depending only on a doubling quantity at a point. Many of our results are new even for the heat equation on $\mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}$.</description>
