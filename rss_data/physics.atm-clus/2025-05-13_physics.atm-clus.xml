      <title>Observation of modulation-induced Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we observe a novel resonant mechanism, namely the modulation-induced Feshbach resonance. By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin excitations in a dual-core magnetic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic excitations are important quantum phenomena in magnetic systems and have been widely studied in individual magnetic atoms and molecules as well as their assembled structures over the past few decades. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the state-of-the-art ab initio wavefunction calculations, we investigated the properties of a novel dual-core Cr2Br6 molecule, which consists of two Cr ions coupled via superexchange through a single near-90{\deg} Cr-Br-Cr scissors bond. Under zero magnetic field, we observed a Fano peak with multi-steps through STS. When an external magnetic field is applied, some steps exhibit additional splitting, while others change little. We find that the Cr2Br6, exhibits a spin-degenerate ground state, and the complex peak splitting arises from the coexistence of vibrational and magnetic excitations in the molecule. Our results reveal rich quantum spin behavior in a well-defined two-core magnetic trihalide complex at the atomic scale, offering not only a minimal model for superexchange-coupled multi-spin quantum excitations but also a possible foundational unit for future molecule-based quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Investigations of electron removal processes in slow He$^{2+}$ and He$^{+}$-Ne$_2$ collisions indicate high Interatomic Coulombic Decay yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement an independent-atom and independent-electron model to investigate the collision systems of He$^{2+}$ and He$^{+}$ ion projectiles impinging on a neon dimer target. The dimer is set to be stationary at its equilibrium bond length with the projectile traveling parallel to the dimer axis at a speed corresponding to the collision energy of 10 keV/amu. Two approaches called multinomial and determinantal are used as an analysis of these collisions. Each of the analyses is broken down into two types of models that do not and do include a change in the projectile charge state due to electron capture from the dimer. All calculations are performed using both a frozen atomic target and a dynamic response model using the coupled-channel two-center basis generator method for orbital propagation. All one- and two- electron removal processes are calculated, though particular attention is paid to those that result in the Ne$^{+}$-Ne$^{+}$ fragmentation channel due to its association with interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD). We confirm in all analyses and models that Ne(2$s$) electron removal is strong so that ICD will contribute to dimer fragmentation as has been previously demonstrated. The model that takes into account the change in projectile charge state indicates that there is a pure ICD yield when utilizing a He$^{+}$ projectile.</description>
