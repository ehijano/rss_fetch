      <title>Making Cellular Networks Crisis-Proof: Towards Island-Ready, Resilient-By-Design 6G Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G and 5G-Advanced cellular networks are vulnerable to regional outages resulting from disasters or targeted attacks. This fragility stems from the reliance on the central core network involved for most 5G connectivity use cases. Crisis-struck regions isolated from the cellular core network form islands, where crisis response is hindered by the unavailability of recovery-relevant services, such as emergency calls, cell broadcasts, messengers, and news apps. Our concept of island-ready, resilient-by-design 6G communication networks envisions local cellular connectivity allowing users to connect to regional application servers, which is currently impossible. In our conceptualization, we follow an all-society approach, as realizing island connectivity requires the cooperation of multiple actors, including users, operators, developers, providers, and authorities. We evaluate how island-ready 5G and 5G-Advanced systems are and outline the open challenges stakeholders must address for full island readiness, such as decentralizing the 6G core network and designing local-first application architectures.</description>

      <title>Vision and Causal Learning Based Channel Estimation for THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of terahertz (THz) communications with massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems in 6G can potentially provide high data rates and low latency communications. However, accurate channel estimation in THz frequencies presents significant challenges due to factors such as high propagation losses, sensitivity to environmental obstructions, and strong atmospheric absorption. These challenges are par- ticularly pronounced in urban environments, where traditional channel estimation methods often fail to deliver reliable results, particularly in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. This paper introduces a novel vision-based channel estimation tech- nique that integrates causal reasoning into urban THz communi- cation systems. The proposed method combines computer vision algorithms with variational causal dynamics (VCD) to analyze real-time images of the urban environment, allowing for a deeper understanding of the physical factors that influence THz signal propagation. By capturing the complex, dynamic interactions between physical objects (such as buildings, trees, and vehicles) and the transmitted signals, the model can predict the channel with up to twice the accuracy of conventional methods. This model improves estimation accuracy and demonstrates supe- rior generalization performance. Hence, it can provide reliable predictions even in previously unseen urban environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is particularly evident in NLoS conditions, where it significantly outperforms traditional methods such as by accounting for indirect signal paths, such as reflections and diffractions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed vision-based approach surpasses conventional artificial intelligence (AI)-based estimation techniques in accuracy and robustness, showing a substantial improvement across various dynamic urban scenarios.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Heterogeneous Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks are expected to be heterogeneous systems, combining distinct qubit platforms, photon wavelengths, and device timescales to achieve scalable, multiuser connectivity. Building and iterating on such systems is costly and slow, motivating hardware-faithful simulations to explore architecture design space and justify implementation decisions. This paper presents a framework for simulating heterogeneous quantum networks based on SeQUeNCe, a discrete-event simulator of quantum networks. We introduce faithful device models for two representative platforms - Ytterbium atoms and superconducting qubits. On top of these models, we implement entanglement generation and entanglement swapping protocols for time-bin encoded photons that account for disparate clock rates and quantum frequency conversion and transducer losses/noise brought by the heterogeneity. Using extensive simulations, we map the rate-fidelity trade space and identify the dominant bottlenecks unique to heterogeneous systems. The models are open source and extensible, enabling reproducible evaluation of future heterogeneous designs and protocols.</description>

      <title>Timely Information for Strategic Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Caching for Efficient Image Generation in Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation employing diffusion models has attained significant popularity due to its capability to produce high-quality images that adhere to textual prompts. However, the integration of diffusion models faces critical challenges into resource-constrained mobile and edge environments because it requires multiple denoising steps from the original random noise. A practical way to speed up denoising is to initialize the process with a noised reference image that is similar to the target, since both images share similar layouts, structures, and details, allowing for fewer denoising steps. Based on this idea, we present CacheGenius, a hybrid image generation system in edge computing that accelerates generation by combining text-toimage and image-to-image workflows. It generates images from user text prompts using cached reference images. CacheGenius introduces a semantic-aware classified storage scheme and a request-scheduling algorithm that ensures semantic alignment between references and targets. To ensure sustained performance, it employs a cache maintenance policy that proactively evicts obsolete entries via correlation analysis. Evaluated in a distributed edge computing system, CacheGenius reduces generation latency by 41% and computational costs by 48% relative to baselines, while maintaining competitive evaluation metrics.</description>
