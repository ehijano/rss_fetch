      <title>Visible-Light Photocatalytic Degradation of Cresols using Sustainable 3D-Printed Bi4O5I2-Hematite Scaffold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photocatalysis, the reusability limit of catalysts can contribute to secondary pollution, posing ecological risks. Addressing this, the present study explores the integration of additive manufacturing with photocatalysis by decorating Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ onto a 3D-printed hematite scaffold (Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$@3DH) for the degradation of cresols. The 3D-printed hematite grid, fabricated via direct ink writing, exhibited excellent rheological behavior ($\tau\gamma = 24$ Pa), allowing precise shape retention. The sintered Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ was subsequently immobilized via a facile dip-coating method. Under optimized conditions, the composite achieved 99.78\% degradation of 20 mg/L p-cresol within 240 min of irradiation. Notably, hematite served as a porous substrate and contributed to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory simulations with Hubbard correction (DFT+U) indicated an interfacial charge transfer of approximately -0.9 electrons from hematite to Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$, confirming a S-scheme heterojunction between hematite and Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ semiconductors, validating experimental observations. The composite demonstrated strong performance across varied water matrices and in the presence of other cresol isomers. It also retained 84.28\% degradation efficiency after 10 cycles, with negligible catalyst leaching. Furthermore, in vitro and in silico ecotoxicity analyses revealed reduced toxicity of the degradation products. The current work presents a novel and scalable strategy, advancing the use of earth-abundant hematite minerals in sustainable environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Prediction of CO2 Solubility under Geological Conditions for CCUS via Improved Pitzer Parameters and Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solubility of CO2 in formation brines plays a critical role in the efficiency of carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations. It is strongly influenced by pressure, temperature, and brine composition. Various experimental studies and modeling approaches have been developed to estimate CO2 solubility under wide ranges of pressure, temperature, and salinities. This work makes three key contributions. First, we present an extensive literature review of experimental, theoretical, and simulation-based approaches for measuring and predicting CO2 solubility across a wide range of conditions and also a discussion of how the different parameters affect solubility. Second, we introduce an improved set of temperature-dependent Pitzer interaction parameters, yielding up to a 76% reduction in average absolute deviation compared to conventional values in the geochemical simulation software PHREEQC. Third, we develop a physics-informed machine learning model that integrates thermodynamic intuition with data-driven learning, achieving a 14% reduction in prediction error over the state-of-the-art and up to 40% improvement at high salinities. Together, these advances provide a robust and accurate framework for predicting CO2 solubility, supporting more reliable CCS design and deployment.</description>

      <title>Towards Routine Condensed Phase Simulations with Delta-Learned Coupled Cluster Accuracy: Application to Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating liquid water to an accuracy that matches its wealth of available experimental data requires both precise electronic structure methods and reliable sampling of nuclear (quantum) motion. This is challenging because applying the electronic structure method of choice - coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] - to condensed phase systems is currently limited by its computational cost and complexity. Recent tour-de-force efforts have demonstrated that this accuracy can indeed bring simulated liquid water into close agreement with experiment using machine learning potentials (MLPs). However, achieving this remains far from routine, requiring large datasets and significant computational cost. In this work, we introduce a practical approach that combines developments in MLPs with local correlation approximations to enable routine CCSD(T)-level simulations of liquid water. When combined with nuclear quantum effects, we achieve agreement to experiments for structural and transport properties. Crucially, this approach extends beyond constant volume to constant pressure simulations, allowing fundamental properties such as the density to now be predicted by MLP-based CCSD(T) models. Importantly, the approach also handles constant pressure simulations, enabling MLP-based CCSD(T) models to predict isothermal-isobaric bulk properties, such as water's density maximum in close agreement with experiment. Encompassing tests across electronic structure, datasets and MLP architecture, this work provides a practical blueprint towards routinely developing CCSD(T)-based MLPs for the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Gold-Standard Chemical Database 138 (GSCDB138): A diverse set of accurate energy differences for assessing and developing density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GSCDB138, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 138 data sets (8383 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spincontaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density-functional approximations shows the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall, yet reveals interesting exceptions: r2SCAN-D4 (meta-GGA) rivals hybrids for frequencies, and electric-field errors correlate poorly with ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the metaGGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment. GSCDB138 offers a comprehensive, openly documented platform for stringent DFA validation and for training the next generation of non-empirical and machine-learned functionals.</description>

      <title>Diffuse-Layer Capacitance at the Potential of Zero Charge in Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacitance of the electric double layer has potential applications in supercapacitors, and theoretical investigations of the double-layer capacitance in binary mixtures are important. In this work, we develop the theory of the electric double layer in binary mixtures, and the diffuse-layer capacitance at the potential of zero charge is obtained analytically. Furthermore, we observe a divergence of the capacitance in the phase diagram, suggesting a surface instability. The obtained capacitance is different from that derived using single-liquid approximation unless the preferential solvation energies of cations and anions are the same. When the system is close to the surface instability line, the capacitance strongly deviates from the results of single-liquid approximation.</description>

      <title>Statistical-Mechanical Theory on the Probability Distribution Function for the Net Charge of an Electrolyte Droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets of electrolyte solutions in an insulating medium are ubiquitous in nature. The net charges of these droplets are normally nonzero, and they fluctuate. However, a theory on the probability distribution function for the net charge of droplets is lacking, so far. Thus, a statistical-mechanical theory of a charged droplet is developed with including the effect of the electrostatic energy of charging as well as the random distribution of ions. Then, the probability distribution function for the net charge of an electrolyte droplet is calculated assuming that it is generated from a macroscopic solution with the different cation and anion concentrations. Using the Gaussian approximation and Stirling's formula, the analytic results for the average and variance of the net charge of a droplet are obtained.</description>

      <title>Ion adsorption and zeta potential of hydrophobic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrophobic interfaces have unique physicochemical properties and are used in various chemical products such as food, cosmetics, soap, and medicine and technologies such as pan coating and ski wax. In this chapter, we describe the fundamental concept of hydrophobic interfaces and explain their ion adsorption and zeta potential by using experimental data from the literature. Thus far, these electrical properties are considered universal for solid/water, liquid/water, and gas/water interfaces; however, a careful comparison in this chapter will reveal significant differences among them. To confirm that the affinity of H$^+$ ions for all hydrophobic interfaces is stronger than that of OH$^-$ ions, more experimental data on hydrophobic liquid/water and solid/water interfaces are required.</description>

      <title>A particle view of many-body electronic structure with neural network wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of electronic structure, the wavefunction view dominates the current research landscape and forms the theoretical foundation of modern quantum mechanics. In contrast, Valence Bond (VB) theory represents chemical bonds as shared electron-pairs and can provide an intuitive, particle-based insight into chemical bonding. In this work, using a newly developed Periodic Dynamic Voronoi Metropolis Sampling (PDVMS) method, we project classical many-body electronic configurations from the neural network wavefunction, and apply VB theory to construct a complementary particle-view paradigm. The powerful neural network wavefunction can achieve near-exact ab initio solutions for the ground state of both molecular and solid systems. It allows us to definitively characterize the ground state of benzene by reassessing the competition between its two VB structures. Extending PDVMS to solids for the first time, we also predict a spin-staggered VB structure in graphene, which explains emergent magnetic properties in graphene-based nanostructures. Furthermore, this particle view provides insight into the optimization process of the neural network wavefunction itself. Our work thus introduces a novel framework for analyzing many-body electronic structure in molecules and solids, opening new avenues for investigating this complex problem and its associated exotic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum biosensing on a multiplexed functionalized diamond microarray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to revolutionize biological research and medical diagnostics. Thanks to their high sensitivity, NV sensors could, in principle, detect specific binding events with metabolites and proteins in a massively parallel and label-free way, avoiding the complexity of mass spectrometry. Realizing this vision has been hindered by the lack of quantum sensor arrays that unite high-density spatial multiplexing with uncompromising biochemical specificity. Here, we introduce a scalable quantum biosensing platform that overcomes these barriers by integrating the first multiplexed DNA microarray directly onto a subnanometer antifouling diamond surface. The 7x7 DNA array, patterned onto a diamond chip, enables simultaneous detection of 49 distinct biomolecular features with high spatial resolution and reproducibility, as verified by fluorescence microscopy. Molecular recognition is converted into a quantum signal via a target-induced displacement mechanism in which hybridization removes a Gd$^{3+}$-tagged DNA strand, restoring NV center spin relaxation times (T$_1$) and producing a binary quantum readout. This platform establishes a new paradigm for high-throughput, multiplexed quantum biosensing and opens the door to advanced molecular diagnostics and large-scale quantum sensor networks operable in complex biological environments.</description>

      <title>A Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian Model for Hyperthermal Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering on semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on $c(2\times8)$Ge(111), for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model. Whereas mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface. We further show how nonadiabatic energy loss affects sticking, which is yet to be experimentally measured.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase Molecules in Protoplanetary Nebulae with the 21 {\mu}m Emission Feature II. Carbon monosulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carrier of the 21 ${\mu}$m emission feature discovered in a handful of protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe) is one of the most intriguing enigmas in circumstellar chemistry. Investigating the gas-phase molecules in PPNe could yield important hints for understanding the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. In this paper, we report observations of the CS $J = 5 \to 4$ line at 245 GHz and the CO $J = 1 \to 0$ line at 115 GHz toward seven PPNe exhibiting the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. We find that CS is extremely scarce in these PPNe and the CS line is only detected in one source, IRAS Z02229+6208. Based on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium and negligible optical depth, we derive that the CS column densities and fractional abundances relative to H$_{2}$ are $N$(CS) &lt; 9.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $f$(CS) &lt; 8.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{-7}$. A comparison of the CS abundances across different circumstellar envelopes reveals that the variations in CS abundance are complex, depending not only on the evolutionary stages but also on the properties of individual objects.</description>

      <title>Modification of adhesion between microparticles and engineered silicon surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three, or the force at which 50% of particles move by more than a factor of six, the compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.</description>
