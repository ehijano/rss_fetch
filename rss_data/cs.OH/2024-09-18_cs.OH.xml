      <title>Artificial Intelligence-based Smart Port Logistics Metaverse for Enhancing Productivity, Environment, and Safety in Port Logistics: A Case Study of Busan Port</title>

Abstract: The increase in global trade, the impact of COVID-19, and the tightening of environmental and safety regulations have brought significant changes to the maritime transportation market. To address these challenges, the port logistics sector is rapidly adopting advanced technologies such as big data, Internet of Things, and AI. However, despite these efforts, solving several issues related to productivity, environment, and safety in the port logistics sector requires collaboration among various stakeholders. In this study, we introduce an AI-based port logistics metaverse framework (PLMF) that facilitates communication, data sharing, and decision-making among diverse stakeholders in port logistics. The developed PLMF includes 11 AI-based metaverse content modules related to productivity, environment, and safety, enabling the monitoring, simulation, and decision making of real port logistics processes. Examples of these modules include the prediction of expected time of arrival, dynamic port operation planning, monitoring and prediction of ship fuel consumption and port equipment emissions, and detection and monitoring of hazardous ship routes and accidents between workers and port equipment. We conducted a case study using historical data from Busan Port to analyze the effectiveness of the PLMF. By predicting the expected arrival time of ships within the PLMF and optimizing port operations accordingly, we observed that the framework could generate additional direct revenue of approximately 7.3 million dollars annually, along with a 79% improvement in ship punctuality, resulting in certain environmental benefits for the port. These findings indicate that PLMF not only provides a platform for various stakeholders in port logistics to participate and collaborate but also significantly enhances the accuracy and sustainability of decision-making in port logistics through AI-based simulations.</description>
