      <title>An Improved Machine Learning Approach for RFI Mitigation in FAST-SETI Survey Archival Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) commensal surveys aim to scan the sky to detect technosignatures from extraterrestrial life. A major challenge in SETI is the effective mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI), a critical step that is particularly vital for the highly sensitive Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). While initial RFI mitigation (e.g., removal of persistent and drifting narrowband RFI) are essential, residual RFI often persists, posing significant challenges due to its complex and various nature. In this paper, we propose and apply an improved machine learning approach, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, to identify and mitigate residual RFI in FAST-SETI commensal survey archival data from July 2019. After initial RFI mitigation, we successfully identify and remove 36977 residual RFIs (accounting for $\sim$ 77.87\%) within approximately 1.678 seconds using the DBSCAN algorithm. This result shows that we have achieved a 7.44\% higher removal rate than previous machine learning methods, along with a 24.85\% reduction in execution time. We finally find interesting candidate signals consistent with previous studies, and retain one candidate signal following further analysis. Therefore, DBSCAN algorithm can mitigate more residual RFI with higher computational efficiency while preserving the candidate signals that we are interested in.</description>

      <title>Milky Way disc &amp; Bulge in situ populations: ESO white paper - Expanding horizons call</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of the Milky Way's disc, bar, and bulge remain fundamentally limited by the lack of a contiguous, Galaxy-wide, high-precision chemo-dynamical map. Key open questions - including the survival or destruction of the primitive discs, the origin of the bulge's multi-component structure, the role of mergers and secular processes, and the coupling between stellar chemistry, dynamics, and the Galactic potential - cannot be fully resolved with current or planned facilities. Existing spectroscopic surveys provide either high resolution for small samples or wide coverage at insufficient resolution and depth, and none can obtain homogeneous abundances, precise 3D kinematics, and reliable ages for the millions of stars required, particularly in the obscured midplane, the far side of the bar, or the outer, low-density disc. A new wide-field, massively multiplexed, large-aperture spectroscopic facility, capable of both high- and low-resolution spectroscopy over tens of thousands of square degrees, is therefore essential. Such a facility would deliver the statistical power, sensitivity, and completeness needed to reconstruct the Galaxy's assembly history, constrain its gravitational potential, and establish the Milky Way as the definitive benchmark for galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of white dwarfs in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs, the final evolutionary stage of the vast majority of stars, serve as critical tools for cosmochronology, studies of planetary system evolution, and laboratories for non-standard physics, including exotic cooling channels and weakly interacting particles, as well as crystallization processes. Beyond surface properties accessible via spectroscopy and model atmospheres, global pulsations exhibited by white dwarfs during various evolutionary phases provide a direct window into their deep interiors. Asteroseismology, the comparison of observed pulsation periods with theoretical models, enables us to infer internal chemical stratification, total mass, rotation profiles, and magnetic field strengths. Despite major advances from space missions providing uninterrupted, high-precision photometry, key challenges remain: many predicted pulsators remain quiet, while others oscillate outside theoretical instability strips, highlighting gaps in our understanding of mode excitation, diffusion, and convective mixing. Determining the masses of white dwarfs, particularly for massive and hydrogen-deficient stars, remains uncertain, with discrepancies between spectroscopic, asteroseismic, astrometric, and photometric methods. In the coming decades, large-scale surveys combining high-precision space-based photometry with coordinated ground-based spectroscopic follow-up will dramatically increase both the number and quality of pulsating white dwarf observations.</description>

      <title>Sailing to the next safe harbour in our trip to the early Universe: The massive star population of metal-poor galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very metal-poor massive stars in the Local Group are our best proxies for the Universe's first stars, making them essential for modeling reionization and early galactic chemical evolution. Studying such stars in our Local Universe is key to extrapolating our knowledge to more distant regions, where individual massive stars cannot be resolved but are dynamically and chemically shaping their environments. The MUSE integral field spectrograph has transformed massive star studies in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, but resolving star-forming galaxies containing very metal-poor stars is at the limit of the current field of view and sensitivity. Therefore, only small dedicated efforts of selected regions are studied, providing us with snapshots of low-metallicity massive stars rather than a comprehensive picture. This scarcity is a major bottleneck for understanding and sufficiently modelling the evolution and feedback of massive stars across cosmic time. We therefore envision a new generation of panoramic integral-field spectrographs and high multiplex multi-object spectrographs mounted on dedicated large optical telescopes. Such facilities will not only allow to resolve very-metal-pool galaxies, but further enable the systematic exploration of the massive stellar content across the entire Local Group, thereby reaching a new era in massive star studies and understanding.</description>

      <title>Nova Explosions in 2040</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novae are thermonuclear explosions on the surface of accreting white dwarfs and are key laboratories for studying explosive nucleosynthesis, particle acceleration, shock physics, and binary evolution. Despite major progress driven by wide-field time-domain surveys and multi-wavelength facilities, our understanding of nova explosions remains limited by incomplete temporal coverage, heterogeneous spectroscopic follow-up, and poorly constrained ejecta properties. In this white paper we outline the open scientific questions that will define nova research in the 2040s, focusing on the mass, composition, geometry, and dynamics of the ejecta, the role of the underlying binary system, and the connection between nuclear burning, shocks, and emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. We argue that decisive progress requires rapid-response, high-cadence, multi-wavelength observations, anchored by systematic high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy from eruption to quiescence. Finally, we identify key technological requirements needed to enable transformative advances in the physics of nova explosions over the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Ejection Physics at High Time Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion onto compact objects is one of the most fundamental phenomena in the astrophysics, powering some of the most luminous objects in the sky. Along with this, accretion has also a key impact on the evolution of the Universe, through the launch of powerful outflows that affect the surrounding medium. In the last years sub-second optical-infrared observations of accreting X-ray binaries have opened a new window in the study of inflow-outflow connection, discovering a wide range of previously unkown phenomena. Here we review the key open questions in accretion and ejection physics and discuss how a dedicated facility, equipped with photon-counting detectors and high spectral resolution from the UV to the mid-infrared, can enable transformative advances in our understanding of accretion processes.</description>

      <title>What Builds and Quenches the Most Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first few billion years of cosmic history witnessed the rapid emergence of the most massive galaxies, yet their true space density, baryon assembly pathways, and early quenching mechanisms remain poorly constrained. Current surveys lack the wide-field, rest-frame FIR sensitivity needed to obtain a complete census of massive systems and to trace their cold gas, dust, and diffuse emission on galactic and circumgalactic scales. A next-generation facility with a very large aperture, wide field of view, and high mapping speed is essential to carry out deep, degree-scale rest-frame FIR surveys. Such capabilities are required to determine how common massive galaxies are, how they assemble their baryons, and what physical processes drive their early transformation and quenching.</description>

      <title>Galaxies as stochastic systems: why the next breakthrough in galaxy evolution requires one hundred million spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each galaxy is observed only once along its life, making galaxy evolution fundamentally an inverse statistical problem: time-dependent physics must be inferred from ensembles of single-epoch snapshots. To move beyond descriptive scaling relations toward physical regulation mechanisms of star formation, quenching, chemical enrichment and black hole growth, galaxies must be treated as realizations of a stochastic process whose hyper-parameters (e.g., correlation timescales, burstiness, duty cycles) are inferred hierarchically. This demands both depth and scale: continuum S/N sufficient for absorption-line ages and chemistry, and samples far larger than those in SDSS, DESI, 4MOST or MOONS, which provide either depth or size but not both across $0&lt;z&lt;3$. Once the relevant axes of mass, redshift, environment, structure and evolutionary phase are populated, the requirement naturally rises from $10^7$ to $\sim10^8$ galaxies. This is the regime where stochastic hyper-parameters can be well constrained and where comparisons to simulations and cosmological forward models become limited by theory rather than observations. We outline the science enabled by such a programme and the corresponding requirements for a future ESO wide-field spectroscopic facility capable of delivering tens to hundreds of millions of rest-UV-optical spectra over $0\lesssim z\lesssim3$.</description>

      <title>Hunting exomoons with a kilometric baseline interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite numerous search campaigns based on a diverse set of observational techniques, exomoons - prospective satellites of extrasolar planets - remain an elusive and hard-to-pin-down class of objects. Yet, the case for intensifying this search is compelling: as in the Solar System, moons can act as proxies for studying planet formation and evolution, provide direct clues as to the migration history of the planetary hosts and, in favourable cases, offer potentially habitable environments. Here, we present an investigation into how the search for exomoons would benefit from a new interferometric facility operating in the optical wavelength domain and leveraging baselines substantially longer than the ones the VLTI is currently equipped with. We find that an interferometer providing an astrometric precision of 1$\,\mu$as would be able to robustly detect Earth-mass and sub-Earth-mass exomoons on dynamically stable orbits around Jupiter-like planets at distances between 50 and 200 pc.</description>

      <title>Binarity Beyond Gaia: The case for a dedicated spectroscopic survey of binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is a fundamental ingredient of stellar astrophysics, yet binary statistics across the Galaxy remain poorly constrained. The \emph{Gaia} mission has revolutionised binary star astrophysics by delivering high-precision astrometry, photometry and global radial velocities, and by providing hundreds of thousands of non-single-star solutions in DR3. However, the RVS magnitude limit, mission time span and scanning law impose strong selection effects in period, mass ratio, inclination and semi-amplitude, leaving large regions of the binary parameter space either sparsely sampled or effectively inaccessible. In this white paper we outline the case for a dedicated, wide-field, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey explicitly optimised for binary science: deeper than the \emph{Gaia} RVS limit, with flexible cadence from hours to years, and with moderate to high spectral resolution. Using a simplified forward model of \emph{Gaia} DR5-like performance, we highlight the populations for which robust orbital solutions will be rare (ultra short period, very long period, low-amplitude and compact-object binaries), and show how a ``Binarity Beyond \emph{Gaia}'' survey would fill these gaps. Such a programme would deliver a bias correctable census of stellar multiplicity across the Milky Way and provide the spectroscopic backbone needed to exploit binary samples from \emph{Rubin}/LSST, \emph{Roman} and \emph{LISA}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown tremendous promise in solving problems in high energy physics, materials science, and fluid dynamics. In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Expanding Horizons - Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s Time-Domain Multi-Messenger Astronomy in the 2040s: EM Follow-up of LGWA Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coming decades will see gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy expand decisively into the mHz-Hz frequency range, opening access to a population of compact binaries that are currently invisible or only detectable moments before merger. The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) concept is designed to probe this gap, enabling continuous observation of compact binaries over months to years prior to coalescence, and detecting sources inaccessible to both space-based mHz detectors and current ground-based &gt;10 Hz facilities. This new GW window fundamentally alters the landscape of time-domain multi-messenger astronomy. Rather than reacting to mergers after the fact, LGWA enables predictive, scheduled electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, transforming how compact-object mergers, their environments, and their astrophysical channels are studied. However, fully exploiting LGWA discoveries requires EM capabilities that do not exist today and are unlikely to be available by the 2030s, particularly for wide-area, rapid, spectroscopically rich follow-up at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This White Paper identifies the key science cases enabled by LGWA that motivate new ground-based capabilities in the 2040s.</description>

      <title>Radio frequency interference identification using eigenvalue decomposition for multi-beam observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the installation of next-generation phased array feed (PAF) receivers on radio telescopes, there is an urgent need to develop effective and computationally efficient radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation methods for large-scale surveys. Here we present a new RFI mitigation package, called mRAID (multi-beam RAdio frequency Interference Detector), which uses the eigenvalue decomposition algorithm to identify RFI in cross-correlation matrix (CCM) of data recorded by multiple beams. When applied to high time-resolution pulsar search data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), mRAID demonstrates excellent performance in identifying RFI over short timescales, thereby enhancing the efficiency of pulsar and fast radio burst (FRB) searches. Since the computation of the CCM and the eigenvalue decomposition for each time sub-integration and frequency channel are independent, the process is fully parallelisable. As a result, mRAID offers a significant computational advantage over commonly used RFI detection methods.</description>

      <title>New methods to improve the decontamination of slitless spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes four new methods to decontaminate spectra of stars and galaxies resulting from slitless spectroscopy used in many space missions such as Euclid. These methods are based on two distinct approaches and simultaneously take into account multiple dispersion directions of light. The first approach, called the local instantaneous approach, is based on an approximate linear instantaneous model. The second approach, called the local convolutive approach, is based on a more realistic convolutive model that allows simultaneous decontamination and deconvolution of spectra. For each approach, a mixing model was developed that links the observed data to the source spectra. This was done either in the spatial domain for the local instantaneous approach or in the Fourier domain for the local convolutive approach. Four methods were then developed to decontaminate these spectra from the mixtures, exploiting the direct images provided by photometers. Test results obtained using realistic, noisy, Euclid-like data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the sensitivity of ELT to habitable worlds with a space-based starshade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ELT will provide groundbreaking science across a wide range of areas, including small habitable-zone exoplanets; however, true Earth analogs in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars are generally beyond the reach even of the ELT, due to the extreme contrast ratio and small angular separation between the planet and star. Here, we note that the combination of ELT and a space-based starshade would provide the contrast needed to observe potentially tens of Earth analogs, as well as other planets. This would yield the scientific basis needed for addressing central scientific questions regarding the frequency and distribution of habitability and life in the Universe. The huge aperture of ELT, combined with a contrast otherwise only reachable in space, opens up scientific avenues that are unmatched by any other existing or foreseen facility. ESO could conceivably collaborate with ESA (and others) to facilitate a starshade mission suitable for synergy with the ELT, as well as to prepare the ELT instrumentation in order to maximize its potential for synergy with a starshade.</description>

      <title>Transformational astrophysics and exoplanet science with Habitable Worlds Observatory's High Resolution Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be NASA's flagship space telescope of the 2040s, designed to search for life on other planets and to transform broad areas of astrophysics. NASA are seeking international partners, and the UK is well-placed to lead the design and construction of its imaging camera - which is likely to produce the mission's most visible public impact. Early participation in the mission would return investment to UK industry, and bring generational leadership for the UK in space science, space technology, and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>A direction-dependent framework for visibility plane mosaicing and primary beam correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing sensitivity of modern radio interferometers, it has become important to image objects larger than the field of view while optimising sensitivity and image fidelity. We present a coherent visibility plane direction-dependent imaging, calibration and mosaicing framework. Our simulations and application to real MeerKAT data show that this joint deconvolution and primary beam correction approach, coupled with direction-dependent calibration, allows for deeper mosaics with greater fidelity and increased accuracy of recovered flux densities and spectral indices, especially beyond the half-power beam width. Our best-case mosaic produces precise flux values within a 6% uncertainty and spectral indices within 20\% throughout the imaged area, and is fully complete out to twice the radii and half the flux density than the image plane equivalent. The application to archival wideband MeerKAT 1283 MHz data produces the deepest high-resolution image of the Shapley Supercluster Core, with a sensitivity of 3.6 $\mu$Jy/beam within the primary beam at a 7$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, constituting a $\sim$ 50% increase in dynamic range over the image plane counterpart, and a fluxscale that is consistent within 10% across the entire field of view. The compute time for the direction-dependent visibility plane mosaic was comparable to the sum of the times needed to perform direction-dependent calibration on the individual pointings. Our results suggest that visibility plane mosaicing with its capability for deeper deconvolution could improve the efficiency of deep and wide surveys, particularly for on-the-fly mapping and studies of low surface brightness sources, and could form the basis of future calibration pipelines for SKA-scale instruments.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting - III Deriving exact posteriors with dimension reduction and importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) with neural posterior estimation (NPE) provides rapid X-ray spectral fitting in both Gaussian and Poisson regimes by learning approximate parameter posteriors from simulations. We investigate auto-encoders for compressing high-resolution X-ray spectra, motivated by newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), and use likelihood-based importance sampling to refine NPE outputs. Our auto-encoder maps spectra to a low-dimensional latent space and is trained with a custom loss equal to the Cash statistic (C-stat) between simulated and reconstructed spectra. A neural density estimator is then trained on the latent representations. Both models are trained in multiple rounds: at each round, new simulations are drawn from a truncated proposal concentrated around the observation, improving efficiency as the proposal contracts. After NPE convergence, we apply likelihood-based importance sampling to correct the learned posterior. To assess information retention, we train a diagnostic network that predicts the original spectral parameters from the latent space, and we also train a network to learn the likelihood directly to accelerate importance sampling. On X-IFU-like simulations, the auto-encoder and multi-round NPE outperforms PCA and hand-crafted spectral summaries in accuracy and robustness. After importance sampling, the resulting posteriors are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with nested sampling. On a standard laptop, the full pipeline (simulation, compression, inference, correction) delivers 10x speedups. We further demonstrate the approach on XRISM/Resolve and on lower-resolution NICER and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data, confirming applicability across instruments and resolutions. Overall, NPE on compressed spectra paired with likelihood-based importance sampling offers an exact yet efficient alternative for Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting.</description>

      <title>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new near-infrared time-domain survey instrument installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of the recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for near-infrared photometry without cryogenic cooling. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 degree-squared field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Accurate Effective Point Spread Function (ePSF) Modelling on Undersampled Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of the effective point spread function (ePSF) is essential for high-precision photometry and astrometry, particularly in undersampled imaging regimes. In this work, we build on a well-established ePSF modelling framework and its commonly used open-source Python implementation and demonstrate that several simple but effective modifications to existing ePSF modelling routines can significantly improve model accuracy. We use synthetic ePSFs to generate simulated datasets of stellar images, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy of ePSF models and determine the scale of the pixel-phase errors in resulting flux and position measurements. We systematically investigate how specific modelling choices affect ePSF accuracy, and evaluate the influence of oversampling, interpolation, gridpoint estimation, smoothing, star-sample distribution, and dithering on photometric precision. We apply our refined ePSF modelling routine to images from the Global Jet Watch observatories, demonstrating its improved ability to recover an accurate ePSF for real astronomical images. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring the modelling approach to the specific characteristics of the instrument and detector, as well as to the nature of the available imaging data used to construct the ePSF model. These results provide practical guidance for optimising ePSF construction, thereby improving the reliability of photometric and astrometric measurements.</description>

      <title>Density reconstruction from biased tracers: Testing the equivalence principle through consistency relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful test of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales. If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\mathrm{max}\simeq0.15\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling. This article introduces the Special Issue on Symbolic Regression for the Physical Sciences, motivated by the Royal Society discussion meeting held in April 2025. The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.
  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.</description>

      <title>LSTM-MDNz: Estimating Quasar Photometric Redshifts with an LSTM-Augmented Mixture Density Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasar photometric redshifts are essential for studying cosmology and large-scale structures. However, their complex spectral energy distributions cause significant redshift-color degeneracy, limiting the accuracy of traditional methods. To overcome this, we introduce LSTM-MDNz, a novel end-to-end deep learning model combining long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with mixture density networks (MDN). The model directly uses multi-band photometric fluxes and associated errors as wavelength-ordered sequential inputs, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering while enabling simultaneous point estimation and probability distribution function (PDF) prediction of quasar redshifts. We integrate data from four major sky surveys-SDSS, DESI-LS, WISE, and GALEX-to assemble a sample of over 550,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ($0 \leq z_{\mathrm{spec}} \leq 5$) across 14 ultraviolet to infrared bands for model training and testing. Experimental results show that using all 14 bands yields optimal performance, with a normalized median absolute deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$) of 0.037 and an outlier rate ($f_{\mathrm{out}}$) of 3.5\% on the test set. These values represent reductions of 29\% and 56\%, respectively, compared to the commonly adopted SDSS+WISE band set. Probability integral transform ($\mathrm{PIT}$) and continuous ranked probability score ($\mathrm{CRPS}$) analyses confirm that the predicted PDFs align closely with the true redshift distribution. Band-ablation experiments further highlight the essential role of ultraviolet and infrared data in alleviating color degeneracy and reducing systematic bias. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-band fusion in improving quasar photo-z accuracy and offers a ready-to-use estimation framework for future surveys like LSST, CSST, and Euclid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large instantaneous sensitivity, a wide frequency coverage and flexible observation modes with large number of beams in the sky are the main features of the SKA observatory's two telescopes, the SKA-Low and the SKA-Mid, which are located on two different continents. Owing to these capabilities, the SKAO telescopes are going to be a game-changer for radio astronomy in general and pulsar astronomy in particular. The eleven articles in this special issue on pulsar science with the SKA Observatory describe its impact on different areas of pulsar science. In this lead article, a brief description of the two telescopes highlighting the relevant features for pulsar science is presented followed by an overview of each accompanying article, exploring the inter-relationship between different pulsar science use cases.</description>

      <title>A Square Kilometre Array Pulsar Census</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the pulsar science case with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) depends on long-term precision pulsar timing of a large number of pulsars, as well as astrometric measurements of these using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). But before we can time them, or VLBI them, we must first find them. Here, we describe the considerations and strategies one needs to account for when planning an all-sky blind pulsar survey using the SKA. Based on our understanding of the pulsar population, the performance of the now-under-construction SKA elements, and practical constraints such as evading radio frequency interference, we project pulsar survey yields using two complementary methods for a number of illustrative survey designs, combining SKA1-Low and SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2 in a variety of ways. A composite survey using both Mid and Low is optimal, with Mid Band 2 focused in the plane. We find that, given its much higher effective area and survey speed, the best strategy is to use SKA1-Low to cover as much sky as possible, ideally also overlapping with the areas covered by Mid. In our most realistic scenario, we find that an all-sky blind survey with Phase 1 of the SKA with the AA* array assembly will detect $\sim10,000$ slow pulsars and $\sim 800$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs) if SKA1-Mid covers the region within $5\deg$ of the plane, while higher latitudes will be covered with SKA1-Low. The yield with AA4 is $\sim 20\%$ higher. One could increase these numbers by increasing the range covered by SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2, at the cost of a considerably longer survey. The pulsar census will enable us to set new constraints on the uncertain physical properties of the entire neutron star population. This will be crucial for addressing major SKA science questions including the dense-matter equation of state, strong-field gravity tests, and gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

Abstract: The known population of non-accreting neutron stars is ever growing and currently consists of more than 3500 sources. Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of neutron stars and discuss how the SKAO telescopes will aid in our understanding of the neutron star population.</description>

      <title>Probing neutron star interiors and the properties of cold ultra-dense matter with the SKAO</title>

Abstract: Matter inside neutron stars is compressed to densities several times greater than nuclear saturation density, while maintaining low temperatures and large asymmetries between neutrons and protons. Neutron stars, therefore, provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in environments that cannot be recreated on Earth. To uncover the highly uncertain nature of cold, ultra-dense matter, discovering and monitoring pulsars is essential, and the SKA will play a crucial role in this endeavour. In this paper, we will present the current state-of-the-art in dense matter physics and dense matter superfluidity, and discuss recent advances in measuring global neutron star properties (masses, moments of inertia, and maximum rotation frequencies) as well as non-global observables (pulsar glitches and free precession). We will specifically highlight how radio observations of isolated neutron stars and those in binaries -- such as those performed with the SKA in the near future -- inform our understanding of ultra-dense physics and address in detail how SKAO's telescopes unprecedented sensitivity, large-scale survey and sub-arraying capabilities will enable novel dense matter constraints. We will also address the potential impact of dark matter and modified gravity models on these constraints and emphasise the role of synergies between the SKA and other facilities, specifically X-ray telescopes and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>The SKAO Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are ensembles of millisecond pulsars observed for years to decades. The primary goal of PTAs is to study gravitational-wave astronomy at nanohertz frequencies, with secondary goals of undertaking other fundamental tests of physics and astronomy. Recently, compelling evidence has emerged in established PTA experiments for the presence of a gravitational-wave background. To accelerate a confident detection of such a signal and then study gravitational-wave emitting sources, it is necessary to observe a larger number of millisecond pulsars to greater timing precision. The SKAO telescopes, which will be a factor of three to four greater in sensitivity compared to any other southern hemisphere facility, are poised to make such an impact. In this chapter, we motivate an SKAO pulsar timing array (SKAO PTA) experiment. We discuss the classes of gravitational waves present in PTA observations and how an SKAO PTA can detect and study them. We then describe the sources that can produce these signals. We discuss the astrophysical noise sources that must be mitigated to undertake the most sensitive searches. We then describe a realistic PTA experiment implemented with the SKA and place it in context alongside other PTA experiments likely ongoing in the 2030s. We describe the techniques necessary to search for gravitational waves in the SKAO PTA and motivate how very long baseline interferometry can improve the sensitivity of an SKAO PTA. The SKAO PTA will provide a view of the Universe complementary to those of the other large facilities of the 2030s.</description>

      <title>Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</description>

      <title>ALMA and JWST Identification of Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies up to z~8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit a new sample of around 400 bright dusty galaxies from the ALMA CHAMPS Large Program, together with the rich JWST multi-band data products in the COSMOS field, to explore and validate new selection methods for identifying dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here, we present an effective empirical selection criterion based on a newly defined parameter: I_star = log(M_star) x log(SFR). Incorporating the F277W-F444W color as a second parameter further improves the purity of the selection. We then apply this method to the COSMOS2025 catalog to search for fainter dusty galaxy candidates below the ALMA CHAMPS detection limit and, through a stacking technique, identify a population of high-redshift (z=6-8) DSFGs with an average flux density of$S_1.2mm = 0.15uJy and a space density of ~6E-6 Mpc^-3. This faint population seems to have been missed by most of the previous submillimeter/millimeter surveys, and ground- and space-based UV-to-NIR surveys. Finally, we discuss the possibility of an evolutionary connection between the z &gt; 10 UV-bright galaxies recently discovered by JWST, the faint dusty z=6-8 galaxies identified here, and the population of z=3-5 massive quiescent galaxies, potentially linked as progenitor-descendant populations based on their abundance, redshifts, and stellar masses.</description>

      <title>Uniform Rolling: An LSST Observing Cadence Offering Sufficient Survey Uniformity for Comprehensive Cosmological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) that will be carried out by the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory promises to be the defining survey of the next decade, supplying unprecedented access to the night sky to static science- and time-domain science-focused researchers alike. Maximizing the output of the broad remit of Rubin Observatory science requires a non-trivial survey strategy. For time-domain science, the most promising strategy designed so far is a rolling survey strategy, whereby a subset of the full LSST survey area is observed at higher rate compared with the nominal rate dictated by weather conditions and the observatory's technical constraints. This strategy is now the baseline approach for the LSST as a whole. Focusing on static science (galaxy clustering and weak lensing), we study how these time-domain-optimized rolling strategies affect the depth uniformity at intermediate years of the survey. We characterize the amount of survey area at high risk of being lost in static-science analyses of a baseline rolling LSST dataset due to an insufficient combination of survey contiguity and uniformity. At intermediate data releases, nearly half of the survey could be lost for static science, decreasing the Dark Energy figure of merit by approximately 40\%. We describe additional metrics focused on key analysis tasks, such as photometric redshifts and galaxy clustering. We propose a new strategy that returns the survey to uniformity at key release years, enabling use of the full survey area and restoring our metrics to the values they would have in a non-rolling cadence without loss of time domain data relative to a rolling survey with the same number of rolling cycles. This work has informed the third round of optimization of the survey strategy, and the new uniform rolling strategies have been incorporated into the baseline strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mauve is a low-cost small satellite developed and operated by Blue Skies Space Ltd. The payload features a 13 cm telescope connected with a fibre that feeds into a UV-Vis spectrometer. The detector covers the 200-700 nm range in a single shot, obtaining low resolution spectra at R~20-65. Mauve has launched on 28th November 2025, reaching a 510 km Low-Earth Sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite will enable UV and visible observations of a variety of stellar objects in our Galaxy, filling the gaps in the ultraviolet space-based data. The researchers that have already joined the mission have defined the science themes, observational strategy and targets that Mauve will observe in the first year of operations. To date, 10 science themes have been developed by the Mauve science collaboration for year 1, with observational strategies that include both long duration monitoring and short cadence snapshots. Here, we describe these themes and the science that Mauve will undertake in its first year of operations.</description>

      <title>Robust CMB B-mode analysis with Needlet-ILC and simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel analysis framework for parameter inference with large-scale CMB polarization data. Our method uses simulation-based inference combined with the needlet internal linear combination (NILC) algorithm and cross-correlation-based statistics to compress the data into a vector that is robust to model misspecification and small enough to be amenable to neural posterior estimation with normalizing flows. By leveraging this compressed data representation, our method enables the robust use of the anisotropic and non-Gaussian information in the foreground fields to more accurately separate the CMB polarization signal from these contaminants. Using an idealized ground-based experimental setup inspired by the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes, we demonstrate improved statistical constraining power for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ compared to the (constrained) NILC algorithm and improved robustness to complex foregrounds compared to other techniques in the literature. Trained on a relatively simple semi-analytical foreground model, the method yields unbiased $r$ results across a range of PySM Galactic foreground simulations, including the high-complexity d12 model, for which we obtain $r=(1.09 \pm 0.27)\cdot 10^{-2}$ for input $r=0.01$ and sky fraction $f_{\mathrm{sky}} = 0.21$. We thus demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a complete, maps-to-parameters, simulation-based analysis of large-scale CMB polarization for current ground-based observatories.</description>

Abstract: Modern radio interferometers are designed with increasingly sprawling geographical footprints, offering enhanced sensitivity and resolution. However, managing such extensive facilities presents operational challenges that can potentially impede or delay scientific progress. One solution to such obstacles is the `swarm telescope' concept which enables collaborative use of individual telescope systems, overseen by separate institutions, to create a more powerful and manageable facility. We present the design, construction, and commissioning of the Long Wavelength Array -- North Arm (LWA-NA) station, a prototype 64-element LWA Swarm telescope. LWA-NA is a cost-efficient, rapidly deployable platform for radio astronomy, and serves as a pathfinder for the larger LWA Swarm project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LuSEE-Night is a pathfinder radio telescope on the lunar far side employing four 3-m monopole antennas arranged as two horizontal cross pseudo-dipoles on a rotational stage and sensitive to the radio sky in the 1-50 MHz frequency band. LuSEE-Night measures the corresponding 16 correlation products as a function of frequency. While each antenna combination measures radiation coming from a large area of the sky, their aggregate information as a function of phase in the lunar cycle and rotational stage position can be deconvolved into a low-resolution map of the sky. We study this deconvolution using linear map-making based on the Wiener filter algorithm. We illustrate how systematic effects can be effectively marginalised over as contributions to the noise covariance and demonstrate this technique on beam knowledge uncertainty and gain fluctuations. With reasonable assumptions about instrument performance, we show that LuSEE-Night should be able to map the sub-50 MHz sky at a ~5-degree resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underground laboratories provide the ultra-low background and low-vibration environments essential for rare-event searches, gravitational-wave detection, and quantum-sensing technologies. We report a comprehensive environmental characterisation of the Bedretto tunnel in Ticino, Switzerland, a site offering horizontal access, excellent infrastructure, and the potential to be be Europe's second-deepest and quietest underground laboratory. At the prospective physics site, located beneath an overburden exceeding 1400 m, we measure the cosmic-muon, gamma-ray, and neutron fluxes, as well as the radon concentration, magnetic-field spectrum, and seismic backgrounds. The muon flux is suppressed by six orders of magnitude relative to the surface, consistent with an effective depth of about 4000 metre water equivalent, gamma-ray and neutron measurements reflect the local geology and guide shielding requirements for future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Magnetic and seismic noise levels are found to be exceptionally low, meeting or exceeding the criteria for next-generation atom-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. These results establish the site as a highly competitive, accessible deep-underground location for fundamental-physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: This work aims to choose potential astronomical sites that can be candidates for a new astronomical optical observatory in Ethiopia, in addition to the Entoto Observatory and Lalibela sites. For our primary investigation, the six basic criteria, namely the altitude of the mountains, artificial light pollution, cloud coverage, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, are taken into account. Consequently, using the multi-criteria statistical analysis (MCSA) techniques, 21 high-potential places are selected and presented for further investigation out of 367 mountains. Those selected mountains are mapped and presented to study the future of the astronomical seeing effect. This study may contribute to the protection of those potential astronomical sites and their dark skies and the development of astrotourism for the sustainable development of modern astronomy in Ethiopia and in the East African region.</description>

Abstract: The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) included the European Solar Telescope (EST) as an ESFRI Project in its 2016 Roadmap and confirmed this status in 2021. During the Preparatory Phase (2017 to 2022), the EST Science Advisory Group (SAG) was established in 2017. Its first task was to revise the Science Requirements Document (SRD), originally formulated in 2011. This second edition of the SRD was published in December 2019 (Schlichenmaier et al. 2019, 2019arXiv191208650S).
  Since 2019, the EST Project Office has advanced the telescope design and developed the Science Instrumentation Suite (SIS). All telescope subsystems and the SIS have now passed their Design Reviews. Aligned with the discussions and resolutions of the SAG, the SIS comprises three categories of first-generation instruments: (1) Tunable Imaging Spectropolarimeters coupled with Fixed Band Imagers (TIS/FBIs), employing large-aperture Fabry-P\'erot etalons; (2) Integral Field Spectropolarimeters based on microlens arrays (IFS-M); (3) The near-infrared spectropolarimeter EMBER (spectropolariMeter Based on slicEr-mirrors for the near-infraRed), using image-slicing technology. This configuration enables simultaneous observations of the same two-dimensional solar region across a broad wavelength range (380-2200 nm), giving EST a uniquely powerful multi-wavelength observing capability.
  This has made it necessary to revise the Observing Programmes so that they accurately reflect the capabilities of the SIS and ensure that all science objectives can be met. This third edition of the EST SRD integrates the outcomes of numerous SAG meetings held between 2020 and 2025 and incorporates all design developments up to 2025. It updates the Observing Programmes accordingly and assesses their alignment with the scientific objectives defined by the SAG.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking field-level cosmological inference from galaxy redshift surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-level inference has emerged as a promising framework to fully harness the cosmological information encoded in next-generation galaxy surveys. It involves performing Bayesian inference to jointly estimate the cosmological parameters and the initial conditions of the cosmic field, directly from the observed galaxy density field. Yet, the scalability and efficiency of sampling algorithms for field-level inference of large-scale surveys remain unclear. To address this, we introduce a standardized benchmark using a fast and differentiable simulator for the galaxy density field based on $\texttt{JaxPM}$. We evaluate a range of sampling methods, including standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) without and within a Gibbs scheme, and both adjusted and unadjusted microcanonical samplers (MAMS and MCLMC). These methods are compared based on their efficiency, in particular the number of model evaluations required per effective posterior sample. Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully preconditioning latent variables and demonstrate the significant advantage of (unadjusted) MCLMC for scaling to $\geq 10^6$-dimensional problems. We find that MCLMC outperforms adjusted samplers by over an order-of-magnitude, with a mild scaling with the dimension of our inference problem. This benchmark, along with the associated publicly available code, is intended to serve as a basis for the evaluation of future field-level sampling strategies. The code is readily open-sourced at https://github.com/hsimonfroy/benchmark-field-level</description>

      <title>LITMUS: Bayesian Lag Recovery in Reverberation Mapping with Fast Differentiable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping is a technique in which the mass of a Seyfert I galaxy's central supermassive black hole is estimated, along with the system's physical scale, from the timescale at which variations in brightness propagate through the galactic nucleus. This mapping allows for a long baseline of time measurements to extract spatial information beyond the angular resolution of our telescopes, and is the main means of constraining supermassive black hole masses at high redshift. The most recent generation of multi-year reverberation mapping campaigns for large numbers of active galactic nuclei (e.g. OzDES) have had to deal with persistent complications of identifying false positives, such as those arising from aliasing due to seasonal gaps in time-series data. We introduce LITMUS (Lag Inference Through the Mixed Use of Samplers), a modern lag recovery tool built on the "damped random walk" model of quasar variability, built in the autodiff framework JAX. LITMUS is purpose built to handle the multimodal aliasing of seasonal observation windows and provides evidence integrals for model comparison, a more quantified alternative to existing methods of lag validation. LITMUS also offers a flexible modular framework for extending modelling of AGN variability, and includes JAX-enabled implementations of other popular lag recovery methods like nested sampling and the interpolated cross correlation function. We test LITMUS on a number of mock light curves modelled after the OzDES sample and find that it recovers their lags with high precision and a successfully identifies spurious lag recoveries, reducing its false positive rate to drastically outperform the state of the art program JAVELIN. LITMUS's high performance is accomplished by an algorithm for mapping the Bayesian posterior density which both constrains the lag and offers a Bayesian framework for model null hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Segmentation and Tracking of Eruptive Solar Phenomena with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar eruptive events are complex phenomena, which most often include coronal mass ejections (CME), CME-driven compressive and shock waves, flares, and filament eruptions. CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO/AIA instrument data.</description>

      <title>Backtracking Bipolar Magnetic Regions to their emergence: Two groups and their implication in the tilt measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) that appear on the solar photosphere are surface manifestations of the Suns internal magnetic field. With modern observations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from manual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this work, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm, AutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically, for regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs to their point of emergence. From a total of about 12,000 BMRs identified by AutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3,080 cases. Within this backtracked sample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected behavior of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases significantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose flux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution, the instances where our algorithm fails to capture the initial emergence of the BMRs. We classify these as discarded BMRs and examine their statistical properties separately. Our analysis shows that these discarded BMRs do not display any preferred tilt angle distribution and do not show systematic latitudinal tilt dependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs. This indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR properties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We therefore emphasise the importance of excluding the discarded population from the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behavior of BMRs.</description>

      <title>Wave Front Sensing demodulated at the difference frequency between two phase-modulation sidebands in a compound interferometer configuration for a gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, "Phase-Modulated-sideband $\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>
