      <title>Emotion Collider: Dual Hyperbolic Mirror Manifolds for Sentiment Recovery via Anti Emotion Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional expression underpins natural communication and effective human-computer interaction. We present Emotion Collider (EC-Net), a hyperbolic hypergraph framework for multimodal emotion and sentiment modeling. EC-Net represents modality hierarchies using Poincare-ball embeddings and performs fusion through a hypergraph mechanism that passes messages bidirectionally between nodes and hyperedges. To sharpen class separation, contrastive learning is formulated in hyperbolic space with decoupled radial and angular objectives. High-order semantic relations across time steps and modalities are preserved via adaptive hyperedge construction. Empirical results on standard multimodal emotion benchmarks show that EC-Net produces robust, semantically coherent representations and consistently improves accuracy, particularly when modalities are partially available or contaminated by noise. These findings indicate that explicit hierarchical geometry combined with hypergraph fusion is effective for resilient multimodal affect understanding.</description>

      <title>Edge Learning via Federated Split Decision Transformers for Metaverse Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) based wireless metaverse services offer an untethered, immersive experience to users, where the superior quality of experience (QoE) needs to be achieved under stringent latency constraints and visual quality demands. To achieve this, MEC-based intelligent resource allocation for virtual reality users needs to be supported by coordination across MEC servers to harness distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution, and can be combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to develop generalized policies across MEC-servers. However, conventional FL incurs transmitting the full model parameters across the MEC-servers and the cloud, and suffer performance degradation due to naive global aggregation, especially in heterogeneous multi-radio access technology environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline RL framework where the transformer model is partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud. Agent-specific components (e.g., MEC-based embedding and prediction layers) enable local adaptability, while shared global layers in the cloud facilitate cooperative training across MEC servers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSDT enhances QoE for up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to baselines, while offloadingnearly 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud, thereby reducing the computational burden on MEC servers.</description>

      <title>ModalImmune: Immunity Driven Unlearning via Self Destructive Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.</description>

      <title>Protocol as Poetry: A Case Study of Pak's Smart Contract-Based Protocol Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protocol art has recently proliferated through blockchain-based smart contracts, building on a century-long lineage of conceptual, participatory, interactive, systematic, algorithmic, and generative art practices. Few studies have examined the characteristics and appreciation of this emerging art form. To address this gap, this paper presents an annotated portfolio analysis of protocol artworks by Pak, a pioneering and influential pseudonymous artist who treats smart contracts as medium and collective participation through protocol as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible (2021) and the dynamic mechanics of Merge (2021) to the soul-bound messaging of Censored (2022) and the reflective absence of Not Found (2023), we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous code, demonstrating how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics distinguishing protocol art from other art forms: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance enabling open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economy-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedded in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergent complexity. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent movements such as conceptual, generative, participatory, interactive, and performance art. By analyzing principles grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocol art (or "protocolism") and offer design implications for future artists exploring this evolving form.</description>
