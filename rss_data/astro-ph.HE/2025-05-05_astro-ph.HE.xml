      <title>X-ray Emission Signatures of Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) mergers, including both binary NS mergers and black hole - NS mergers, are multi-messenger sources detectable in both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The expected EM emission signatures depend on the source's progenitor, merger remnant, and observer's line of sight (LoS). Widely discussed EM counterparts of NS mergers have been focused in the gamma-ray (in terms of short-duration gamma-ray bursts) and optical (in terms of kilonova) bands. In this paper, we show that X-ray emission carries unique post-merger signatures that are inaccessible in other EM bands and plays an important role in understanding the physics and geometry of these mergers. We consider several binary progenitor and central engine models and investigate X-ray emission signatures from the prompt phase immediately after the merger to the afterglow phase extending years later. For the prompt phase, we devise a general method for computing phenomenological X-ray light curves and spectra for structured jets viewed from any LoS, which can be applied to X-ray observations of NS mergers to constrain the geometry. The geometric constraints can in turn be used to model the afterglow and estimate a peak time and flux -- to preemptively determine afterglow characteristics would be monumental for follow-up observation campaigns of future GW sources. Finally, we provide constraints on the time window for X-ray counterpart searches of NS mergers across a range of luminosity distances and detector sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Millisecond Pulsars: Off-pulse Emission Characteristics, Phase-Resolved Pseudo-Luminosity--Cutoff Energy Correlation, and High-energy Pulsed Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are prominent GeV $\gamma$-ray emitters, but their emission mechanisms, especially during off-pulse phases and at high energies, remain debated. We analyze 38 MSPs using approximately 15 years of $Fermi$-LAT data. Employing high-precision ephemerides and Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we detect significant off-pulse emission from 15 MSPs. Spectral analysis reveals significant cutoffs in 10 of these, favoring a magnetospheric origin. The remaining 5 likely also have magnetospheric emission with cutoffs below current sensitivity. Phase-resolved spectral analysis for the 15 MSPs with off-pulse flux shows a significant correlation between cutoff energy ($E_{\text{cut}}$) and average photon counts in 11 sources. We introduce a phase-resolved pseudo-luminosity ($L$) and discover a novel, statistically significant linear correlation between $\log_{10}(L)$ and $\log_{10}(E_{\text{cut}})$ across their phase bins, with the best-fit slope $\alpha = 2.31^{+0.22}_{-0.25}$. Furthermore, we detect significant pulsed emission above 10 GeV from 9 MSPs with off-pulse emission and 7 others (totaling 16 MSPs and tripling previous cataloged detections). Emission above 25 GeV is confirmed for PSR J0614$-$3329 and newly detected for PSR J1536$-$4948, both of which also exhibit significant off-pulse emission. Their highest-energy photons ($\sim$61 GeV and $\sim$57 GeV, respectively) coincide with pulse peaks. The co-existence of significant off-pulse emission and high-energy pulsed emission challenges standard Outer Gap models, while the observed $\log_{10}(L)$-$\log_{10}(E_{\text{cut}})$ correlation may provide new evidence supporting the equatorial current sheet scenario.</description>

      <title>High optical to X-ray polarization ratio reveals Compton scattering in BL Lacertae's jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, supermassive black hole systems (SMBHs) with highly relativistic jets aligned with the line of sight, are the most powerful long-lived emitters of electromagnetic emission in the Universe. We report here on a radio to gamma-ray multiwavelength campaign on the blazar BL Lacertae with unprecedented polarimetric coverage from radio to X-ray wavelengths. The observations caught an extraordinary event on 2023 November 10-18, when the degree of linear polarization of optical synchrotron radiation reached a record value of 47.5%. In stark contrast, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) found that the X-ray (Compton scattering or hadron-induced) emission was polarized at less than 7.4% (3sigma confidence level). We argue here that this observational result rules out a hadronic origin of the high energy emission, and strongly favors a leptonic (Compton scattering) origin, thereby breaking the degeneracy between hadronic and leptonic emission models for BL Lacertae and demonstrating the power of multiwavelength polarimetry to address this question. Furthermore, the multiwavelength flux and polarization variability, featuring an extremely prominent rise and decay of the optical polarization degree, is interpreted for the first time by the relaxation of a magnetic "spring" embedded in the newly injected plasma. This suggests that the plasma jet can maintain a predominant toroidal magnetic field component parsecs away from the central engine.</description>

      <title>Event Rate Density and Luminosity Function of Newborn-Magnetar-Driven X-Ray Transients from Neutron Star Binary Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray transients (XTs) driven by newborn magnetars from mergers of neutron star binaries (NSBs) were occasionally detected in the narrow-field {\it Chandra} Deep Field-South survey (CDF-S) and the {\it Swift}/XRT observations of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Quantifying their event rate density (ERD) and luminosity function (LF) is critical for understanding NSB coalescence and magnetar formation. Utilizing population synthesis calculations incorporating various equations of state (EoS), we derive a local ERD of $\sim 300\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ and a redshift-dependent ERD profile peaking at $z=1.81$ followed by rapid decline beyond $z \sim 4$. Constructing an XT sample based on CDF-S and {\it Swift} observations, we characterize the LF by a single power-law function at $L \leq 4.75 \times 10^{46}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$ with a slope of $-1.03$, following by a broken power-law function in which the break luminosity is $L_{\rm b} = 4.38 \times 10^{47}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$ and the slopes are $-0.28$ and $-1.66$. Based on the ERD and the LF, we estimate that the {\it Einstein Probe} ({\it EP}) detection rate is $\sim 31\;{\rm yr^{-1}}$, adopting a conservative threshold flux of $10^{-9}\;{\rm erg}\;{\rm s^{-1}}$, an luminosity range of $L \in [2\times 10^{44},2\times 10^{49}]\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$, and a correction for jet opening angle of $\sim 16^{\circ}$. This detection rate is consistent with the {\it EP} observations during its first-year operation. It is important to note that our estimation is subject to uncertainties arising from the LF derivation. Future {\it EP} observations of these XT events will be crucial in reducing these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Early evolution of super-Eddington accretion flow in tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are luminous black hole (BH) transient sources, which are detected mainly in X-ray and optical bands. It is generally believed that the X-ray emission in TDEs is produced by an accretion disc formed as the stellar debris accreted onto the central BH. The origin of the optical emission is not determined, but could be explained by the `reprocessing' model with the X-ray emission reprocessed into optical band by a surrounding optically thick envelope or outflow. In this paper, we performed radiation hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion flow with Athena++ code in the environment of TDEs, i.e., injecting a continuous mass flow rate at the circularization radius in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$ for the mass supply rate. We show that a significant fraction of the matter in the accretion inflow are blowed off forming outflow, and the properties of the outflow are viewing-angle dependent. We further calculate the emergent spectra of such an inflow/outflow system for different viewing angles with the method of Monto Carlo radiative transfer. Based on the emergent spectra, we show that the observed features of TDEs, such as the X-ray and optical luminosities, the blackbody temperature of X-ray and optical emission and the corresponding emission radii, the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity, as well as the evolution of these quantities can be explained in the framework of viewing-angle effect of super-Eddington accretion around a BH.</description>

      <title>Supernova remnants in super bubbles as cosmic ray accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are often considered as the main sites of acceleration of cosmic rays in our Galaxy, possibly up to the knee. However, their ability to accelerate particles to reach PeV energies is questionable and lacks observational evidence. Theoretical predictions suggest that only a small subclass of very young SNRs evolving in dense environments could potentially satisfy the necessary conditions to accelerate particles to PeV energies. Most such theoretical investigations are carried out either in the standard interstellar medium or in the wind of the progenitor. Since most core collapse supernovae occur in star clusters, it is important to extend such investigation to SNRs taking place in a star cluster. In this work we focus on a SNR shock propagating in the collective wind of a compact star cluster, and we study the acceleration process as a function time, with special emphasis on the maximum energy of accelerated particles. Using both analytic and numerical approaches we investigate the spectrum of accelerated particles and maximum achievable energy in the case of pre-existing turbulence in the collective wind and self-generated magnetic perturbations. We find that similar to isolated SNRs, acceleration to PeV energies is plausible only for extreme conditions achievable only in a small subset of SNRs.</description>

      <title>A simple optimisation for the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the MeerKAT radio telescope's pulsar timing array programme (MPTA) is the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of nanohertz frequencies. Evidence for such a signal was recently announced by the MPTA and several other pulsar timing array (PTA) consortia. Given an array of pulsars and an observation strategy, we consider whether small adjustments to the observing schedule can provide gains in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for a stochastic GW background signal produced by a population of massive black hole binaries. Our approach uses a greedy algorithm to reallocate available integration time between pulsars in the array. The overall time dedicated to MPTA observing is kept constant so that there is only minimal disruption to the current observation strategy. We assume a GW signal consistent with those reported. For the sake of demonstrating our method, we also make several simplifying assumptions about the noise properties of the pulsars in the MPTA. Given these assumptions, we find that small adjustments to the observing schedule can provide an increased S/N by $\approx 20\%$ for a $10\,{\rm yr}$ PTA lifespan.</description>

      <title>The Secular Periodic Evolution of X-ray Quasi-periodic Eruptions Driven by Star-disc Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the secular periodic evolution of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) for GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 assuming that they are driven by star-disc collisions. We set up numerical simulations and compared them with the observed periodic decay of $\sim -3160\pm720$ s yr$^{-1}$ in GSN069 and $\sim -370\pm40$ s yr$^{-1}$ in eRO-QPE2. We find that: (1) Stellar mass black holes are unlikely the orbiters in these two sources, as their periodic decay are on the order of $&lt;10$ s yr$^{-1}$; (2) A naked degenerate core (including white dwarf) is unlikely the orbiter in GSN069, as the decay is on the order of $&lt;200$ s yr$^{-1}$. However, it is possible in eRO-QPE2, although the required surface density of the accretion disc is relatively high (e.g., $\Sigma\gtrsim10^7\sim 10^8$ g cm$^{-2}$); (3) Both the orbiters in GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 can be solar-like main-sequence stars (MSs). However, each collision can lead to gradual ablation of the stellar envelope in the order of $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$. To reproduce the observed decay while surviving for $\gtrsim 3$ yr, the surface density of the disc needs to be within a certain range. For example, given a $1M_\odot$ MS orbiter the surface density of the disc gas should be in the range of $3\times10^5\sim 2\times10^6$g cm$^{-2}$ for GSN069 or $5\times10^4\sim 10^6$ g cm$^{-2}$ for eRO-QPE2. In both of these two sources, the MS can not survive for more than $\sim 12$ yr. We expect that future observations of these two sources can help to distinguish whether the orbiters are degenerated compact objects or gaseous stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new method to incorporate thermonuclear heating in the envelope of accreting neutron star into long term simulations of their thermal evolution. We obtain boundary conditions for the heat exchange between the envelope and the crust based on stationary models which include nuclear burning and validate these values comparing to the results of the time-dependent code \texttt{MESA}. These simple boundary conditions allow us to explore a large parameter space. We quantify the amount of heat flowing from the envelope into the crust, or viceversa, depending on the mass accretion rate, outburst duration and duty cycle, and especially crust/core physical parameters such as impurities, crustal heating, and neutrino cooling rate.</description>

      <title>Searching for supermassive black holes binaries within SRG/eROSITA-De I: Properties of the X-ray selected candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abridged: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) separated by (sub)-pc scales represent one of the latest stages of hierarchical galaxy assembly. However, many of these objects are hidden behind large columns of gas and dust at the center of galaxies and are difficult to detect. The X-ray and UV emission in these systems are predicted to vary regularly on timescales comparable to that of the orbital period of the binary. This is the first of a series of papers where we aim to find SMBHB candidates based on quasi-periodic light curves from the soft X-ray instrument eROSITA on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory and X-ray follow-up. We searched the multi-epoch SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys for extragalactic sources that show an `up-down-up-down' or `down-up-down-up' profile (from scan to scan) in their 0.2--2.3 keV flux light curves. We compiled a sample of 16 sources that are suitable for X-ray follow-up campaigns given their brightness and significant variability between bright and faint SRG/eROSITA flux levels. We triggered extensive Swift-XRT and NICER monitoring campaigns on the best SMBHB candidates to confirm or discard their tentative periodicities. Optical spectroscopic observations confirmed the nuclear and extragalactic nature of 15/16 objects and enabled single-epoch SMBH mass measurements and BPT classifications. Our most promising candidate, eRASSt J0530-4125, shows X-ray quasi-periodic variability with a typical time scale of one year in the observed frame. By stacking the X-ray observations of each source in our sample, we find that 14/15 sources can be modeled by a power law with a photon index ranging from $\Gamma\sim1.8-2.8$. Based on our selection, we estimate an optimistic upper limit on the fraction of SMBHB candidates to be $\sim 0.05$ per galaxy. We emphasize that further observational evidence is needed to confirm the SMBHB nature of our sources.</description>

      <title>A coherent radio burst from an X-ray neutron star in the Carina Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron star zoo comprises several sub-populations that range from energetic magnetars and thermally emitting X-ray neutron stars to radio-emitting pulsars. Despite studies over the last five decades, it has been challenging to obtain a clear physical link between the various populations of neutron stars, vital to constrain their formation and evolutionary pathways. Here we report the detection of a burst of coherent radio emission from a known radio-quiet, thermally emitting neutron star 2XMM J104608.7$-$594306in the Carina Nebula. The burst has a distinctive sharp rise followed by a decay made up of multiple components, which is unlike anything seen from other radio-emitting neutron stars. It suggests an episodic event from the neutron star surface, akin to transient radio emission seen from magnetars. The radio burst confirms that the X-ray source is a neutron star and suggests a new link between these apparently radio-quiet X-ray emitting sources and other transient or persistent radio-emitting neutron stars. It also suggests that a common physical mechanism for emission might operate over a range of magnetic field strengths and neutron star ages. We propose that 2XMM J104608.7$-$594306 straddles the boundary between young, energetic neutron stars and their evolved radio-emitting cousins and may bridge these two populations. The detection of such a radio burst also shows that other radio-quiet neutron stars may also emit such sporadic radio emission that has been missed by previous radio surveys and highlights the need for regular monitoring of this unique sub-population of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Constraining Scalar Charge in Neutron Stars through Gravitational Wave Signals from NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NS) offer an exceptional opportunity to investigate gravitational physics in extreme environments. In the context of alternative theories of General Relativity (GR), a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity can lead to "hairy" NS solutions with a non-zero scalar charge. As a result, binary systems containing at least one "hairy" NS can serve as probes for testing GR through observations. In this work, we analyze the gravitational wave signals from four neutron-star-black-hole (NS-BH) merger events: GW190814, GW200115, GW200105, and GW230529 examine the "hairy" NS hypothesis predicted by the luminal Horndeski theories. Our analysis constrains the scalar charge to be on the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$, with the most stringent limit arising from the recent GW230529 event. In addition, we discuss the implications of our results in relation to the scalarized NS solutions found in the literature.</description>

      <title>eROSITA view on the Halo Mass-Temperature relation. From low mass groups to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups and clusters are one of the best probes of structure formation and growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties serve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo mass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes, such as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the ICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations from self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they remain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of the scaling relations, ranging from $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} M_\odot$, remains unclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the brightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the full mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups ($10^{13}M_\odot$), as observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for optically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy groups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further validate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock eRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates that AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the intragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant changes in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can serve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the use of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies, significantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as improving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter estimates.</description>

      <title>Collisionless ablative plasma shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ablative plasma shock can emanate from the interface between a cold/dense plasma and a hot/dilute ambient plasma, where the plasma mean-free-path is much longer than the temperature gradient length. The shock is driven by thermal flux from the hot plasma into the cold plasma, primarily through tail electrons mediated by an ambipolar electric field, and it propagates into the ambient hot/dilute plasma. Since the collisional mean-free-path is usually much longer than the Debye length, the ablative plasma shock is mostly collisionless, with the shock front width set by the upstream hot plasma Debye length and the shock speed by the downstream cold plasma sound speed. The shock heating of ions is extremely efficient via collisionless mixing of upstream hot ions and downstream cold ions, both of which have been converted into shock-front-bound flows accelerated by the ambipolar electric field that has a deep potential well anchored inside the shock front.</description>

      <title>Deflection Angle in the Strong Deflection Limit and Quasinormal Modes in Stationary Axisymmetric Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a coordinate-invariant expression for the photon deflection angle in the strong deflection limit (SDL) of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. The key logarithmic-divergence coefficient is shown to depend only on quantities locally measurable by a zero-angular-momentum observer -- curvature scalars, the circumferential radius, and the proper angular velocity. The same coefficient governs the damping rate of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal limit, establishing a curvature-based, model-independent connection between QNMs and lensing in the SDL near rotating compact objects.</description>

      <title>Dirac Singleton as a Relativistic Field Beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new interpretation of Dirac singletons \cite{Dirac:1963ta}, i.e. free conformal fields in $d$ dimensions, as relativistic fields in a $d+1$-dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, that differs from the Flato-Fronsdal dipole construction in $AdS_{d+1}$ \cite{Flato:1986uh}, is proposed. The $d+1$-dimensional field is described at the level of both equations and Lagrangian. It forms an infinite-dimensional representation of the $d+1$-dimensional Lorentz group that relates fields at different space-time points. The associated well-known fact is that singleton cannot be localized at a point in ${d+1}$ dimensions, hence being unobservable via local scattering/radiation phenomena in the Standard Model ($d=3$). On the other hand, that singleton respects ${d+1}$ dimensional relativistic symmetries makes it possible to introduce its interactions with gravity and other relativistic fields in $d+1$ dimensions. It is speculated that the presence of singleton in a four-dimensional field theory with non-zero cosmological constant (dark energy) can be relevant to the dark matter phenomenon and baryon asymmetry generation.</description>

      <title>Constraining the neutron star equation of state by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling using the Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the nuclear matter equation of state within the relativistic mean field model by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling term at a fundamental level using the Bayesian analysis. We used the nuclear saturation properties and recent astrophysical observations to constrain the dense matter equation of state. We obtained about 20000 sets of equations of states out of sampling about 60 millions sets of equations of states. All 20000 equations of states satisfy nuclear matter saturation properties at saturation densities and produces high mass neutron stars. In our findings, we find that the non-zero value of isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling parameter and negative value of sigma meson self-coupling stiffen the equation of state. Our sets of equations of state produces neutron stars of mass larger than 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ to include the recent gravitational waves observation GW190419.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers help us perform parameter estimation of overlapping signals in gravitational wave detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overlapping signals represent one of the major data analysis challenges in next-generation gravitational wave detectors. We leverage Transformers and Normalizing Flows, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, to address the parameter estimation of overlapping binary black hole mergers in the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our proposed model combines a Transformer-based "Knowledge Extractor Neural Network" (KENN) with a Normalizing Flow (HYPERION) to perform rapid and unbiased inference over multiple overlapping black hole binary events. The choice of architecture leverages the strength of Transformers in capturing complex and long-range temporal structures in the strain time series data, while Normalizing Flows provide a powerful framework to sample posterior distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model over simulated gravitational wave signals, showing that it maintains the same level of accuracy regardless of the correlation level in the data. Moreover our model provides estimates of chirp mass and coalescence times within &lt;10-20% from the true simulated value. The results obtained are promising and show how this approach might represent a first step toward a deep-learning based inference pipeline for ET and other future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The Rapidly--Changing Period of the QPE Source 1ES~1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several low--mass galaxy nuclei are observed to produce quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs). Recently one of these systems, 1ES~1927+654, changed its quasiperiod drastically, from $\sim 18$ minutes to $\sim 7.1$ minutes, over a span of just two years. I suggest that this is an effect of von Zeipel -- Lidov -- Kozai (ZLK) cycles, where a more distant star orbits the QPE `binary' in which a white dwarf orbits a moderately massive central black hole. I show that in 1ES~1927+654 the white dwarf's orbital plane oscillates with angular amplitude $\simeq 71^{\circ}$ each side of the orbital plane of the distant star. This causes correlated changes of the orbital eccentricity and quasiperiod, and of the accretion luminosity driven by gravitational radiation losses. The GR luminosity has the characteristic property that it is inversely proportional to the instantaneous binary quasiperiod in all cases. The QPE system is probably just one of the effects produced by a complex infall event involving several stars. The whole system is likely to evolve rapidly, and will repay further monitoring.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators by a Statistical Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Spectro-Temporal Properties of the Black Hole Candidate Swift J151857.0-572147 during its First Outburst in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift J151857.0-572147 went through an outburst in March 2024 for the first time. Using publicly archived {\it Insight}-HXMT data, we have analyzed the timing and spectral properties of the source. We have extracted the properties of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) by fitting the power density spectrum, which inferred that the QPOs are of type C. We have detected QPOs up to $\sim48$ keV using an energy dependence study of the QPOs. High-frequency QPO is not observed during this period. We also conclude that the oscillations of the shock in transonic advective accretion flows may be the possible reason for the origin of the QPOs. In the broad energy band of $2-100$ keV, simultaneous data from the three onboard instruments of \textit{Insight}-HXMT were used to perform spectral analysis. Different combinations of models, including broken power-law, multi-color disk blackbody, interstellar absorption, non-relativistic reflection in both neutral and ionized medium, and relativistic reflection were used to understand the spectral properties during the outburst. We discovered that at the beginning of the analysis period, the source was in an intermediate state and later transitioning toward the soft state based on the spectral parameters. It has a high hydrogen column density, which could be due to some local absorption to the source.</description>

Abstract: Observations show that the X-ray emission of the accreting weakly magnetized neutron stars is polarized. Here, we develop a theoretical model, where we assume the emission of the accreting neutron star coming from the spreading layer, the extension of the boundary between the disk and the neutron star surface onto the surface. We then calculate the Stokes parameters of the emission accounting for relativistic aberration and gravitational light bending in the Schwarzschild metric. We show that regardless of the geometry, for the spreading layer, we cannot expect the polarization degree to be higher than 1.5%. Our results have implications with regard to the understanding of the X-ray polarization from weakly magnetized neutron stars observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer and the future enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission.</description>

      <title>The Role of Outflows in dynamic of Advection Dominated Accretion Flows: a Self-Similar Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of outflow on the behavior of a viscous gaseous disc around a compact object in an advection-dominated state are examined in this paper. We suppose that the flow is steady, axisymmetric, and rotating. Also, we focus on the model in which the mass, the angular momentum, and the energy can be transported outward by outflow. Similar to the pioneering studies, we consider a power-law function for mass inflow rate as $\dot{M} \propto r^s$. We assume that the power index $s$ is proportional to the dimensionless thickness $H/R$ of disc. To analyze such a system, the hydrodynamic equations have extracted in cylindrical coordinates $(r,\varphi,z)$. Then, the flow equations were vertically integrated, and a set of self-similar solutions was got in the radial direction. Our solutions include three essential parameters: $\lambda$, $f$ and $\zeta$.
  The influence of the outflow on the dynamics of the disc is investigated by the $\lambda$ parameter. The degree of advection of flow is shown by the advection parameter $f$. Also, energy extraction from the disc by the outflow is showed by $\zeta$ parameter. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation between the outflow parameters, flow advection parameter, and the temperature, thickness, and inflow-outflow rate of the disc. In addition, we explored the influence of these parameters on the power index $s$, too. The results of our study demonstrate that enhancing the outflow parameter or flow advection degree increases power index $s$, while extracting more energy through outflow decreases index $s$.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Estimation using Machine Learning and the Associated Web-App</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed at redshifts as high as 9.4, could serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases. Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods. Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles</description>

      <title>NuSTAR broadband X-ray observation of EF Eri following its reawakening into a high accretion state</title>

Abstract: We present the first NuSTAR X-ray observation of EF Eri, a well-known polar system. The NuSTAR observation was conducted in conjunction with NICER, shortly after EF Eri entered a high accretion state following an unprecedented period of low activity lasting 26 years since 1997. NuSTAR detected hard X-ray emission up to 50 keV with an X-ray flux of $1.2\times10^{-10}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($3\rm{-}50$ keV). Folded X-ray lightcurves exhibit a single peak with $\sim65\%$ spin modulation throughout the $3\rm{-}50$ keV band. We found no evidence of QPO signals at $\nu = 0.1\rm{-}100$ Hz with an upper limit on the QPO amplitude below $5\%$ ($90\%$ CL) at $\nu \sim 0.5$ Hz where the optical QPO was previously detected. Our 1-D accretion column model, called $\texttt{MCVSPEC}$, was fitted to the NuSTAR spectral data, yielding an accurate WD mass measurement of $M = (0.55\rm{-}0.63) M_\odot$. ${\tt MCVSPEC}$ accounts for radiative cooling by thermal bremsstrahlung and cyclotron emission, X-ray reflection off the WD surface, and a previously constrained range of the accretion column area. The derived WD mass range is in excellent agreement with the previous measurement of $M = (0.55\rm{-}0.65) M_\odot$ in the optical band. This demonstrates a combination of broadband X-ray spectral analysis and the ${\tt MCVSPEC}$ model that can be employed in our ongoing NuSTAR observation campaign of other polars to determine their WD masses accurately.</description>

Abstract: The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) is expected to fly in 2030 and will have the opportunity -- and the rapid near/far ultraviolet (UV) capabilities -- to glean unprecedented insight into the bright UV emission present in kilonovae like that of AT 170817gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart to binary neutron star merger GW170817. To do so, it will need to perform prompt target-of-opportunity observations following detection of binary neutron star mergers by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational observatories. We present initial simulations to develop UVEX target-of-opportunity strategies for such events and provide the community with detailed initial estimates of the prospects for and characteristics of UVEX target-of-opportunity observations following gravitational-wave events, considering fiducial scenarios for the fifth and sixth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. Additionally, in light of the relatively few binary neutron star mergers observed since GW170817, we consider variant target-of-opportunity strategies for UVEX to maximize scientific gain in the case of a lowered binary neutron star merger rate.</description>

      <title>Modified Hadronic Interactions and the future of UHECR observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data from multiple experiments suggest that the current interaction models used in Monte Carlo simulations do not correctly reproduce the hadronic interactions in air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR). We have created a large library of UHECR simulations where the interactions at the highest energies are slightly modified in various ways - but always within the constraints of the accelerator data, without any abrupt changes with energy and without assuming any specific mechanism or dramatically new physics at the ultra-high energies. Recent results of the Pierre Auger Observatory indicate a need for a change in the prediction of the models for both the muon content at ground and the depth of the maximum of longitudinal development of the shower. In our parameter space, we find combinations of modifications that are in agreement with this analysis, however a consistent description of UHECR showers remains elusive. Our library however provides a realistic representation of the freedom in the modeling of the hadronic interactions and offers an opportunity to quantify uncertainties of various predictions. This can be particularly valuable for the design of future observatories where hadronic models are often used as input for the prediction of the performance. We demonstrate this powerful capability on several selected examples.</description>

      <title>High energy extragalactic multimessenger backgrounds from starburst and dead galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starburst galaxies are $\gamma$-ray sources. Canonically, their emission is driven by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) interacting with interstellar gas, forming $\gamma$-rays via the decay of neutral pions. Charged pions are also formed in this process. They decay into secondary leptons, including electrons and neutrinos. Starburst galaxies are therefore also expected to be neutrino sources, and their high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission may include a secondary leptonic component. Leptonic $\gamma$-rays may also originate from electrons directly energized by shocks within the interstellar medium of galaxies, or from pulsars and their surrounding halos. In the Milky Way, pulsars/pulsar halos are the dominant $\gamma$-ray source class. They are associated with stellar remnants or old stellar populations, and are presumably abundant in old galaxies. In this work, we show that the collective high-energy emission from galaxies can account for only a fraction of extragalactic neutrinos, but can form a major component of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. Contrary to the traditional view, a substantial fraction of this radiation may originate from leptonic processes, including from old, quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to Neutrino-cooled Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in a tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a massive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a non-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended accretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star. The impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by approximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the accretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these results with more general initial conditions and describing the main features of the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of hypercritically accreting NSs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of binary extreme-mass-ratio inspiral systems and their gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A binary extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (b-EMRI) is a hierarchical triple system consisting of a stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) orbiting a central Kerr supermassive black hole (SMBH). Although predicted by several astrophysical models, b-EMRIs pose a challenge in waveform modeling due to their complex three-body dynamics and strong relativistic effects. Here we take advantage of the hierarchical nature of b-EMRI systems to transform the internal motion of the small binary into global trajectories around the SMBH. This allows us to use black hole perturbation theory to calculate both the low-frequency gravitational waveform due to its EMRI nature and the high-frequency waveform generated by the inner motion of the BBH. When the inner binary's separation vanishes, our calculation recovers the standard relativistic adiabatic EMRI waveform. Furthermore, by including the high-frequency perturbation, we find a correction to the waveform as large as the adiabatic order when the frequency matches the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the SMBH, therefore supporting an earlier proof-of-concept study claiming that the small BBH can resonantly excite the QNMs of the SMBH. More importantly, we find that b-EMRIs can evolve faster than regular EMRIs due to this resonant dissipation through the high-frequency modes. These characteristics distinguish b-EMRI waveform templates from regular EMRI templates for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Individual Neutrino Masses From a Supernova</title>

Abstract: A nearby supernova will carry an unprecedented wealth of information about astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. Because supernova are fundamentally neutrino driven phenomenon, our knowledge about neutrinos -- particles that remain quite elusive -- will increase dramatically with such a detection. One of the biggest open questions in particle physics is related to the masses of neutrinos. Here we show how a galactic supernova provides information about the masses of each of the three mass eigenstates \emph{individually}, at some precision, and is well probed at JUNO. This information comes from several effects including time delay and the MSW effect within the supernova. The time delay feature is strongest during a sharp change in the flux such as the neutronization burst; additional information may also come from a QCD phase transition in the supernova or if the supernova forms a black hole. We consider both standard cases as dictated by local oscillation experiments as well as new physics motivated scenarios where neutrino masses may differ across the galaxy.</description>

      <title>On the Orbital Effects of Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei: Tidal Disruption Events and Ejected Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense stellar clusters surround the supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Interactions within the cluster can alter the stellar orbits, occasionally driving a star into the SMBH's tidal radius where it becomes ruptured, or expelling a star from the nuclear cluster. This proof-of-concept study examines the orbital effects of stellar collisions using a semi-analytic model. Both low and high speed collisions occur in the SMBH's sphere of influence. We find that collisions can place stars on nearly radial orbits. Depositing stars within the tidal radius, collisions may drive the disruption of stars with unusual masses and structures: depending on the nature of the collision, the star could be the product of a recent merger, or it could have lost its outer layers in a previous high speed impact, appearing as a stripped star. We also find that high speed collisions near the periapsis of an eccentric orbit can unbind stars from the SMBH. However, dissipation during these high-speed collisions can substantially reduce the number of unbound stars achieved in our simulations. We conclude that tidal disruption events (TDEs) and ejected stars, even in the hypervelocity regime, are plausible outcomes of stellar collisions, though their frequency in a three-dimensional nuclear star cluster are uncertain. Future work will address the rates and properties of these events.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR bounds on radiatively decaying particles from M82</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions and other putative feebly interacting particles (FIPs) with a mass of tens to several hundreds of keVs can be produced in stellar cores with a Lorentz boost factor $E_a/m_a\lesssim 10$. Thus, starburst galaxies such as M82 are efficient factories of slow axions. Their decay $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ would produce a large flux of X-ray photons, peaking around $100$ keV and spread around the galaxy by an angle that can be relatively large. We use observations of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission to show that the absence of these features can constrain $30-500$ keV axion masses into uncharted regions for axion-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. Our argument can be applied to other heavy FIPs and astrophysical sources that are hot enough to produce them, yet cold enough to avoid large boost factors which slow down the decay.</description>

      <title>Novel electrically charged wormhole, black hole and black bounce exact solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic exploration of exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity, particularly those related to cosmic acceleration and dark matter. We examine configurations characterized by a zero scalar potential under spherical symmetry, and present solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. A diverse set of solutions emerges, including traversable wormholes, black holes with double horizons, and ``black universe'' models in which spacetime beyond the horizon leads to an expanding cosmological solution rather than a singularity. Each configuration is categorized according to the properties of the scalar field, with an in-depth analysis of the horizon and throat structures, asymptotic behaviour, and singularities. These findings underscore the versatility of HMPG in capturing complex gravitational phenomena and broadens the scope of the theory, offering a robust framework for modelling gravitational phenomena across a range of astrophysical contexts. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data, such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Solutions of Evolving Nuclear Star Clusters with Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo Dynamical Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently developed a Monte-Carlo method (GNC) that can simulate the dynamical evolution of a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC) with a massive black hole (MBH), where the two-body relaxations can be solved by the Fokker-Planck equations in energy and angular momentum space. Here we make a major update of GNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that we can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the MBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass growth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous studies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\sim 17t_{\rm rh}$ by GNC, where $t_{\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study the cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH assuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars (e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the simulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by galaxies. Such scenario is possible to produce MBHs with mass $10^5\sim 10^7\,M_\odot$ for NSCs with stellar mass of $10^6\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$. In Milky-Way's NSC, to grow MBH up to $4\times 10^6\,M_\odot$, its size needs to be $\sim 1.7$ times more compact in early universe than the current value. MBHs with current masses $&gt;6\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$ seem difficult to explain by loss-cone accretion alone, and thus may require other additional accretion channels, such as gas accretion.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle.'' The governing equations (involving general relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source -- it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is the cornerstone of relativity theory. Its implications have been verified experimentally with a variety of approaches. The detection of a muon at extremely high energy detected by the ARCA detector in the Mediterranean sea, the most energetic particle directly measured up to date, allows to put additional constraints on Lorentz non-invariant theories. The prediction of some of those theories is that the lifetimes of particles in the laboratory frame 'decrease' rather than 'increase' with increasing $\gamma$. In this frame the sheer fact that the muon traversed the whole ARCA detector puts a lower limit on the muon lifetime in the laboratory frame, that implies upper limits on Lorentz violating parameters.</description>

      <title>Lensing and wave optics in the strong field of a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14073</link>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in magnetars: Exploring type-I and type-II states in toroidal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A characteristic optical variability time scale in jetted active galactic nuclei: a large gamma-ray emission sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variability mechanisms from jetted AGNs are still under debate. Here the damped random walk (DRW) model, implemented through Gaussian Processe (GPs), is used to fit the $ZTF$ long-term optical light curves of 1684 $\gamma$-ray emission jetted AGNs. This analysis yields one of the largest samples with characteristic optical variability timescales for jetted AGNs. A single DRW model from GPs can fit the optical light curve of most jetted AGNs well/potentially well, while there are still some jetted AGNs whose light curve can not be fitted well by a single DRW model. After the jet power, proxied by gamma-ray luminosity, is introduced as a new parameter, new relationships among intrinsic variability time scales, black hole mass and jet power are discovered for efficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.29^{+0.06}_{-0.06}}P_{\rm jet}^{-0.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.09~dex) and for inefficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.07}}P_{\rm jet}^{0.37^{+0.11}_{-0.11}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.14~dex), respectively. Our results support that the optical variability of jetted AGNs with efficient accretion may originate within the standard accretion disk at UV emitting radii similar to non-jetted AGNs, and is directly related to the acceleration of shock in the jet and then enhanced through the beaming effect in beamed AGNs. For the jetted AGNs with inefficient accretion, the intrinsic timescale is consistent with the escape timescale of electrons.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of the HESS J1731-347 Compact Object via the Karmarkar Condition in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the light HESS J1731-347 compact object (of known stellar mass and radius) within Einstein's General Relativity imposing the Karmarkar condition in gravity for anisotropic stars. The three free parameters of the analytic solution are determined imposing the matching conditions at the surface of the star for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that the solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. Furthermore, we study the radial oscillation modes, and we compare to the ones corresponding to an isotropic star modeled by the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. A comparison between the large frequency separations is made as well.</description>

      <title>Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using orbit-averaged evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary formed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa. Knowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular momentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to create a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The spin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and spin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency, eccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian parametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the leading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include the quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in the fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and Yunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various features of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession parameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the dependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the transition point from one spin morphology to another can depend nonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given morphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the instantaneous eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>
