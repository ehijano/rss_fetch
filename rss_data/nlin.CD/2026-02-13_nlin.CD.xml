      <title>Metastable Dynamical Computing with Energy Landscapes: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Potential-energy gating for robust state estimation in bistable stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p &lt; 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.</description>

      <title>Controlling Dynamical Systems into Unseen Target States Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10251</link>

Abstract: We present a novel, model-free, and data-driven methodology for controlling complex dynamical systems into previously unseen target states, including those with significantly different and complex dynamics. Leveraging a parameter-aware realization of next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC), our approach accurately predicts system behavior in unobserved parameter regimes, enabling control over transitions to arbitrary target states utilizing a new prediction evaluation and selection scheme. Crucially, this includes states with dynamics that differ fundamentally from known regimes, such as shifts from periodic to intermittent or chaotic behavior. The method's parameter awareness facilitates non-stationary control with which control scenarios are generated and evaluated on the basis of predefined control objective. In addition to proving the method for transient-free control to extrapolated chaotic target states over transition times, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness on a nonlinear power system model. Our method successfully navigates transitions even in scenarios where system collapse is observed frequently, while ensuring fast transitions and avoiding prolonged transient behavior. By extending the applicability of machine learning-based control mechanisms to previously inaccessible target dynamics, the methodology opens the door to new control applications while maintaining exceptional efficiency.</description>

      <title>Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility for physics-inspired approaches to combinatorial optimization.</description>
