      <title>Room-Temperature Disorder-Driven Nonlinear Transport in Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported nonlinear signals in topological materials up to room temperature. Here we show that this response stems from extrinsic spin-orbit contributions to \textit{both} impurity and phonon scattering. While skew scattering dominates at low temperatures, the side jump contribution $\propto \tau/\tau_\beta$, where $\tau$, $\tau_\beta$ are the momentum and skew scattering times respectively. Consequently side jump exhibits a weak temperature dependence and remains sizable at room temperature. Our results provide a roadmap for engineering nonlinear transport at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Spin Currents in Rashba Altermagnets: From Equilibrium to Nonlinear Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate equilibrium (background), linear, and nonlinear spin currents in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled altermagnet systems, using a modified spin current operator that includes anomalous velocity from non-zero Berry curvature. The background spin current, stemming from spin-orbit coupling and modulated by the altermagnet term ($t_j$), exhibits in-plane polarization, increases linearly with Fermi energy ($\epsilon_F$), and is enhanced by both the altermagnet ($t_j$) and the Rashba parameter ($\lambda$). Linear spin current is always transverse with out-of-plane polarization and can be viewed as Spin Hall current, primarily driven by band velocity, with $t_j$ enabling a band-induced contribution (previously absent in simple Rashba systems ($t_j=0$)). This highlights altermagnet system as a promising source of spin Hall current generation. For linear spin Hall current, its band contribution's magnitude increases linearly with $\epsilon_F$, while the magnitude of anomalous component saturates at higher $\epsilon_F$. Further, the magnitude of spin Hall current is enhanced by $t_j$ but reduced by $\lambda$. Nonlinear spin currents feature both longitudinal and transverse components with in-plane polarization. Both the nonlinear longitudinal spin current from band velocity and the nonlinear transverse spin current from anomalous velocity initially decrease with $\epsilon_F$ before saturating at higher $\epsilon_F$. Importantly, $t_j$ reduces these currents while $\lambda$ enhances them. Meanwhile, the nonlinear transverse current from band velocity increases and then saturates with $\epsilon_F$, enhanced by $\lambda$ and showing non-monotonic variation with $t_j$. These findings highlight the tunability of spin current behavior through Rashba and altermagnet parameters, offering insights for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Movable Dirac Points with Ferroelectrics: Kink States and Berry Curvature Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac states and Dirac points with linear dispersion are the hallmark of graphene, topological insulators, semimetals, and superconductors. Lowering a symmetry by the ferroelectric polarization opens the gap in Dirac points and introduces finite Berry curvature. Combining this with Dirac points detached from high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone offers additional ways to tailor topological properties. We explore this concept by studying topological phenomena emerging in 2D materials with movable Dirac points and broken out-of-plane mirror reflection. The resulting topological kink states and Berry curvature dipoles are changed by movable 2D Dirac points with experimental signatures in electrical conductance and second-harmonic nonlinear Hall conductivity. We identify materials platforms where our predictions can be realized and support that with the first-principles results for Cl$_2$Rh$_2$S$_2$-GeS junction.</description>

      <title>Resolving Andreev spin qubits in germanium-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) are a promising platform for quantum information processing which benefit from both the small footprint of semiconducting spin qubits and the long range connectivity of superconducting qubits. While state-of-the-art experiments have developed ASQs in InAs nanowires, these realizations are coherence-time limited by nuclear magnetic noise which cannot be removed by isotopic purification. In Ge-based Josephson junctions, which can be isotopically purified, Andreev states have been experimentally observed but spin-resolved Andreev states remain elusive. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the geometry of the Josephson junction can limit the qubit frequency to values below typical experimental temperatures and render the ASQ effectively invisible. ASQs could be experimentally resolved by judiciously choosing the geometry of the junction and filling of the underlying Ge. Our comprehensive study of ASQ frequency on in situ and ex situ experimentally controllable parameters provides design guidance of Ge-based Josephson junctions and paves the way towards realization of high-coherence ASQs.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Diffusion of Chiral Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian dynamics of chiral matter in chiral environment may give rise to emergent phenomena that could not be observed in achiral environment. Here, we report the asymmetric diffusion of chiral skyrmions in two chambers separated by a chiral gate. The topology-determined Brownian gyromotion of skyrmions could lead to effective interactions between skyrmions and chamber walls with a sense of clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation. By fabricating a chiral gate separating two chambers, skyrmions could demonstrate asymmetric diffusion through the gate to approach a nonequilibrium state before reaching the thermal equilibrium. We focus on the asymmetric diffusion of skyrmions that depends on the gate chirality and opening width. Although the simulated diffusion of skyrmions is affected by the skyrmion density, which varies with time due to the diffusion and annihilation, the simulated outcomes are generally in line with simple theories assuming time-independent diffusion rates. Our results uncover asymmetric diffusive behaviors of chiral skyrmions interacting with chiral nanostructures, which will appeal to the wide audience interested in hard condensed matter systems, magnetism, active matter, and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Singular flat bands in three dimensions: Landau level spreading, quantum geometry, and Weyl reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate three-dimensional singular flat band systems, focusing on their quantum geometric properties and response to external magnetic fields. As a representative example, we study the pyrochlore lattice, which hosts a pair of degenerate flat bands touching a dispersive band. We derive a three-orbital effective continuum model that captures the essential features near the band-touching point. Within this framework, we identify the point-like topological singularity on a planar manifold defined by the degenerate flat band eigenvectors. This singularity strongly influences the quantum geometry and results in a characteristic Landau level structure, where the levels spread over a finite energy range. We show that this structure reflects the underlying band reconstruction due to the orbital Zeeman effect, which lifts the flat band degeneracy and induces the Weyl-semimetal-like dispersion near the singularity. Our analysis reveals that the range of Landau level spreading is proportional to the quantum metric of each Zeeman-split band. We further demonstrate that adding a small dispersion via longer-range . Finally, we show that our approach extends naturally to systems with higher orbital angular momentum, indicating the robustness of these features in a broad class of three-dimensional flat band models.</description>

      <title>Hetero-Orbital Two-Component Fractional Quantum Hall States in Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional electron system exposed to a strong magnetic field produces a plethora of strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, the complex topological orders of which are revealed through exotic emergent particles, such as composite fermions, fractionally charged Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological electric circuits with projective symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological insulators have attracted considerable attention due to their distinctive energy band characteristics and promising applications. Here, we systematically investigate non-Hermitian M\"obius insulators and graphene-like topological semimetals from the projected symmetry and realize their corresponding topological phenomena in an electric circuit-based framework. By introducing a nonreciprocal hopping term consisting of negative impedance converters into a two-dimensional electric circuit, we establish an experimental platform that effectively demonstrates that introducing non-Hermitian terms significantly enhances the energy localization of topological edge states, which originate from the non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, a thorough comparison of experimental measurements with numerical simulations validates the robustness and reliability of our electric circuit structure. This work not only reveals the physical properties of non-Hermitian topological materials but also provides valuable theoretical and experimental guidance for the implementation of topological circuits and the design of radiofrequency devices in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism is a rapidly developing field within magnetic materials research, where exploiting the third dimension unlocks opportunities for innovative applications in areas such as sensing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing. Among various fabrication techniques, focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID) offers high flexibility in creating complex 3D nanostructures with sub-100 nm resolution. A key challenge in the development of 3D nanomagnets is the ability to locally control the magnetic configuration, which is essential to achieve desired functionalities. In this work, the magnetization reversal mechanism of a three-dimensional nanoarchitecture fabricated using focused electron beam-induced deposition is investigated by combining direct observation via scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with finite element micromagnetic simulations. In particular, our investigation shows that the magnetization of the components of a three-dimensional Co3 Fe tetrapod can be reversed individually and sequentially. Finally, it is demonstrated that complete control and reconfigurability of the system can be achieved by tuning the direction of the applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Signature of current-induced nuclear spin polarization in (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems with spin-momentum locking, such as the surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators, a charge current is spin-polarized and spin-flip interactions between electron and nuclear spins can transfer this polarization to the nuclear spin system. When a nonzero bias voltage is applied, the nuclear polarization reaches a steady-state value. This polarization emerges as an effective in-plane magnetic field acting on electrons, called the Overhauser field, which causes an offset in-plane magnetoresistance perpendicular to the current, visible in experiments. The in-plane offset is measured in the three-dimensional topological insulator \bsttight, and the magnitude of the magnetic field offset is compared to the Overhauser field. We attribute the observed magnetic field offset to current-induced nuclear polarization in \bsttight, which forms an important step towards experimentally realizing an entropic inductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-subband plasmon (MSP) modes in heavily doped InAs/GaSb broken-gap quantum wells grown via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) are investigated. An $8$-band $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ semiclassical model accurately predicts ellipsometric spectra, reflecting strong subband hybridization and non-parabolicity. In contrast, single-band plasmon models show qualitative discrepancies with experiment, even with adjusted effective masses. These findings highlight the potential of broken-gap wells for quantum technologies leveraging interband coupling and wavefunction hybridization.</description>

      <title>Super-diffusive sub-picosecond extraction of hot carriers in black phosphorous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harvesting hot carriers before they lose energy to the lattice is a critical route toward surpassing the conventional thermodynamic limit in optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion. However, photocurrent from such hot carriers has remained challenging to directly detect because they equilibrate on picosecond timescales, outpacing conventional electronic measurement. Here, by employing terahertz electronics with sub-picosecond temporal resolution, we directly monitor hot-carrier-driven O-E conversion in black phosphorus (BP). Photoexcitation near the metal contact under zero source-drain bias generates an ultrafast photocurrent with a decay time of ~400 fs, orders of magnitude faster than the typical sub-nanosecond energy relaxation in BP, demonstrating a measured 3 dB bandwidth of 260 GHz with an intrinsic limit of ~600 GHz. Notably, this photocurrent flows via energetic holes toward the contact electrode, regardless of the equilibrium carrier type, revealing a super-diffusive hot-carrier extraction mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the ultrafast hot-carrier contribution can coexist with the much slower cold-carrier contribution based on the photovoltaic effect, demonstrating that hot carriers can be harvested without discarding lower-energy carriers. These findings highlight the potential of sub-picosecond hot-carrier extraction to expand the O-E conversion bandwidth without sacrificing efficiency, bridging fundamental hot-carrier physics with ultrahigh-speed technological applications.</description>

      <title>High yield, low disorder Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubit devices manufactured in a BiCMOS pilot line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with semiconductor spin qubits in Si/SiGe heterostructures relies on the integration of a large number of identical devices, a feat achievable through a scalable (Bi)CMOS manufacturing approach. To this end, both the gate stack and the Si/SiGe heterostructure must be of high quality, exhibiting uniformity across the wafer and consistent performance across multiple fabrication runs. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of Si/SiGe heterostructures and gate stacks, fabricated in an industry-standard 200 mm BiCMOS pilot line. We evaluate the homogeneity and reproducibility by probing the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the shallow silicon quantum well through magnetotransport characterization of Hall bar-shaped field-effect transistors at 1.5 K. Across all the probed wafers, we observe minimal variation of the 2DEG properties, with an average maximum mobility of $(4.25\pm0.17)\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{2}$/Vs and low percolation carrier density of $(5.9\pm0.18)\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ evidencing low disorder potential in the quantum well. The observed narrow statistical distribution of the transport properties highlights the reproducibility and the stability of the fabrication process. Furthermore, wafer-scale characterization of a selected individual wafer evidenced the homogeneity of the device performances across the wafer area. Based on these findings, we conclude that our material and processes provide a suitable platform for the development of scalable, Si/SiGe-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Fully Tunable Strong Spin-Orbit Interactions in Light Hole Germanium Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is a fundamental component for electrically driven spin qubits and hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems. In particular, Rashba SOI (RSOI) is a key mechanism enabling all-electrical spin manipulation schemes. However, in common planar systems, RSOI is weak because of the small mixing between heavy holes (HH) and light holes (LH), and instead relies on complex strain and interface phenomena that are hard to reliably harness in experiment. Here, MOS-like epitaxial Ge on relaxed \GeSn{} is introduced and shown to exhibit an inherently large, highly gate-tunable RSOI that is compatible with both spin qubits and hybrid devices. This large RSOI is a consequence of the LH-like ground state in Ge. Notably, the built-in asymmetry of the device causes the RSOI to completely vanish at specific gate fields, effectively acting as an on/off SOI switch. The LH $g$-tensor is less anisotropic than that of state-of-the-art HH qubits, alleviating precise magnetic field orientation requirements. The large in-plane $g$-factor also facilitates the integration of superconductors. Moreover, the out-of-plane $g$-factor is strongly gate-tunable and completely vanishes at specific gate fields. Thus, this material system combines the large RSOI with the scalability of planar devices, paving the way towards robust spin qubit applications and enabling access to new regimes of complex spin physics.</description>

      <title>Universal cooling of quantum systems via randomized measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11964v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the design of cooling protocols requires knowledge of the system's spectrum. In contrast, cooling processes in nature occur whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. But how does nature know how to cool quantum systems? Here we address this question by mimicking a natural cold bath with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state and interact with the system sequentially for a specified time before being discarded. This protocol is equivalent to quantum measurements without keeping the measurement readouts. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without prior knowledge of the system's details when the interactions between the system and the meters, as well as the level splittings of the meters, are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the rotating-wave approximation becomes valid, ensuring that resonant energy-exchange processes, which lead to cooling, dominate over heating. This demonstrates that robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems can be achieved through generic, structure-independent protocols. Our findings thus offer a versatile universal framework for engineering, controlling, and manipulating quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for the purposes of quantum information processing and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Weyl semimetal engineering by symmetry control in NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of Weyl points in an inversion symmetry-breaking 1T-NiTe$_2$ system. Through first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory combined with tight-binding methods, distinct number of Weyl crossings arise under an appropriate symmetry breaking. We identify three sets of Weyl points by breaking the inversion symmetry in NiTe$_2$, resulting in a total of 28 Weyl crossings. The first set comes from the Dirac semimetal, whereas the other two additional sets depend on the weight of the symmetry breaking. The topological characteristics of the Weyl semimetals have been investigated by computing the evolution of Wannier charge centers, providing their chiralities. Additionally, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been shown by computing the Fermi arcs. Our results provide a way for manipulating and creating distinct sets of Weyl points with appropriate external control, which can be valuable for applications in Weyltronics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Chern metal in a moir\'e Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern metal is a two-dimensional metallic state of matter carrying chiral edge states. It can emerge as a doped Chern insulator, but theoretical studies have also predicted its emergence near a Kondo breakdown separating a metallic chiral spin liquid and a heavy Fermi liquid in a frustrated lattice. To date, the latter exotic scenario has not been realized. Here, we report the observation of a Chern metal at the onset of the magnetic Kondo breakdown in a frustrated moir\'e Kondo lattice--angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. The state is compressible and is manifested by a nearly quantized Hall resistance but a finite longitudinal resistance that arises from a bad metallic bulk. The state also separates an itinerant and a heavy Fermi liquid and appears far away from the band inversion critical point of the material, thus ruling out its origin from simply doping a Chern insulator. We demonstrate the presence of a chiral edge state by nonlocal transport measurements and current-induced quantum anomalous Hall breakdown. Magnetic circular dichroism measurements further reveal a magnetization plateau for the Chern metal before a metamagnetic transition at the Kondo breakdown. Our results open an opportunity for moir\'e engineering of exotic quantum phases of matter through the close interplay between band topology and Kondo interactions.</description>

      <title>Resonant helical dichroism in twisted dielectric metastructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular dichroism, arising from interactions with light fields of opposite spin angular momentum, has become a fundamental tool for molecular characterization. Meanwhile, helical dichroism (HD) - the dichroic response to vortex beams carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) - offers an alternative approach for probing chiral molecules and photonic structures. Previous demonstrations of HD have been limited to non-resonant light-matter interactions with chiral micro- and nanostructures, leaving the realization of resonance helical dichroism largely unexplored. Here, we present the design and implementation of twisted dielectric metastructures, composed of an array of rotated silicon trimer nanostructures harnessing nonlocal photonic modes with a high quality factor of several dozen that enable strong resonant HD for OAM values up to $10$. We experimentally demonstrate resonantly enhanced HD for strongly focused OAM beams with the magnitude of topological charges from $1$ to $3$. Our findings pave the way for resonant nanophotonics involving OAM beams, unlocking the full potential of structured light for applications in molecular sensing, optical imaging, nonlinear optics, and optical data storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral localizer is a predictive framework for the computation of topological invariants of natural and artificial materials. Here, three crucial improvements on the criterion for the validity of the framework are reported: first, merely a properly defined local spectral gap of the Hamiltonian is required, second, only relative bounds on the Hamiltonian and its noncommutative derivative are relevant, and, third, the numerical constant in a tapering estimate is improved. These developments further stress the local nature of the spectral localizer framework, enabling more precise predictions in heterostructures, aperiodic, and disordered systems. Moreover, these results strengthen the bounds on the spectral localizer's spectral flow when crossing topological phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Dressed States of a Quantum Four-Level System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we experimentally and theoretically study the dressed-state emission of the biexciton-exciton cascade in a semiconductor quantum dot under pulsed, resonant, two-photon excitation. Building on the well-characterized steady-state dressed emission of the four-level system, we examine its dynamic counterpart under pulsed, resonant excitation, addressing both experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Here we report several sidebands emerging from the biexciton-to-exciton transition, whose number and spectral width depend on the excitation pulse duration and the effective pulse area, while no sidebands emerge from the exciton-to-ground-state transition. Since the biexciton state population follows a nonlinear pulse area function, sidebands with a small spectral nonlinearity result. Detuning- and time-dependent measurements provide deeper insight into the emission properties of the dressed states. They show that side peak emission only occurs in the presence of the excitation pulse. Moreover, when the system is excited by a Gaussian-shaped laser pulse, side peak emission takes place sequentially.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Optical Hall Effect in 2D Weyl Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of interplay between the geometric nature of Bloch electrons and transverse responses under strong field offers new opportunities for optoelectronic applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the strong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using time-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored focusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to nonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and energy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents, with the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the Weyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband contributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between interband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a comprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional calculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the interband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be crucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG associated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds immense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl semimetal.</description>

      <title>Antichiral surface states and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger physics in rutile altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study surface states and domain wall bound states in altermagnets using a rutile-lattice tight-binding model of electrons coupled to a N\'eel order. We discover that two symmetry-protected Weyl nodal lines in the bulk band structure can give rise to unconventional anti-chiral surface states -- surface states from opposite surfaces propagate in a \emph{parallel} manner, as opposed to the anti-parallel manner for the more conventional chiral surface states. We also find that the anti-chiral surface states can be turned into chiral surface states upon changing the surface termination. The origin of the surface states, the dependence on the surface termination, and key features of domain wall bound states are explained using a map from the altermagnet to a family of a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) chain and the associated bulk-boundary correspondence. Our work reveals rutile altermagnets as a promising candidate among very few quantum materials that can support anti-chiral surface states.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have achieved linear arrays exceeding ten qubits. Moving to two-dimensional (2D) qubit arrays is a critical next step to advance towards fault-tolerant implementations, but it poses substantial fabrication challenges, particularly because enabling control of nearest-neighbor entanglement requires the incorporation of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in the qubit architecture. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all adjacent dots. The device is characterized at 4.2 K, where we demonstrate the formation and isolation of double-dot and triple-dot configurations. We show control of all nearest-neighbor tunnel couplings spanning up to 30 decades per volt through the interstitial exchange gates and use advanced modeling tools to estimate the exchange interactions that could be realized among qubits in this architecture. These results represent a significant step towards the development of 2D MOS quantum processors compatible with foundry manufacturing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly efficient torques generated by 3D topological insulators make them a favourable platform for faster and more efficient magnetic memory devices. Recently, research into harnessing orbital angular momentum in orbital torques has received significant attention. Here we study the orbital Hall effect in topological insulators. We find that the bulk states give rise to a sizeable orbital Hall effect that is up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall effect in topological insulators. This is partially because the orbital angular momentum that each conduction electron carries is up to an order of magnitude larger than the $\hbar/2$ carried by its spin. Our results imply that the large torques measured in topological insulator/ferromagnet devices can be further enhanced through careful engineering of the heterostructure to optimise orbital-to-spin conversion.</description>

Abstract: The layer-resolved quantum transport response of a twisted bilayer graphene device is investigated by driving a current through the bottom layer and measuring the induced voltage in the top layer. Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a longitudinal counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, lattice relaxation and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.</description>

Abstract: The scattering of lattice excitations (phonons) with the photoexcited charge carriers is of a major concern in optoelectronic devices. Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton-phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton-phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the 4th order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.</description>

Abstract: Gapless topological phases have attracted significant interest across both quantum and classical systems owing to their novel physics and promising applications. However, the search for ideal gapless topological nodes inside a clear bandgap is still lacking in elastic systems. The degenerate points are always hidden in the trivial bulk bands due to the intricate elastic modes involved. Here, we find a topological semi-complete bandgap in a three-dimensional elastic truss lattice by tuning a supporting rod, which exhibits a complete bandgap except for the inevitable topological degenerate points. Furthermore, we experimentally map the topological semi-complete bandgap and the inside nontrivial surface state arcs with a scanning laser vibrometer. The introduced scheme provides a systematic approach for the idealization of semi-complete bandgaps and thus may significantly advance the practical utility of topological phases in mechanical engineering domains.</description>

      <title>Measuring Decoherence Due to Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations</title>

Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations--which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter--can lead to observable irreversible decoherence if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15400</link>

Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-interband hybridization and anomalous production of hot electrons in aluminum nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling typically occurs between two separate objects or between an object and its environment (such as an atom and a cavity). However, it can also occur between two different excitations within the same object, a situation that has been much less studied. In this study, we observe strong coupling between localized surface plasmon resonances and the interband transition in aluminum nanorods, as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and corroborated with numerical simulations. Strong coupling is observed between the interband transition and multiple orders of the surface plasmon mode, including dark ones. We also obtain experimental maps of the hybrid modes at the nanoscale. In each case, the associated Rabi energy, which corresponds to the energy splitting between the two polaritonic branches, is obtained. Finally, a dedicated numerical model was employed to calculate the hot electron generation rate in the nanorods. The calculations demonstrate that efficient generation of hot electrons can be achieved in the near-infrared region, when the interband transition is strongly coupled with a plasmon resonance. This high generation rate stems from the hybrid nature of the mode, as its plasmonic component provides a high absorption cross-section, while the IT part ensures efficient conversion to hot electrons. Consequently, aluminum nanorods represent an efficient source of hot electrons in the visible and near-infrared regions, with potential applications in local photochemistry, photodetection, and solar energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle-induced decoherence of a driven superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</description>
