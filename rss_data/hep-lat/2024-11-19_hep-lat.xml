      <title>Stochastic quantization and diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical review of the possible connection between the stochastic quantization in physics and the diffusion models in machine learning. For machine-learning applications, the denoising diffusion model has been established as a successful technique, which is formulated in terms of the stochastic differential equation (SDE). In this review, we focus on an SDE approach used in the score-based generative modeling. Interestingly, the evolution of the probability distribution is equivalently described by a particular class of SDEs, and in a particular limit, the stochastic noises can be eliminated. Then, we turn to a similar mathematical formulation in quantum physics, that is, the stochastic quantization. We make a brief overview on the stochastic quantization using a simple toy model of the one-dimensional integration. The analogy between the diffusion model and the stochastic quantization is clearly seen in this concrete example. Finally, we discuss how the sign problem arises in the toy model with complex parameters. The origin of the difficulty is understood based on the Lefschetz thimble analysis. We point out that the SDE is not invariant under the variable change which induces a kernel and a special choice of the kernel guided by the Lefschetz thimble analysis can reduce the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the $\eta_c\eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ s-wave scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the s-wave scattering length in the $0^+$ sector of $\eta_c\eta_c$ and the $2^+$ sector of $J/\psi J/\psi$ using three $N_f=2$ twisted mass gauge ensembles with the lattice spacing $a=0.0667,0.085,0.098$ fm, respectively. The scattering lengths are extracted using the conventional L{\"u}scher finite size method. We observe sizable discretization effects and the results after a continuum extrapolation are $a^{0^+}_{\eta_c\eta_c}=-0.104(09)$ fm and $a^{2^+}_{J/\psi J/\psi}=-0.165(16)$ fm. Our results indicate that the interaction between the two respective charmonia are repulsive in nature in both cases.</description>

      <title>QED 5-loop on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the result of the numerical lattice computation of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment in QED up to five loops. We concentrate on the contributions from diagrams without lepton loops, which are the most difficult part of the calculation in the Feynman diagram method while the lattice formulation is the easiest. Good agreement with the results of the Feynman diagram method is observed.</description>

      <title>Topology in 2D non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two dimensions, $U(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a non-trivial topological structure, while $SU(N_c)$ theories are topologically trivial. Hence, for $G = U(N_c)$ the phase space is divided into topological sectors, characterized by a topological index (a.k.a. ``topological charge''). These sectors are separated by action barriers, which diverge if the lattice spacing is taken small, resulting in an algorithmic problem known as ``topological freezing''. We study these theories in various box sizes and at various couplings. With the help of gradient flow we derive instanton-like solutions for 2D $U(N_c)$ theory with a specific focus on the case of $N_c = 2$.</description>

      <title>Computing $1/m_Q$ and $1/m_Q^2$ corrections to the static potential with lattice gauge theory using gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present selected preliminary lattice gauge theory results for $O(1/m_Q)$ and $O(1/m_Q^2)$ corrections to the static potential. These results are based on Wilson loops with two field strength insertions, which we renormalize using gradient flow. We explore tree level improvement to reduce systematic errors in the Wilson loops due to the finite lattice spacing and flow time, in particular at small temporal and spatial separations.</description>

      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon at the physical pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon using $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of staggered quarks with masses tuned to their physical values. Our final result, in the continuum limit, reads $a_{\mu}^{\mathrm{hlbl}} = 125.5(11.6)_{\mathrm{stat}}(0.4)_{\mathrm{syst}} \times 10^{-11}$ where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. Light, strange and charm-quark contributions are considered. In addition to the connected and leading disconnected contributions, we also include an estimate of the sub-leading disconnected diagrams. Our result is compatible with previous lattice QCD and data-driven dispersive determinations.</description>

      <title>String-Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Adiabatic and Diabatic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement prohibits isolation of color charges, e.g., quarks, in nature via a process called string breaking: the separation of two charges results in an increase in the energy of a color flux, visualized as a string, connecting those charges. Eventually, creating additional charges is energetically favored, hence breaking the string. Such a phenomenon can be probed in simpler models, including quantum spin chains, enabling enhanced understanding of string-breaking dynamics. A challenging task is to understand how string breaking occurs as time elapses, in an out-of-equilibrium setting. This work establishes the phenomenology of dynamical string breaking induced by a gradual increase of string tension over time. It, thus, goes beyond instantaneous quench processes and enables tracking the real-time evolution of strings in a more controlled setting. We focus on domain-wall confinement in a family of quantum Ising chains. Our results indicate that, for sufficiently short strings and slow evolution, string breaking can be described by the transition dynamics of a two-state quantum system akin to a Landau-Zener process. For longer strings, a more intricate spatiotemporal pattern emerges: the string breaks by forming a superposition of bubbles (domains of flipped spins of varying sizes), which involve highly excited states. We finally demonstrate that string breaking driven only by quantum fluctuations can be realized in the presence of sufficiently long-ranged interactions. This work holds immediate relevance for studying string breaking in quantum-simulation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous challenges persist in High Energy Physics (HEP), the addressing of which requires advancements in detection technology, computational methods, data analysis frameworks, and phenomenological designs. We provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent progress across these areas, in line with advances in quantum technology. We will discuss the potential of quantum devices in detecting subtle effects indicative of new physics beyond the Standard Model, the transformative role of quantum algorithms and large-scale quantum computers in studying real-time non-perturbative dynamics in the early universe and at colliders, as well as in analyzing complex HEP data. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of integrating quantum properties into HEP experiments to test quantum mechanics at unprecedented high-energy scales and search for hints of new physics. Looking ahead, the continued integration of resources to fully harness these evolving technologies will enhance our efforts to deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the nature of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To shed light on the properties of states whose nature, internal structure, and spin-parity quantum numbers are not fully elucidated, we systematically study their electromagnetic properties. In light of this concept, we present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic dipole moment of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark within the context of QCD light-cone sum rules, utilizing three distinct interpolating currents in the form of diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations that are likely to couple this pentaquark with $J^P =\frac{3}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. The numerical analysis yielded the following results: $\mu_{{J_\mu^1}}= -0.75 \pm 0.15~\mu_N$, $\mu_{{J_\mu^2}}=2.02 \pm 0.34~\mu_N$ , and $\mu_{{J_\mu^3}}= 1.26 \pm 0.23~\mu_N$. The numerical results obtained have led to the conclusion that the magnetic dipole moments of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ state are capable of projecting its inner structure. As is seen, the different diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state contain important information about its internal structure. Thus, this study will provide prominent data to investigate the inner structure of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state. We compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for interpreting the nature of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ state. We concluded that they do not agree with each other.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Heteropolymers from Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice models are valuable tools to gain insight into the statistical physics of heteropolymers. We rigorously map the partition function of these models into a vacuum expectation value of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT), with both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. Since the associated path integral expression is not affected by a sign problem, it is amenable to Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in both sequence and structure space, unlike conventional polymer field theory. At the same time, since this LGT quantum encoding relies on interacting two-level states (qubits), it sets the stage for capitalizing on the development of quantum computing hardware. As a first illustrative application, we use this formalism to characterize the thermodynamically stable sequences and structures of small heteropolymers consisting of two types of residues.</description>

      <title>Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the $\pi^0$, $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a first ab-initio calculation of the $\pi^0$, $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors performed with physical light-quark masses. We provide a complete parametrization of the form factors that includes both single and double-virtual kinematics. Our results are compared with experimental measurements of the form factors in the space-like region and with the measured two-photon decay widths. In a second step, our parametrizations of the transition form factors are used to compute the dominant pseudoscalar-pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon $g-2$. Our final result reads $a_{\mu}^{\rm hlbl, ps-pole} = (85.1 \pm 5.2) \times 10^{-11}$. Although the pion-pole is dominant, we confirm that, together, the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ provide roughly half of its contribution.</description>

Abstract: Employing the modified Villain lattice formulation of the axion quantum electrodynamics, we present an alternative and much simpler derivation of the conclusion of~Ref.~\cite{Honda:2024sdz} that the sweep of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry operator over the (non-genuine) gauge invariant 't~Hooft line operator with an integer magnetic charge does not leave any effect. The point is that such a 't~Hooft line can be represented by a boundary of a (non-topological) defect that is invariant under the axial transformation on the axion field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable `false' vacuum states are an important feature of the Standard Model of particle physics and many theories beyond it. Describing the dynamics of a phase transition out of a false vacuum via the nucleation of bubbles is essential for understanding the cosmology of vacuum decay and the full spectrum of observables. In this paper, we study vacuum decay by numerically evolving ensembles of field theories in 1+1 dimensions from a metastable state. We demonstrate that for an initial Bose-Einstein distribution of fluctuations, bubbles form with a Gaussian spread of center-of-mass velocities and that bubble nucleation events are preceded by an oscillon -- a long-lived, time-dependent, pseudo-stable configuration of the field. Defining an effective temperature from the long-wavelength amplitude of fluctuations in the ensemble of simulations, we find good agreement between theoretical finite temperature predictions and empirical measurements of the decay rate, velocity distribution and critical bubble solution. We comment on the generalization of our results and the implications for cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Data-driven results for light-quark connected and strange-plus-disconnected hadronic $g-2$ short- and long-distance windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key issue affecting the attempt to reduce the uncertainty on the Standard Model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is the current discrepancy between lattice-QCD and data-driven results for the hadronic vacuum polarization. Progress on this issue benefits from precise data-driven determinations of the isospin-limit light-quark-connected (lqc) and strange-plus-light-quark-disconnected (s+lqd) components of the related RBC/UKQCD windows. In this paper, using a strategy employed previously for the intermediate window, we provide data-driven results for the lqc and s+lqd components of the short- and long-distance RBC/UKQCD windows. Comparing these results with those from the lattice, we find significant discrepancies in the lqc parts but good agreement for the s+lqd components. We also explore the impact of recent CMD-3 $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ cross-section results, demonstrating that an upward shift in the $\rho$-peak region of the type seen in the CMD-3 data serves to eliminate the discrepancies for the lqc components without compromising the good agreement between lattice and data-driven s+lqd results.</description>
