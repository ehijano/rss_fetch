      <title>Spacetime emergence: an (in)effective story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physicists and philosophers are increasingly prone to regarding our current physical theories as providing 'effective descriptions' of real-world systems. In the context of quantum gravity research, this fuels a common view that the classical spacetime theory of general relativity provides effective descriptions where it is successfully applied. That common view of general relativity, in turn, encourages an 'effective' understanding of spacetime emergence. But descriptions of spacetime in general relativity irreducibly include global physical content, which is not effective. Recognizing this fact reigns in the interpretive scope of the common view of general relativity and specifically undermines our thinking about spacetime emergence effectively.</description>

      <title>Book Review: 'Background Independence in Classical and Quantum Gravity', by James Read</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a review of James Read's insightful book, Background Independence in Classical and Quantum Gravity. The book introduces various notions of background-independence which it then makes precise, and uses to make verdicts about background-independence on a wide range of examples of spacetime theories in both classical and quantum gravity. This short book is, in several ways, a worthy example of how technical philosophy of physics ought to be done. I first discuss the content, then raise a number points where I disagree with the book.</description>

      <title>Elegance, Facts, and Scientific Truths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I argue that scientific determinism is not supported by facts, but results from the elegance of the mathematical language physicists use, in particular from the so-called real numbers and their infinite series of digits. Classical physics can thus be interpreted in a deterministic or indeterministic way. However, using quantum physics, some experiments prove that nature is able to continually produce new information, hence support indeterminism in physics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One cannot justifiably presuppose the physical salience of structures derived via decoherence theory based upon an entirely uninterpreted use of the quantum formalism. Non-probabilistic accounts of the emergence of probability via decoherence are thus unconvincing. An alternative account of the emergence of probability involves the combination of \textit{quasi-probabilistic emergence}, via a partially interpreted decoherence model, with \textit{semi-classical emergence}, via averaging of observables with respect to a positive-definite \textit{quasi-probability} function and neglect of terms $O(\hbar)$. This approach avoids well-known issues with constructing classical probability measures in the context of the full set of states of a quantum theory. Rather, it considers a generalised \textit{quasi-measure} structure, \textit{partially interpreted} as weighting of possibilities, over a more general algebra, and delimits the context in which the combination of decoherence and a semi-classical averaging allows us to recover a classical probability model as a coarse-grained description which neglects terms $O(\hbar)$.</description>

      <title>The Newtonian limit of orthonormal frames in metric theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>
