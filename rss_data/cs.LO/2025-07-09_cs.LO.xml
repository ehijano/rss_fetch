      <title>A Formalization of Divided Powers in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an ideal $I$ in a commutative ring $A$, a divided power structure on $I$ is a collection of maps $\{\gamma_n \colon I \to A\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, subject to axioms that imply that it behaves like the family $\{x \mapsto \frac{x^n}{n!}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, but which can be defined even when division by factorials is not possible in $A$. Divided power structures have important applications in diverse areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology, number theory and algebraic geometry.
  In this article we describe a formalization in Lean 4 of the basic theory of divided power structures, including divided power morphisms and sub-divided power ideals, and we provide several fundamental constructions, in particular quotients and sums. This constitutes the first formalization of this theory in any theorem prover.
  As a prerequisite of general interest, we expand the formalized theory of multivariate power series rings, endowing them with a topology and defining evaluation and substitution of power series.</description>

      <title>FuzzFeed: An Automatic Approach to Weakest Precondition Generation using LLMs and Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be practically enhanced through FG.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Supervisor Agent Design for Clinical Reasoning Assistance in a Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA), a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation (MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents (e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed design and implementation is~\href{https://github.com/2sigmaEdTech/MAS/}{open sourced here}.</description>

      <title>An order-theoretic circuit syntax and characterisation of the concept lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take an order-theoretic approach to circuit (string diagram) syntax, treating a circuit as a partial order with additional input-output structure. We define morphisms between circuits and prove a factorisation theorem showing that these can, in the finite case, be regarded as formalising a notion of syntactical circuit rewrites, with quotient maps in particular corresponding to gate composition. We then consider the connectivity of a circuit, expressed as a binary relation between its inputs and outputs, and characterise the concept lattice from formal concept analysis as the unique smallest circuit that admits morphisms from all other circuits with the same connectivity. This has significance for quantum causality, particularly to the study of causal decompositions of unitary transformations. We close by constructing the circuit characterised by the dual statement.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Approach to Diagnosing Faults in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the cause of a system-level failure in a cyber-physical system (CPS) can be like tracing a needle in a haystack. This paper approaches the problem by assuming that the CPS has been designed compositionally and that each component in the system is associated with an assume-guarantee contract. We exploit recent advances in contract-based design that show how to compute the contract for the entire system using the component-level contracts. When presented with a system-level failure, our approach is able to efficiently identify the components that are responsible for the system-level failure together with the specific predicates in those components' specifications that are involved in the fault. We implemented this approach using Pacti and demonstrate it through illustrative examples inspired by an autonomous vehicle in the DARPA urban challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05519v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how (deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation (negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming (ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being elegantly resolved.</description>

      <title>Automated Reasoning for Vulnerability Management by Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges. The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus systematically manage vulnerability postures.</description>

      <title>Automata Linear Dynamic Logic on Finite Traces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12003v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal logics are widely used by the Formal Methods and AI communities. Linear Temporal Logic is a popular temporal logic and is valued for its ease of use as well as its balance between expressiveness and complexity. LTL is equivalent in expressiveness to Monadic First-Order Logic and satisfiability for LTL is PSPACE-complete. Linear Dynamic Logic (LDL), another temporal logic, is equivalent to Monadic Second-Order Logic, but its method of satisfiability checking cannot be applied to a nontrivial subset of LDL formulas.

Here we introduce Automata Linear Dynamic Logic on Finite Traces (ALDL_f) and show that satisfiability for ALDL_f formulas is in PSPACE. A variant of Linear Dynamic Logic on Finite Traces (LDL_f), ALDL_f combines propositional logic with nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to express temporal constraints. ALDL$_f$ is equivalent in expressiveness to Monadic Second-Order Logic. This is a gain in expressiveness over LTL at no cost.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Strategies: Definability and the Tensor Completeness Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programs that combine I/O and countable probabilistic choice, modulo either bisimilarity or trace equivalence, can be seen as describing a probabilistic strategy. For well-founded programs, we might expect to axiomatize bisimilarity via a sum of equational theories and trace equivalence via a tensor of such theories. This is by analogy with similar results for nondeterminism, established previously.
  While bisimilarity is indeed axiomatized via a sum of theories, and the tensor is indeed at least sound for trace equivalence, completeness in general, remains an open problem. Nevertheless, we show completeness in the case that either the probabilistic choice or the I/O operations used are finitary. We also show completeness up to impersonation, i.e. that the tensor theory regards trace equivalent programs as solving the same system of equations. This entails completeness up to the cancellation law of the probabilistic choice operator.
  Furthermore, we show that a probabilistic trace strategy arises as the semantics of a well-founded program iff it is victorious. This means that, when the strategy is played against any partial counterstrategy, the probability of play continuing forever is zero.</description>

      <title>Ohana trees and Taylor expansion for the $\lambda$I-calculus. No variable gets left behind or forgotten!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the $\lambda$I-calculus is a natural fragment of the $\lambda$-calculus, obtained by forbidding the erasure, its equational theories did not receive much attention. The reason is that all proper denotational models studied in the literature equate all non-normalizable $\lambda$I-terms, whence the associated theory is not very informative. The goal of this paper is to introduce a previously unknown theory of the $\lambda$I-calculus, induced by a notion of evaluation trees that we call "Ohana trees". The Ohana tree of a $\lambda$I-term is an annotated version of its B\"ohm tree, remembering all free variables that are hidden within its meaningless subtrees, or pushed into infinity along its infinite branches.
  We develop the associated theories of program approximation: the first approach -- more classic -- is based on finite trees and continuity, the second adapts Ehrhard and Regnier's Taylor expansion. We then prove a Commutation Theorem stating that the normal form of the Taylor expansion of a $\lambda$I-term coincides with the Taylor expansion of its Ohana tree. As a corollary, we obtain that the equality induced by Ohana trees is compatible with abstraction and application. We conclude by discussing the cases of L\'evy-Longo and Berarducci trees, and generalizations to the full $\lambda$-calculus.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Model-Checking Quantum Pushdown Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18439v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of model-checking quantum pushdown systems from a computational complexity point of view. We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:
  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-hard. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>

      <title>Difference of Constrained Patterns in Logically Constrained Term Rewrite Systems (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering patterns as sets of their instances, a difference operator over patterns computes a finite set of two given patterns, which represents the difference between the dividend pattern and the divisor pattern. A complement of a pattern is a pattern set, the ground constructor instances of which comprise the complement of the ground constructor instances of the former pattern. Given finitely many unconstrained linear patterns, using a difference operator over linear patterns, a complement algorithm returns a finite set of linear patterns as a complement of the given patterns. In this paper, we extend the difference operator and complement algorithm to constrained linear patterns used in logically constrained term rewrite systems (LCTRSs, for short) that have no user-defined constructor term with a sort for built-in values. Then, as for left-linear term rewrite systems, using the complement algorithm, we show that quasi-reducibility is decidable for such LCTRSs with decidable built-in theories. For the single use of the difference operator over constrained patterns, only divisor patterns are required to be linear.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with $\omega$-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an $\omega$-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of B\"uchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>
