      <title>Meson width predictions and symmetry emergence within the deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a deep neural network model to predict meson widths from quantum numbers and masses based on the Transformer architecture. A Gaussian Monte-Carlo data enhancement method is adopted to enhance the meson data by considering the experimental errors, which significantly increase the data samples and improve the robustness and generalization performance of the model. With the meson widths ranging from $\sim10^{-14}$ to 625 MeV, the relative errors of the predictions behave $0.07\%$, $1.0\%$, and $0.14\%$ in the training set, the test set, and all the data, respectively. The width predictions are presented for the currently discovered mesons and some theoretically predicted states. We also use the model as a probe to study the quantum numbers and inner structures for some undetermined states. Furthermore, this data-driven model is investigated to show well charge conjugation symmetry and approximate isospin symmetry, which is consistent with the physical phenomena. The results indicate that the deep neural network has powerful learning and inference abilities to describe and explore the hadron structures and the complicated interactions in particle physics.</description>

      <title>The odd-parity strange baryons $\Sigma\,(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ below 1.8 GeV with Hamiltonian effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the spectrum of the $\Sigma\,(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ family based on the experimental $K^-p$ scattering data and lattice QCD simulations within the Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory. Especially, two different scenarios are constructed in order to clarify whether there is one or two $\Sigma\,(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ resonances with masses around 1.5$\sim$1.7 GeV. The relevant lattice QCD data support our scenario with two resonance poles at $1687-110\,i$ and $1714-14\,i$ MeV in which the bare strange triquark core plays an important role. We also show an extra clear cusp structure around 1.4 GeV in our scattering T matrices associated with the odd-parity strange baryons.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation Framework for Gauge Theories on the Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate gauge theories in two dimensions nonperturbatively using the Hamiltonian truncation approach. Working on a spatial interval and adopting the axial gauge, we remove all gauge field degrees of freedom and express the interacting Hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of the free Dirac theory, truncated at a finite energy. As a benchmark we analyse the Schwinger model, where our numerical spectra agree closely with the exact results from bosonization across a wide range of couplings, validating the construction of the Hamiltonian. We then generalize the formulation to nonabelian gauge groups and apply it to SU(3) gauge theory with a single massless Dirac fermion. These results demonstrate that gauge theories can be explored nonperturbatively using a truncated Hamiltonian that generates evolutions in ordinary time, offering a complementary alternative to lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal local basis truncation of lattice quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to optimally reduce the local Hilbert basis of lattice quantum many-body (QMB) Hamiltonians. The basis truncation exploits the most relevant eigenvalues of the estimated single-site reduced density matrix (RDM). It is accurate and numerically stable across different model phases, even close to quantum phase transitions. We apply this procedure to different models, such as the Sine-Gordon model, the $\varphi^{4}$ theory, and lattice gauge theories, namely Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, in one and two spatial dimensions. Our results reduce state-of-the-art estimates of computational resources for classical and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Gauge Covariant Link Formulation of Twisted N=D=4 and N=4 D=5 Super Yang-Mills on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of four dimensional super Yang-Mills model with a twisted N=4 supersymmetry in a manifestly gauge covariant manner. The formulation we employ here is a four dimensional extension of the manifestly gauge covariant method which was developed in our proposals of Dirac-Kahler twisted N=D=2 and N=4 D=3 super Yang-Mills on a lattice. Twisted N=4 supersymmetry algebra is geometrically realized on a four dimensional lattice with link supercharges and the use of link (anti-)commutators. Employing Grassmann parameters with link nature, we explicitly show that the resulting super Yang-Mills action is invariant under all the supercharges on a lattice without chiral fermion problems. As a group and algebraic interpretation of the link approach, we show that promoting bosonic supercovariant derivatives to their exponentials consistently with the lattice Leibniz rule naturally gives rise to the notion of gauge covariant link (anti-)commutators. This can be regarded as a fermionic decomposition of a Lie group element, which may provide a new methodology in super Lie group and super Lie algebra. We also provide a five dimensional lift-up of the formulation with exact N=4 SUSY invariance on a five dimensional lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.</description>

      <title>TASI/CERN/KITP Lecture Notes on "Toward Quantum Computing Gauge Theories of Nature"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics.
  These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.</description>

      <title>Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) for Adiabatic State Preparation and Time Evolution in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.</description>

      <title>Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative quantum field theory, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</description>
