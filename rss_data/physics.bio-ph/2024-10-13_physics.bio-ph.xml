      <title>Cooperative and Inhibitory Ion Transport in Functionalized Angstrom-Scale Two-Dimensional Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant success has been achieved in fabricating angstrom-scale artificial solid ionic channels aiming to replicate the biological ion channels (BICs).Besides high selectivity, BICs also exhibit sophisticated ion gating and interplay. However, such behavior and functionality are seldomly recreated in the artificial counterparts due to the insufficient understanding of the molecular origin. Here we report cooperative and inhibitory ion transport in angstrom-scale acetate functionalized MoS2 two dimensional channels.</description>

      <title>Foundation and challenges in modelling Dilute Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active suspensions, which consist of suspended self-propelling particles such as swimming microorganisms, often exhibit non-trivial transport properties. Continuum models are frequently employed to elucidate phenomena in active suspensions, such as shear trapping of bacteria, bacterial turbulence, and bioconvection patterns in suspensions of algae. Yet, these models are often empirically derived and may not always agree with the individual-based description of active particles. Here we establish a more rigorous foundation to fully develop a continuum model based on the respective microscopic dynamics through coarse-graining. All the assumptions needed to reach popular continuum models from a multi-particle Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the probability of the full configuration space, are explicitly presented. In the dilute limit, this approach leads to the mean-field model (a.k.a. Doi-Saintillan-Shelley model), which can be further reduced to a continuum equation for particle density. Moreover, we review the limitations and highlight the challenges related to continuum descriptions, including significant issues in implementing physical boundary conditions and the possible emergence of singular solutions.</description>

      <title>Detecting collagen by machine learning improved photoacoustic spectral analysis for breast cancer diagnostics: feasibility studies with murine models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collagen, a key structural component of the extracellular matrix, undergoes significant remodeling during carcinogenesis. However, the important role of collagen levels in breast cancer diagnostics still lacks effective in vivo detection techniques to provide a deeper understanding. This study presents photoacoustic spectral analysis improved by machine learning as a promising non-invasive diagnostic method, focusing on exploring collagen as a salient biomarker. Murine model experiments revealed more profound associations of collagen with other cancer components than in normal tissues. Moreover, an optimal set of feature wavelengths was identified by a genetic algorithm for enhanced diagnostic performance, among which 75% were from collagen-dominated absorption wavebands. Using optimal spectra, the diagnostic algorithm achieved 72% accuracy, 66% sensitivity, and 78% specificity, surpassing full-range spectra by 6%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. The proposed photoacoustic methods examine the feasibility of offering valuable biochemical insights into existing techniques, showing great potential for early-stage cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Theory for sequence selection via phase separation and oligomerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium selection pressures were proposed for the formation of oligonucleotides with rich functionalities encoded in their sequences, such as catalysis. Since phase separation was shown to direct various chemical processes, we ask whether condensed phases can provide mechanisms for sequence selection. To answer this question, we use non-equilibrium thermodynamics and describe the reversible oligomerization of different monomers to sequences at non-dilute conditions prone to phase separation. We find that when sequences oligomerize, their interactions give rise to phase separation, boosting specific sequences' enrichment and depletion. Our key result is that phase separation gives rise to a selection pressure for the oligomerization of specific sequence patterns when fragmentation maintains the system away from equilibrium. Specifically, slow fragmentation favors alternating sequences that interact well with their environment (more cooperative), while fast fragmentation selects sequences with extended motifs capable of specific sequence interactions (less cooperative). Our results highlight that out-of-equilibrium condensed phases could provide versatile hubs for Darwinian-like evolution toward functional sequences, both relevant for the molecular origin of life and de novo life.</description>

      <title>Cyclic jetting enables microbubble-mediated drug delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of targeted therapies capable of overcoming biological barriers, including the tenacious blood-brain barrier, has spurred the investigation into stimuli-responsive microagents. This approach could improve therapeutic efficacy, reduce undesirable side effects, and open avenues for treating previously incurable diseases. Intravenously-administered ultrasound-responsive microbubbles are one of the most promising agents, having demonstrated potential in several clinical trials. However, the mechanism by which microbubbles enhance drug absorption remains unclear. Here, we reveal through unprecedented time-resolved side-view visualisations that single microbubbles, upon microsecond-long ultrasound driving, puncture the cell membrane and induce drug uptake via stable cyclic microjets. Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, warranting recognition as a novel class of jets in bubbles, distinct from classical inertial jets driven by pressure gradients. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation. Remarkably, these microjets occur at ultrasound pressures below 100 kPa due to their unique formation mechanism. We show that the stress generated by microjetting surpasses all previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude. In summary, this work elucidates the physics behind microbubble-mediated targeted drug delivery and provides criteria for its effective yet safe application.</description>

      <title>Macrotransport of active particles in periodic channels and fields: rectification and dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport and dispersion of active particles in structured environments such as corrugated channels and porous media are important for the understanding of both natural and engineered active systems. Owing to their continuous self-propulsion, active particles exhibit rectified transport under spatially asymmetric confinement. While progress has been made in experiments and particle-based simulations, a theoretical understanding of the effective long-time transport dynamics in spatially periodic geometries remains less developed. In this paper, we apply generalized Taylor dispersion theory (GTDT) to analyze the long-time effective transport dynamics of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in periodic channels and fields. We show that the long-time transport behavior is governed by an effective advection-diffusion equation. The derived macrotransport equations allow us to characterize the average drift and effective dispersion coefficient. For the case of ABPs subject to a no-flux boundary condition at the channel wall, we show that regardless of activity, the average drift is given by the net diffusive flux along the channel. For ABPs, their activity is the driving mechanism that sustains a density gradient, which ultimately leads to rectified motion along the channel. Our continuum theory is validated against direct Brownian dynamics simulations of the Langevin equations governing the motion of each ABP.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity is necessary for robust dimensional reduction and strong responses in stochastic topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological theory predicts the necessary conditions for robust dimensional reduction in a host of quantum and classical systems. Models have recently been proposed for stochastic systems which describe many biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for this class of systems, exemplified by the breakdown of the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We prove that contrary to topological phases in quantum and many classical systems, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions for robust edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. We propose a novel explanation of hybridization that destroys edge responses in reciprocal (Hermitian) stochastic systems. Further, we show that stochastic steady states grow dramatically with non-reciprocity, in contrast to their quantum counterparts which plateaus. We analyze the resulting theoretical and physical consequences and how non-reciprocity mitigates the effects of hybridization towards robust edge states in equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states. These results establish the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions for responses that are robust to random perturbations in active and living matter.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and stochastic simulations of chemically active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a central role in the spatial organization of living matter. Their formation is now well understood as a form of liquid-liquid phase separation that occurs very far from equilibrium. For instance, they can be modeled as active droplets, where the combination of molecular interactions and chemical reactions result in microphase separation. However, so far, models of chemically active droplets are spatially continuous and deterministic. Therefore, the relationship between the microscopic parameters of the models and some crucial properties of active droplets (such as their polydispersity, their shape anisotropy, or their typical lifetime) is yet to be established. In this work, we address this question computationally, using Brownian dynamics simulations of chemically active droplets: the building blocks are represented explicitly as particles that interact with attractive or repulsive interactions, depending on whether they are in a droplet-forming state or not. Thanks to this microscopic and stochastic view of the problem, we reveal how driving the system away from equilibrium in a controlled way determines the fluctuations and dynamics of active emulsions.</description>
