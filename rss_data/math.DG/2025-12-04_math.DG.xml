      <title>A Conformal Positive Mass Theorem with Noncompact Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an integral inequality for asymptotically linear harmonic functions on asymptotically flat 3-manifolds with noncompact boundary, which implies positivity of a convex combination of ADM masses of two conformally related metrics under a positivity condition on a corresponding convex combination of their scalar curvatures and boundary mean curvatures. This generalizes a result of Batista and Lopes de Lima, under conditions that do not assume positivity of scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>K-polystability of Asymptotically Conical K\"ahler-Ricci Shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Sun-Zhang have developed an algebraic theory for K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers showing that they admit the structure of a polarized Fano fibration $(\pi: X \to Y, \xi)$. In particular, they conjecture that existence of a K\"ahler-Ricci shrinker metric is equivalent to a notion of K-stability. We prove one direction of this conjecture, namely that existence of a K\"ahler-Ricci shrinker metric $g$ implies K-polystability of $(\pi: X \to Y, \xi)$, in the case that the Ricci curvature of $g$ decays at infinity.</description>

      <title>Anti-self-dual blowups II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a closed, oriented four-manifold with $b_2^+ \leq 3$, and suppose $X$ contains a collection of pairwise disjoint embedded $(-2)$-spheres. We prove that there is a Riemannian metric on $X$ such that the Poincare dual of each of these spheres is represented by an anti-self-dual harmonic form. This extends our earlier result for $(-1)$-spheres. The main new ingredient is an application of Eliashberg's $h$-principle for overtwisted contact structures, which we use to construct self-dual harmonic forms on four-orbifolds with prescribed local behaviour near the orbifold singular set.</description>

      <title>From n-systems to Lie and Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for constructing pure algebroids, dull algebroids, and Lie algebroids. The construction relies on what we deffned as n-systems on vector bundles, and we provide explicit computations for all resulting structure maps. Analogously, metric n-systems deffned on metric vector bundles allow us to construct metric algebroids, pre-Courant algebroids, and Courant algebroids.</description>

      <title>On stationary real matrix Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study when a real matrix Schubert variety is stationary with respect to the first variation. We first show that a necessary condition for its open dense regular part to be a minimal submanifold is that the corresponding partial permutation is vexillary. Among vexillary partial permutations, we establish minimality by a geometric argument when the Rothe diagram is of Grassmannian type and has at most two connected components. We further obtain, as a corollary, the minimality of those varieties that decompose as products of this type. These varieties include all determinantal varieties as well as some new minimal cones.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Einstein toric submanifolds of the projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on the four families of examples of symmetric toric Fano manifolds presented by Batyrev and Selivanova cannot be realized as metrics induced by immersions into projective spaces equipped with Fubini-Study metrics. We obtain a similar conclusion for the non-symmetric examples discovered by Nill and Paffenholz. A consequence is that a centrally symmetric toric Fano manifold admits a K\"ahler-Einstein metric induced by a projective immersion if and only if it is a product of projective lines. These results provide evidence for a broader conjecture characterizing which K\"ahler-Einstein metrics can be induced by projective immersions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate critical metrics of the volume functional on complete manifolds without boundary. We prove that any critical metric of the volume functional on a connected, complete manifold with parallel Ricci tensor is isometric to one of the standard models. Moreover, we show that a Bach-flat critical metric of the volume functional on a complete, simply connected manifold with proper potential function is isometric to one of the following: the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$, Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, or a warped product $\mathbb{R} \times_{\varphi} \Sigma_c$, where $\Sigma_c$ is a regular level set of the potential function. In particular, we establish classification results in dimensions three and four under weaker assumptions on the Bach tensor.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal deformations of Lie algebroid pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinitesimal deformations of Lie algebroid pairs in the category of smooth manifolds enriched with a local Artinian algebra. Given a Lie algebroid pair $(L,A)$, i.e. a Lie algebroid $L$ together with a Lie subalgebroid $A$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations of $(L,A)$ modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations of $L$ and those from the exponentials of inner derivations of $L$, respectively. For the associated two deformation functors, we find the associated governing $L_\infty$-algebras in the sense of extended deformation theory. Furthermore, when $(L,A)$ is a matched Lie pair, i.e. the quotient $L/A$ is also a Lie subalgebroid of $L$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations along the normal direction $L/A$. The extended deformation theory of the associated deformation functor recovers the formal deformation theory of complex structures and that of transversely holomorphic foliations.</description>

      <title>Bounded-degree graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature have subexponential growth and diffusive random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric properties of graphs with non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature, a discrete analogue of non-negative Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry. We prove that for each $d&lt;\infty$ there exists a constant $C_d$ such that if $G=(V,E)$ is a finite graph with non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature and with degrees bounded by $d$ then the average log-volume growth and random walk displacement satisfy \[
  \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{x\in V} \log \#B(x,r) \leq \exp\left[C_d \sqrt{\log r}\right] = r^{o(1)} \] and \[
  \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{x\in V} \mathbf{E}_x [d(X_0,X_n)^2] \leq n \exp\left[C_d \sqrt{\log n}\right] = n^{1+o(1)} \] for every $n,r\geq 2$. This significantly strengthens a result of Salez (GAFA 2022), who proved that the average displacement of the random walk is $o(n)$ and deduced that non-negatively curved graphs of bounded degree cannot be expanders. Our results also apply to infinite transitive graphs and, more generally, to bounded-degree unimodular random rooted graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Canonical metrics on families of vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric partial differential equation for families of holomorphic vector bundles, generalising the theory of Hermite--Einstein metrics. We consider families of holomorphic vector bundles which each admit Hermite--Einstein metrics, together with a first order deformation. On such families, we define the family Hermite--Einstein equation for Hermitian metrics, which we view as a notion of a canonical metric in this setting.
  We prove two main results concerning family Hermite--Einstein metrics. Firstly, we construct Hermite--Einstein metrics in adiabatic classes on product manifolds, assuming the existence of a family Hermite--Einstein metric. Secondly, we prove that the associated parabolic flow admits a unique smooth solution for all time, and use this to show that the Dirichlet problem always admits a unique solution.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of infinite-dimensional reduced Heisenberg groups which can be viewed as infinite-dimensional homogeneous spaces. Such a space is an analogue of finite-dimensional reduced Heisenberg groups in infinite dimensions. We study properties of the hypoelliptic heat kernel measure on this space, including hypoelliptic logarithmic Sobolev inequalities there.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a pair of solutions to the open WDVV equations associated with the infinite-dimensional Frobenius manifolds that underlie the genus-zero universal Whitham hierarchy, and for the resulting flat F-manifolds, we explicitly construct their principal hierarchies. We further demonstrate that this construction is compatible with finite-dimensional reductions, yielding solutions for Frobenius manifolds associated with general rational superpotentials and those subject to a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry reduction. In particular, the polynomial solutions derived by Basalaev and Buryak via open Saito theory for A- and D-type singularities are recovered as special cases.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, and show that the forward Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or scattering matrix) is a fractional power of the boundary wave operator modulo lower order terms in the sense of paired Lagrangian distributions. We use it to show that, outside of a countable set of mass parameters, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map determines the Taylor series of the bulk metric at the boundary, and hence allows the recovery of a real analytic metric or Einstein metric modulo isometries. Furthermore, we prove a Lorentzian version of the Graham-Zworski theorem relating poles of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to conformally invariant powers of the boundary wave operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an index formula for the Dirac operator acting on two-valued spinors on a $3$-manifold $M$ which branch along a smoothly embedded graph $\Sigma \subset M$, and with respect to a boundary condition along $\Sigma$ inspired by an instance of this setting related to the deformation theory of $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinors. When $\Sigma$ is a smooth embedded curve, this index vanishes; this was proved earlier by one of us, but the proof here is different and extends to the more general setting where $\Sigma$ also has vertices. We focus primarily on the Dirac operator itself, but also show how our results apply to more general twisted Dirac operators and to the closely related $\mathbb Z_2$ harmonic $1$-forms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We count and give a parametrization of connected components in the space of flags transverse to a given transverse pair in every flag varieties of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and, using methods of Dey--Greenberg--Riestenberg, we show that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit computation of some Pl\"ucker coordinates to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>

      <title>Differential Geometry of the Fixed-Rank Core Covariance Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the differential geometry of the fixed-rank core covariance manifold. According to Hoff, McCormack, and Zhang [J. R. Stat. Soc., B: Stat., 85 (2023), pp. 1659--1679], every covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of $p_1\times p_2$ matrix-variate data uniquely decomposes into a separable component $K$ and a core component $C$. Such a decomposition also exists for rank-$r$ $\Sigma$ if $p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1&lt;r$, with $C$ sharing the same rank. They posed an open question on whether a partial-isotropy structure can be imposed on $C$ for high-dimensional covariance estimation. We address this question by showing that a partial-isotropy rank-$r$ core is a non-trivial convex combination of a rank-$r$ core and $I_p$ for $p:=p_1p_2$, motivating the study of rank-$r$ cores. For fixed $r&gt;p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1$, we prove that the set of rank-$r$ cores, $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, is a compact, smooth, embedded submanifold of the set of rank-$r$ positive semi-definite matrices, except for a measure-zero subset associated with canonical decomposability. When $r=p$, the set of full-rank cores $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ is itself a smooth manifold. Moreover, the positive definite cone $\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ is diffeomorphic to the product of the Kronecker and core covariance manifolds, providing new geometric insight into $\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ via separability. Differential geometric quantities, such as the differential of the diffeomorphism, as well as the Riemannian gradient and Hessian operator on $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ and the manifolds used in constructing $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, are also derived. Lastly, we propose a partial-isotropy core shrinkage estimator for matrix-variate data, supported by numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Maximal symplectic torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are several different notions of maximal torus actions on smooth manifolds, in various contexts: symplectic, Riemannian, complex. In the symplectic context, for the so-called isotropy-maximal actions, as well as for the weaker notion of almost isotropy-maximal actions, we give classifications up to equivariant symplectomorphism. These classification results give symplectic analogues of recent classifications in the complex and Riemannian contexts. Moreover, we deduce that every almost isotropy-maximal symplectic torus action is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a product of a symplectic toric manifold and a torus, answering a question of Ishida. The classification theorems are consequences of Duistermaat and Pelayo's classification of symplectic torus actions with coisotropic orbits.</description>

      <title>Note on Regularity theory for Nonlinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present several seminal developments in the regularity theory of nonlinear (uniformly) elliptic equations, including the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory concerning the Hilbert 19th problem and variational equations, as well as the Krylov-Safonov and Evans-Safonov theories for fully nonlinear equations.</description>
