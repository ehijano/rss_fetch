      <title>Integrating En Route and Home Proximity in EV Charging Accessibility: A Spatial Analysis in the Washington Metropolitan Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the accessibility of public EV charging stations in the Washington metropolitan area using a comprehensive measure that accounts for both destination-based and en route charging opportunities. By incorporating the full spectrum of daily travel patterns into the accessibility evaluation, our methodology offers a more realistic measure of charging opportunities than destination-based methods that prioritize proximity to residential locations. Results from spatial autocorrelation analysis indicate that conventional accessibility assessments often overestimate the availability of infrastructure in central urban areas and underestimate it in peripheral commuting zones, potentially leading to misallocated resources. By highlighting significant clusters of high-access and low-access areas, our approach identifies spatial inequalities in infrastructure distribution and provides insights into areas requiring targeted interventions. This study underscores the importance of incorporating daily mobility patterns into urban planning to ensure equitable access to EV charging infrastructure and suggests a framework that other regions could adopt to enhance sustainable transportation networks and support equitable urban development.</description>

      <title>Typical daily profiles of PM concentrations in parisian underground railway stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the understanding of air quality within underground railway stations (URS), a methodology has been developed to establish a baseline profile of particle concentrations (PM10 and PM2.5). This approach incorporates an extensive data cleaning process based on the identification of URS operation periods, physically inconsistent or mathematically aberrant data, and comparing the profile of each day to an average profile. The versatility of this methodology allows its application to different particle classes within various URS. The results obtained from the three studied URS indicate the possibility of obtaining reliable daily typical profiles even over short measurement periods (up to one or two weeks).</description>

      <title>Scientific and technological knowledge grows linearly over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past few centuries have witnessed a dramatic growth in scientific and technological knowledge. However, the nature of that growth - whether exponential or otherwise - remains controversial, perhaps partly due to the lack of quantitative characterizations. We evaluated knowledge as a collective thinking structure, using citation networks as a representation, by examining extensive datasets that include 213 million publications (1800-2020) and 7.6 million patents (1976-2020). We found that knowledge - which we conceptualize as the reduction of uncertainty in a knowledge network - grew linearly over time in naturally formed citation networks that themselves expanded exponentially. Moreover, our results revealed inflection points in the growth of knowledge that often corresponded to important developments within fields, such as major breakthroughs, new paradigms, or the emergence of entirely new areas of study. Around these inflection points, knowledge may grow rapidly or exponentially on a local scale, although the overall growth rate remains linear when viewed globally. Previous studies concluding an exponential growth of knowledge may have focused primarily on these local bursts of rapid growth around key developments, leading to the misconception of a global exponential trend. Our findings help to reconcile the discrepancy between the perceived exponential growth and the actual linear growth of knowledge by highlighting the distinction between local and global growth patterns. Overall, our findings reveal major science development trends for policymaking, showing that producing knowledge is far more challenging than producing papers.</description>

      <title>A Review on Flood Risk Conceptual Frameworks and Development of Hierarchical Structures for Assessment Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change and rapid urbanization have led to more frequent and severe flooding, causing significant damage. The existing literature on flood risk encompasses a variety of dimensions, such as physical, economic, social, political, environmental, infrastructural, and managerial aspects. This paper aims to provide an extensive review of proposed conceptual frameworks and their components used in flood risk assessment. For this purpose, Initially, conceptual frameworks were extracted to configure the components of flood risk including hazard, vulnerability, exposure, resilience, and susceptibility. Subsequently, a comprehensive set of criteria from the literature were identified, addressing risk components. In this paper, the risk conceptual framework is defined by the intersection of vulnerability and hazard. Vulnerability, shaped by exposure and susceptibility, can be reduced by enhancing resiliency, which includes coping and adaptive capacities. In total, 102 criteria/subcriteria were identified and classified into three hierarchical structures of hazard, susceptibility, and resilience. Finally, flood risk assessment methods were reviewed, with an emphasis on their applicability and characteristics. The review highlighted the strengths and limitations of various methods, providing a comprehensive overview of their suitability for different scenarios. The outcomes of this review could serve as a valuable reference for professionals involved in flood risk assessment, aiding in the identification of the most appropriate risk concepts, assessment criteria, and suitable methods for quantification based on the specific study area and data availability.</description>

      <title>Stark Decline in Journalists' Use of Preprints Post-pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of preprints, aiding rapid research dissemination but also facilitating the spread of misinformation. This study analyzes media coverage of preprints from 2014 to 2023, revealing a significant post-pandemic decline. Our findings suggest that heightened awareness of the risks associated with preprints has led to more cautious media practices. While the decline in preprint coverage may mitigate concerns about premature media exposure, it also raises questions about the future role of preprints in science communication, especially during emergencies. Balanced policies based on up-to-date evidence are needed to address this shift.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in the Kuramoto model with external forcing and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is an important phenomenon in a wide variety of systems comprising interacting oscillatory units, whether natural (like neurons, biochemical reactions, cardiac cells) or artificial (like metronomes, power grids, Josephson junctions). The Kuramoto model provides a simple description of these systems and has been useful in their mathematical exploration. Here we investigate this model in the presence of two characteristics that may be important in applications: an external periodic influence and higher-order interactions among the units. The combination of these ingredients leads to a very rich bifurcation scenario in the dynamics of the order parameter that describes phase transitions. Our theoretical calculations are validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Decentralized Social Media: LLM Agents for Automating Community Rule Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring content compliance with community guidelines is crucial for maintaining healthy online social environments. However, traditional human-based compliance checking struggles with scaling due to the increasing volume of user-generated content and a limited number of moderators. Recent advancements in Natural Language Understanding demonstrated by Large Language Models unlock new opportunities for automated content compliance verification. This work evaluates six AI-agents built on Open-LLMs for automated rule compliance checking in Decentralized Social Networks, a challenging environment due to heterogeneous community scopes and rules. Analyzing over 50,000 posts from hundreds of Mastodon servers, we find that AI-agents effectively detect non-compliant content, grasp linguistic subtleties, and adapt to diverse community contexts. Most agents also show high inter-rater reliability and consistency in score justification and suggestions for compliance. Human-based evaluation with domain experts confirmed the agents' reliability and usefulness, rendering them promising tools for semi-automated or human-in-the-loop content moderation systems.</description>

      <title>E2MoCase: A Dataset for Emotional, Event and Moral Observations in News Articles on High-impact Legal Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way media reports on legal cases can significantly shape public opinion, often embedding subtle biases that influence societal views on justice and morality. Analyzing these biases requires a holistic approach that captures the emotional tone, moral framing, and specific events within the narratives. In this work we introduce E2MoCase, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the integrated analysis of emotions, moral values, and events within legal narratives and media coverage. By leveraging advanced models for emotion detection, moral value identification, and event extraction, E2MoCase offers a multi-dimensional perspective on how legal cases are portrayed in news articles.</description>

      <title>Social network heterogeneity benefits individuals at the expense of groups in the creation of innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Innovation is fundamental for development and provides a competitive advantage for societies. It is the process of creating more complex technologies, ideas, or protocols from existing ones. While innovation may be created by single agents (i.e. individuals or organisations), it is often a result of social interactions between agents exchanging and combining complementary expertise and perspectives. The structure of social networks impacts this knowledge exchange process. To study the role of social network structures on the creation of new technologies, we design an evolutionary mechanistic model combining self-creation and social learning. We find that social heterogeneity allows agents to leverage the benefits of diversity and to develop technologies of higher complexity. Social heterogeneity, however, reduces the group ability to innovate. Not only the social structure but also the openness of agents to collaborate affect innovation. We find that interdisciplinary interactions lead to more complex technologies benefiting the entire group but also increase the inequality in the innovation output. Lower openness to interdisciplinary collaborations may be compensated by a higher ability to collaborate with multiple peers, but low openness also neutralises the intrinsic benefits of network heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that social network heterogeneity has contrasting effects on microscopic (local) and macroscopic (group) levels, suggesting that the emergence of innovation leaders may suppress the overall group performance.</description>

      <title>Universal behavior of the Covid-19 tails: Inverse power-law distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power-law distribution is one of the most important laws known in nature. Such a special universal behavior is known to occur in very few physical systems. In this Letter, we analyzed the mortality distribution of the Covid-19 pandemic tails for different countries and continents to discuss the possible universal behavior of the pandemic. Surprisingly, we found that the mortality distribution of Covid-19 final i.e., the latest tails in 2023 follows inverse power-law decays. These universal behaviors for the pandemic are reported in the present work for the first time. Additionally, we showed that these mortality tails also decay with time obeying to the inverse power-law.</description>

      <title>Identifying vegetation patterns for a qualitative assessment of land degradation using a cellular automata model and satellite imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to identify the spatial distribution of vegetation and its growth dynamics with the purpose of obtaining a qualitative assessment of vegetation characteristics tied to its condition, productivity and health, and to land degradation. To do so, we compare a statistical model of vegetation growth and land surface imagery derived vegetation indices. Specifically, we analyze a stochastic cellular automata model and data obtained from satellite images, namely using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). In the experimental data, we look for areas where vegetation is broken into small patches and qualitatively compare it to the percolating, fragmented, and degraded states that appear in the cellular automata model. We model the periodic effect of seasons, finding numerical evidence of a periodic fragmentation and recovery phenomenology if the model parameters are sufficiently close to the model's percolation transition. We qualitatively recognize these effects in real-world vegetation images and consider them a signal of increased environmental stress and vulnerability. Finally, we show an estimation of the environmental stress in land images by considering both the vegetation density and its clusterization.</description>
