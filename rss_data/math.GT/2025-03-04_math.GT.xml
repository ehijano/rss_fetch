      <title>On uniqueness of the equivariant smooth structure on a real moment-angle manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the well-known problem of smooth structures on moment-angle manifolds. Each real or complex moment-angle manifold has an equivariant smooth structure given by an intersection of quadrics corresponding to a geometric realisation of a polytope. In 2006 F.Bosio and L.Meersseman proved that complex moment-angle manifolds of combinatorially equivalent simple polytopes are equivariantly diffeomorphic. Using arguments from calculus we derive from this result that real moment-angle manifolds of combinatorially equivalent simple polytopes are equivariantly diffeomorphic and the polytopes are diffeomorphic as manifolds with corners.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stated Skein Theory and Double Affine Hecke Algebra Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we explore the representation theory of double affine Hecke algebras (DAHAs) through the lens of stated skein theory. Over the past decade, there have been several works establishing robust connections between skein algebras and DAHAs. Particularly, Samuelson proved that a spherical subalgebra of the type $A_1$ DAHA can be realized as a quotient of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the torus with boundary, $K_q(T^2 \setminus D^2)$. Since the $A_1$ double affine Hecke algebra is Morita equivalent to its spherical subalgebra, discovering modules for $K_q(T^2 \setminus D^2)$ immediately provides us with modules for the $A_1$ DAHA.
  Stated skein theory enhances traditional Kauffman bracket skein theory by incorporating the boundary components of manifolds, thereby offering additional properties such as excision that enrich the algebraic structure. Furthermore, Kauffman bracket skein algebras embed into their stated counterparts, showing that stated skein algebras are extensions of Kauffman bracket skein algebras. We use this extended framework to further develop the representation theory of the $A_1$ DAHA.
  After identifying generators for the stated skein algebra of $T^2 \setminus D^2$, we embed this algebra into a quantum $6$-torus and leverage the nice representation-theoretic properties of quantum tori to construct a module of Laurent polynomials. Additionally, as $T^2$ is the boundary of any knot complement, we discuss how to construct a more topologically-defined module from various knots and provide an explicit example for the unknot. This approach builds upon the ideas of Berest and Samuelson, who showed that there exists a natural DAHA action on the Kauffman bracket skein module of knot complements.</description>

      <title>The Axial Electric Potential and Length of a Torus Knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical knot theory, where knots are treated like physical objects, is important to many fields. One natural problem is to give a knot a uniform charge, and analyze the resulting electric field and electric potential. There have been some results on the number of critical points of the electric potential from knots, such as by Lipton (2021) and Lipton, Townsend, and Strogatz (2022). However, little analysis has been done on the electric field and electric potential using calculations for specific knots.
  We focus on torus knots, specifically a parametrization that embeds it on a torus centered at the origin with rotational symmetry about the z-axis. Particularly, in this project, we analyze the electric field along the z-axis to take advantage of symmetry. We also analyze the length of the knot as a simpler integral. We show that the electric field is zero only at the origin, and investigate the extreme points of the electric field and electric potential using numerical methods and calculations. We also demonstrate a new way to apply methods for contour integration in complex analysis to calculate the length, electric potential, and electric field, and provide an explicit approximation for the length of a torus knot.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Measures on Hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine semiclassical measures for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact hyperbolic $(n+1)$-manifolds. We prove their support must contain the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic submanifold. Our proof adapts the argument of Dyatlov and Jin to higher dimensions and classifies the closures of horocyclic orbits using Ratner theory. An important step in the proof is a generalization of the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen to Fourier integral operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Para-complex geometry and cyclic Higgs bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce para-complex and pseudo-Riemannian geometric methods for the study of representations of surface groups in $\mathrm{SL}(2m+1,\mathbb{R})$. For $m=1$ our techniques allow to recover several known results for Hitchin representations without any reference to convex projective geometry or hyperbolic affine spheres. In particular, we describe analytically the Guichard-Wienhard domain of discontinuity in the flag variety and the corresponding concave foliated flag structure of Nolte-Riestenberg. In higher rank, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between stable cyclic $\mathrm{SL}(2m+1,\mathbb{R})$-Higgs bundles (not necessarily in the Hitchin component) and a special class of surfaces, which we call isotropic $\mathbf{P}$-alternating, in the para-complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{2m}_{\tau}$. As a result, we give a geometric interpretation to the holomorphic differential $q_{2m+1}$ in the Hitchin base in terms of harmonic sequences for immersions in para-complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Generating the liftable mapping class groups of regular cyclic covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ be the mapping class group of the closed orientable surface of genus $g \geq 1$, and let $\mathrm{LMod}_{p}(X)$ be the liftable mapping class group associated with a finite-sheeted branched cover $p:S \to X$, where $X$ is a hyperbolic surface. For $k \geq 2$, let $p_k: S_{k(g-1)+1} \to S_g$ be the standard $k$-sheeted regular cyclic cover. In this paper, we show that $\{\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_g)\}_{k \geq 2}$ forms an infinite family of self-normalizing subgroups in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$, which are also maximal when $k$ is prime. Furthermore, we derive explicit finite generating sets for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_g)$ for $g \geq 3$ and $k \geq 2$, and $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_2}(S_2)$. For $g \geq 2$, as an application of our main result, we also derive a generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_2}(S_g) \cap C_{\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)}(\iota)$, where $C_{\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)}(\iota)$ is the centralizer of the hyperelliptic involution $\iota \in \mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the infinite ladder surface, and let $q_g : \mathcal{L} \to S_g$ be the standard infinite-sheeted cover induced by $\langle h^{g-1} \rangle$ where $h$ is the standard handle shift on $\mathcal{L}$. As a final application, we derive a finite generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_{q_g}(S_g)$ for $g \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Spinors and horospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit bijective correspondence between between nonzero pairs of complex numbers, which we regard as spinors or spin vectors, and horospheres in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space decorated with certain spinorial directions. This correspondence builds upon work of Penrose--Rindler and Penner. We show that the natural bilinear form on spin vectors describes a certain complex-valued distance between spin-decorated horospheres, generalising Penner's lambda lengths to 3 dimensions.
  From this, we derive several applications. We show that the complex lambda lengths in a hyperbolic ideal tetrahedron satisfy a Ptolemy equation. We also obtain correspondences between certain spaces of hyperbolic ideal polygons and certain Grassmannian spaces, under which lambda lengths correspond to Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, illuminating the connection between Grassmannians, hyperbolic polygons, and type A cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fine curve graph was introduced to study homeomorphism group of surfaces. In this paper we study the topology of the Gromov boundary of this graph for closed surfaces with higher genus. We first prove a bounded geodesic image theorem for the fine curve graph, a consequence of which is the non-compactness of the Gromov boundary. Using this theorem, we are able to show that the Gromov boundary is linearly connected with respect to some visual metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface is a generalization of the Jones polynomial invariant for links and plays a principal role in the Witten-Reshetikhin- Turaev topological quantum field theory. However, the multiplicative structure of the skein algebra is not well understood, with a priori exponential complexity. We consider the case of one-hole torus, and provide a polynomial algorithm for computing multiplication of any two skein elements. Some closed form formulas for multiplication of curves with low crossing number are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping class groups are known to admit geometric (proper, cobounded) actions on injective spaces. Starting with such an action, and relying only on geometric arguments, we show that all finite generating sets resulting from taking large enough balls in the respective injective space yield word metrics where pseudo-Anosov maps are exponentially generic. We also show that growth tightness holds true for the Cayley graphs corresponding to these finite generating sets, providing a positive answer to a question by Arzhantseva, Cashen and Tao.</description>

      <title>Counting subgroups via Mirzakhani's curve counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a hyperbolic surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g$ with $r$ cusps, Mirzakhani proved that the number of closed geodesics of length at most $L$ and of a given type is asymptotic to $cL^{6g-6+2r}$ for some $c&gt;0$. Since a closed geodesic corresponds to a conjugacy class of the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Sigma )$, we extend this to the counting problem of conjugacy classes of finitely generated subgroups of $\pi_1(\Sigma )$. Using `half the sum of the lengths of the boundaries of the convex core of a subgroup' instead of the length of a closed geodesic, we prove that the number of such conjugacy classes is similarly asymptotic to $cL^{6g-6+2r}$ for some $c&gt;0$. Furthermore, we see that this measurement for subgroups is `natural' within the framework of subset currents, which serve as a completion of weighted conjugacy classes of finitely generated subgroups of $\pi_1(\Sigma )$.</description>

Abstract: In all dimensions $n \ge 5$, we prove the existence of closed orientable hyperbolic manifolds that do not admit any $\text{spin}^c$ structure, and in fact we show that there are infinitely many commensurability classes of such manifolds. These manifolds all have non-vanishing third Stiefel--Whitney class $w_3$ and are all arithmetic of simplest type. More generally, we show that for each $k \ge 1$ and $n \ge 4k+1$, there exist infinitely many commensurability classes of closed orientable hyperbolic $n$-manifolds $M$ with $w_{4k-1}(M) \ne 0$.</description>

      <title>Knots and non-orientable surfaces in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new approach for describing and understanding knots and links in a 3-manifold through the use of an embedded non-orientable surface. Specifically, we define a plat-like representation based on this non-orientable surface. The method applies to manifolds of the form $M=\mathcal H\cup_{\varphi} \mathcal C(U)$ where $\mathcal H$ is a handlebody, $\mathcal C(U)$ is the mapping cylinder of the orientating two sheeted covering of a non-orientable closed surface $U$ and $\varphi:\partial \mathcal H\to \partial \mathcal C(U)$ is an attaching homeomorphism. We show that, by fixing such a splitting any link in the manifold can be represented as a plat-like closure of an element of the surface braid group of $\partial \mathcal H$. Manifolds of this type were extensively studied by J.H. Rubinstein \cite{rubinstein1978one}, where it is shown that any 3-manifold $M$, with a non-vanishing $H_2(M,\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{2\mathbb{Z}})$ will admit such a splitting. Thus the method is quite general. We provide explicit examples of such embeddings in lens spaces $L(2k,q)$ and the trivial circle bundles over orientable closed surfaces, $\Sigma\times S^1$</description>

Abstract: We propose a definition of the profinite normal structure set for the set of all manifolds in a fixed profinite homotopy type. Using this framework, we prove that the Galois action of $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ on the underlying topological manifold structures of smooth, complete, simply-connected complex varieties defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ of dimension at least $3$ factors through the abelianization of $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$. Moreover, this abelian action extends canonically to the entire profinite normal structure set. This result provides an answer to the question by Sullivan in the case of topological manifold structures of simply-connected varieties.</description>

      <title>A Basmajian-type inequality for Riemannian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore for compact Riemannian surfaces whose boundary consists of a single closed geodesic the relationship between orthospectrum and boundary length. More precisely, we establish a uniform lower bound on the boundary length in terms of the orthospectrum when fixing a metric invariant of the surface related to the classical notion of volume entropy. This inequality can be thought of as a Riemannian analog of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Transposes in the $q$-deformed modular group and their applications to $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (right) \textit{q}-deformed rational numbers was originally introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the \textit{q}-deformed modular group actions. For any matrix in this group, Leclere and Morier-Genoud showed that its trace is a palindromic polynomial whose coefficients are all non-negative (up to $\pm q^{N}$ times ). In this paper, we define the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in this group. Using this, we give new proofs of the above result and some others. We also give arithmetic properties on the left \textit{q}-rational numbers. Finally, we show that the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets implies a conjecture on the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>
