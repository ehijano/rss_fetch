      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Is a phonon excitation of a superfluid Bose gas a Goldstone boson?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that phonons in a superfluid Bose gas are Goldstone bosons. This is justified by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), which is usually defined as follows: the Hamiltonian of the system is invariant under the $U(1)$ transformation $\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}% \hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)$, whereas the order parameter $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is not. However, the strict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and the boundary conditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while the \emph{ground state} is not. Based on the latter criterion, we study a finite system of spinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches: the standard Bogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method, and the approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our results show that the answer to the question in the title is \textquotedblleft no\textquotedblright. Thus, phonons in a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose gas are similar to sound in a classical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but quantised collective vibrational modes arising from the interaction between atoms. In the case of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes paradoxical: the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate or non-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson and different from it.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear topological pumping of edge solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how nonlinear strength affects topological pumping of edge solitons by using nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For weak nonlinear strength, the introduction of nonlinearity breaks the symmetry of the energy spectrum, which makes the topological pumping from the left edge to the right edges differ from the inverse process. For moderate nonlinear strength, self-crossing structures appear in the spectrum, the right-to-left adiabatic pumping channel is destroyed, and only left-to-right topological pumping can be achieved under slow modulation. As the nonlinear strength further inreases, although left-to-right topological pumping in one pumping cycle also breaks down, we find that a thin soliton which is located in a single left edge can be mixed with the bulk soliton, and hybridized topological pumping of edge and bulk solitons can be realized after multiple pumping cycles. For stronger nonlinear strength, edge solitons are self-trapped and all topological pumping channels are shut down. Our work could trigger further studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and topology.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamics of Rogue waves, Breathers and Mixed Bound State Solutions in Spin-Orbit and Rabi Coupled Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based on an integrable model governed by four system parameters, namely, spin-orbit coupling and Rabi coupling which are constants while the other two parameters, namely the harmonic trap and scattering lengths which are time dependent, we investigate the spin orbit-Rabi coupled condensates governed by the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation. Employing Darboux transformation approach with nontrivial seed solution, we generate rogue waves, breathers, mixed rogue-dark-bright and classical dark-bright solitons. While the addition of SOC contributes to rapid oscillations in the amplitude of the rogue waves, Rabi coupling results in the appearance of stripes in the temporal direction. When the transient trap is switched on, these stripes which remain stable within the confining region, begin to overlap exponentially in the expulsive domain and eventually shrink leading to instability. We have shown that the instability arising in the rogue waves in a transient trap can be completely overcome by manipulating the scattering length through Feshbach resonance. In the case of breathers, the Rabi coupling introduces temporal stripes with single and double mode peaks around the origin while under the influence of the transient trap, the breathers get compressed and tilted. On the other hand, the amplitude of breathers which stays constant between a maxima and minima despite oscillating with time undergoes rapid fluctuations in a given spatial domain under the influence of SOC. In the case of classical dark-bright solitons, we see the flipping of dark solitons to attain positive density much similar to bright solitons under the impact of Rabi coupling. One also witnesses a 45 degree shift in the trajectory of dark and bright solitons when the transient trap is switched on. The width of the solitons widen in the confining trap while they shrink in the expulsive domain.</description>

      <title>String breaking dynamics in Ising chain with local vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics in the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in which each spin coherently interacts with its phononic mode. The model is motivated by quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms in tweezers or trapped ions. The configuration of two domain walls simulates the particle-antiparticle connecting string. We concentrate on the effect the local vibrations have on the dynamics of this initial state. Our study supplements recent investigations of string breaking, traditionally studied within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to quantum many-body systems. Two regimes are identified depending on the strength of the coupling with local vibrations. For weak coupling, the string breaking is slowed down as compared to the dynamics in an isolated Ising string. The strong coupling leads to complicated dynamics in which the domain wall character of excitation is dissolved among many coupled states.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constructive impact of Wannier-Stark field on environment-boosted quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the ground states of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model as the battery's initial state, we demonstrate that using the Wannier-Stark (WS) field for charging in addition to onsite interactions can increase the maximum power of the battery. Although the benefit is not ubiquitous, bosonic batteries are more affected by the WS field than fermionic ones. In particular, there exists a critical WS field strength above which the power gets increased in the battery. Further, we determine a closed form expression of the stored work when the battery is in the ground state of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model with only hopping term and the charging is carried out with onsite interactions and WS field irrespective of lattice-size of the battery. Moreover, we exhibit that it is possible to extract work in the fermionic batteries even without charging when the edge sites are attached to two local thermal baths having high temperatures -- this process we refer to as {\it environment-assisted ergotropy}. Note, however, that the bosonic batteries are able to exhibit such an environmental benefit in the transient regime when the lattice-size is increased and when Wannier-Stark field is present. Nonetheless, if the onsite interaction or WS potential with a critical strength is utilized as a charger, energy can be stored and extracted from both bosonic and fermionic batteries in the presence of the thermal baths.</description>

      <title>Photon Bose-Condensate as a Tunable Terahertz Laser Source without Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model for a tunable coherent terahertz radiation source based on the long-lived Bose condensate of photons. In the device we propose, the original photon pumping is performed incoherently by a blackbody radiation emitter. The photons thus produced Bose-condense by the inelastic relaxation on a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetostatic field. The process involves neither population inversion nor light wave amplification the standard laser sources are built on. The coherence and tunability of the light emitted by such a photon condensate are provided and supported by the discrete spectrum of the electron gas in the quantizing magnetic field. The device is a compact-size semiconductor crystal. We propose the design and perform the realistic calculations of the physical properties and limiting factors for the terahertz photon Bose-condensate resonator. We show that our terahertz source can deliver the highly coherent light emission in the frequency range of 3-30 THz for the magnetic field induction of the order of 2 T, with the upper emission frequency limit adjustable by the strength of the magnetic field applied.</description>

      <title>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of molecular orientations: topological classification, complete entanglement, and fault-tolerant encodings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, we reproduce a molecule's admissible angular momentum states known from spectroscopy, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how the state space of a molecular species is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify molecular species whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</description>
