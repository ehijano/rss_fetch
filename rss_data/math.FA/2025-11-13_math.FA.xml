      <title>Bounded sequences having an even number of accumulation points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their papers, Leonetti, Russo, Somaglia, Menet and Papathanasiou posed the question of whether there exists an infinite dimensional vector space of sequences in $\ell_\infty$ having (except for the zero sequence) an even amount of accumulation points. Here we answer this question in the negative, by showing that this previous set of sequences is not even $3$-lineable and, therefore, not lineable.</description>

      <title>Rational Orthonormal Littlewood-Paley Wavelet Basis of L2(R)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, first, we prove that the orthonormal basis of rational Littlewood-Paley wavelet with rational dilation factor M=p/q first proposed by Auscher does not hold for all rational numbers. It does not hold if q is not equal to 1. In other words, it is not an orthonormal basis if the rational dilation factor M is not an integer. Then, to make up for the shortcoming of the rational Littlewood-Paley wavelet proposed by Auscher, a new orthonormal basis of rational Littlewood-Paley wavelet with rational dilation factor M=p/q is proposed, which holds for all rational numbers. Finally, by means of sampling theorem for bandpass signals, it is proved completely that the new rational Littlewood-Paley wavelet family is an orthonormal wavelet basis of L2(R).</description>

      <title>Rademacher's Theorem for Calderon-Zygmund-type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rademacher's Theorem is a classical result stating that a Lipschitz function on $\mathbb{R}^d$ possesses a total differential almost everywhere. This implies that if $f$ is a function defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$ belonging to the Calder\'on--Zygmund space $T^\infty_1(x)$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$, then $f \in t^\infty_1(x)$ for almost every $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$.
  The main purpose of this paper is to extend this property to a broader functional framework. More precisely, we replace the Lipschitz condition by the assumption that $f$ belongs to a general weighted Calder\'on--Zygmund space $T^p_{\phi}(x)$ for $x \in E$, where $E$ is a measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\phi$ is a weight with fractional indices. We then show that, under suitable assumptions, the function belongs to $t^p_{\phi}(x)$ for almost every $x \in E$.
  The result can be obtained either by imposing additional hypotheses or by working within a suitably adapted $t^p_{\phi}$ space. Whenever relevant, we also provide counterexamples illustrating the sharpness and the limitations of the statement.</description>

      <title>Fej\'er--Riesz factorization for positive noncommutative trigonometric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Fej\'er-Riesz type factorization for positive matrix-valued noncommutative trigonometric polynomials on $\mathscr{W}\times\mathfrak{Y}$, where $\mathscr{W}$ is either the free semigroup $\langle x \rangle_g$ or the free product group $\mathbb{Z}_2^{g}$, and $\mathfrak{Y}$ is a discrete group. More precisely, using the shortlex order, if $A$ has degree at most $w$ in the $\mathscr{W}$ variables and is uniformly strictly positive on all unitary representations of $\mathscr{W}\times\mathfrak{Y}$, then $A=B^{*}B$ with $B$ analytic and of $\mathscr{W}$-degree at most $w$; this degree bound is optimal, and strict positivity is essential. As an application, we obtain degree-bounded sums-of-squares certificates for Bell-type inequalities in $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}_2^{*g}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{*h}]$ from quantum information theory.
  In the special case $\mathscr{W}=\mathbb{Z}^h$ we recover, in the matrix-valued setting, the classical commutative multivariable Fej\'er-Riesz factorization. For trivial $\mathfrak{Y}$ we obtain a ``perfect'' group-algebra Positivstellensatz on $\mathbb{Z}_2^{*g}$ that does not require strict positivity; this result is sharp, as demonstrated by counterexamples in $\mathbb{Z}_2*\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3^{*2}$.
  To establish our main results two novel ingredients of independent interest are developed: (a) a positive-semidefinite Parrott theorem with entries given by functions on a group; and (b) solutions to positive semidefinite matrix completion problems for $\langle x \rangle_g$ or the free product group $\mathbb{Z}_2^{*g}$ indexed by words in $\mathscr{W}$ of length $\le w$.</description>

Abstract: We establish several sufficient conditions under which a locally integrable function $f:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ represents a positive-definite distribution. In particular we consider functions of the form $f(\|x\|)$ where $\|\cdot\|$ is a fixed norm in $\mathbb R^n$.</description>

      <title>Abelian and Tauberian results for the fractional Hankel transform in Zemanian-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present an Abelian-type theorem for the fractional Hankel transform (FrHT) within Zemanian generalized function spaces. To prove this, we show that these spaces have the Montel property. Next, we construct a new Zemanian-type space as a projective limit of suitable Banach spaces. Its dual is the largest known distribution space admitting the FrHT. Finally, within this extended setting, we establish new Abelian and Tauberian-type results for the FrHT.</description>

      <title>The Principal Ideal Theorem in Spectral Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an earlier paper we solved a long-standing problem which goes back to Laurent Schwartz's work on mean-periodic functions. Namely, we completely characterised those locally compact Abelian groups having spectral synthesis. The method is based on the localisation concept. In this paper we show that localisation can be used to prove another basic result in spectral synthesis: the principal ideal theorem.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in new index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian correlation inequality for centered convex sets and the case of equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Milman's recent observation, we prove that the Gaussian correlation inequality holds for convex sets having the same barycenter, and especially for centered ones. This gives an affirmative answer to the problem proposed by Szarek and Werner. We also characterize the equality case. The study of the equality case in the non-symmetric Gaussian correlation inequality relates to the following question: Let $X$ be a standard Gaussian random vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. For which convex sets $K_1,K_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, are the two events $\{X\in K_1\}$ and $\{X\in K_2\}$ independent? By imposing an additional normalization that $K_1$ and $K_2$ have the same barycenter, we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for this independence. The conditions also identify when $\|X\|_{K_1}$ and $\|X\|_{K_2}$ are independent as random variables.</description>

      <title>Norm of the Hilbert matrix operator on logarithmically weighted Bloch and Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the exact value of the norm of the Hilbert matrix operator $\mathcal{H}$ acting from the classical Bloch space $\mathcal{B}$ into the logarithmically weighted Bloch space $\mathcal{B}_{\log}$, and show that it equals $\frac{3}{2}$; we also find that the norm from the space of bounded analytic functions $H^\infty$ into the logarithmically weighted Hardy space $H^{\infty}_{\log}$ is $1$. Furthermore, we establish both lower and upper bounds for the norm of $\mathcal{H}$ when it maps from the $\alpha$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha$ into the logarithmically weighted $\mathcal{B}^\alpha_{\log}$ with $1 &lt;\alpha &lt; 2$, and from the Hardy space $H^{1}$ into the logarithmically weighted Hardy space $H^{1}_{\log}$.</description>

      <title>Matrix Concentration Inequalities and Free Probability II. Two-sided Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new family of nonasymptotic matrix concentration inequalities that sharply capture the spectral properties of very general random matrices in terms of an associated noncommutative model. These methods achieved matching upper and lower bounds for smooth spectral statistics, but only provided upper bounds for the spectral edges. Here we obtain matching lower bounds for the spectral edges, completing the theory initiated in the first paper.
  The resulting two-sided bounds enable the study of problems that require an exact determination of the spectral edges to leading order, which is fundamentally beyond the reach of classical matrix concentration inequalities. To illustrate their utility, we develop two general results that explain phase transitions of spectral outliers of a large class of nonhomogeneous random matrices. This enables us to elucidate phase transition phenomena that arise in diverse applications, including decoding node labels on graphs, tensor PCA, contextual stochastic block models, and centered sample covariance matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smocked spaces are a class of metric spaces which were introduced to generalize pulled thread spaces. We investigate convergence of these spaces, showing that if the underlying smocking sets converge in Hausdorff distance and satisfy local uniform bounds on the smocking constants, then the associated smocked spaces converge in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We prove a corresponding precompactness result using a similar assumption on the smocking constants. We also show that every finite-dimensional normed vector space arises as the tangent cone at infinity of a suitably constructed smocked space. Finally, we extend the convergence theory to the setting of smocked metric measure spaces, proving stability under pointed measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. These results establish a basic geometric framework for smocked spaces and demonstrate that they exhibit controlled limit behavior.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Kulikov (\cite{Ku}) has shown that certain convex functionals on weighted Bergman spaces are maximized by reproducing kernels. We prove sharp quantitative stability of these estimates with the optimal norm and the exponent and explicit constant. Several applications of the result are given - recovering the appropriate result for Fock spaces, relation to wavelet transform, Hardy space conuterpart for functionals induced by increasing function.</description>

      <title>Sharp Schoenberg type inequalities and the de Bruin--Sharma problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Schoenberg inequality relates the squared moduli of the critical points of a polynomial to those of its zeros, under the condition that the centroid of the zeros lies at the origin. Its generalizations to other orders are referred to as Schoenberg type inequalities. While higher-order analogues have been established for certain even exponents, the general case remains poorly understood. In this paper, we substantially extend the known results by introducing an interpolation-based framework that unifies the treatment of Schoenberg type inequalities across a continuum of exponents. Our approach employs complex interpolation between $\ell^p$ spaces and Schatten $p$-classes $S_p$, yielding sharp Schoenberg type inequalities of order $p$ for all $p \ge 1$, including previously inaccessible intermediate exponents. This completely resolves an open problem posed by Kushel and Tyaglov~\cite{KT16}. In the process, we also provide a new proof of the Schoenberg type inequality of order $1$.
  Moreover, we confirm two conjectured quartic inequalities proposed by Georgiev, G\'{o}mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner~\cite{GGTW25}, thereby providing a complete solution to the de Bruin--Sharma problem. We show that both conjectures follow by combining the results of Cheung--Ng and Kushel--Tyaglov with new sharp inequalities for the zero configuration, which are of independent interest. In the course of this investigation, we also discuss the optimal constants in Schoenberg type inequalities of order $p&gt;2$ for odd $n&gt;4$.</description>
