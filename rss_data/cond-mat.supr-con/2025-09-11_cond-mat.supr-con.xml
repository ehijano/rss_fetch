      <title>Structural Phase Separation and Enhanced Superconductivity in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 under Uniaxial Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its capability in tuning lattice and electronic structures of quantum materials. Using moderate uniaxial compressive strain, we induce structural phase separation in the low-temperature phase of x=1/8 La2-xBaxCuO4 (LBCO) single crystals. These structures are low temperature tetragonal (LTT), low temperature less orthorhombic (LTLO), and a plastically deformed nano-domain structure (PDNS), comprised of few-nanometer-sized orthorhombic domains within an amorphous matrix. These three structures exhibit distinct superconducting behaviors. The volume fraction of the LTT structure is suppressed with increasing strain, while its superconducting transition temperature increases and broadens. The LTLO structure exhibits a sharp superconducting transition above 32 K, which increases up to ~36 K at maximum strain. The PDNS phase exhibits a very broad superconducting transition and persists even after removing the strain. Our study illustrates the sensitivity of superconductivity to the structure of the LBCO sample near its stripe instability.</description>

      <title>Electrically Controlled 0-$\pi$ Oscillations and Josephson Giant Magnetoresistor with PT-Symmetric Antiferromagnetic Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that unconventional Josephson effects typically emerge in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer systems. When proximitized by a conventional superconductor, these systems host dominant interlayer Cooper pairing that features a distinctive spin texture enabled by the strong exchange field. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for electrically tunable 0-$\pi$ oscillations in lateral Josephson junctions, controlled by an out-of-plane electric displacement field. This behavior originates from field-induced finite-momentum Cooper pairing, a hallmark of the unique layer-pseudospin structure in {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers. Furthermore, we introduce a Josephson giant magnetoresistor based on these exotic spin-layer-locked Cooper pairs, in which the supercurrent exhibits a strong dependence on the internal N\'{e}el order. Our findings establish {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers as a versatile platform for phase-controllable Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic random-access memory, with promising applications in superconducting circuits and ultralow-power computing.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Phase-Transition Framework for Gate-Tunable Superconductivity in Monolayer WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported gate-tunable superconductivity in monolayer WTe$_2$ exhibits several striking anomalies beyond the standard paradigm, including a contrasting carrier-density dependence of the transition temperature $T_c$ in weakly and strongly disordered regimes and more surprisingly, the sudden disappearance of superconducting fluctuations below a critical carrier density. To understand these features, we go beyond the mean-field theory to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density by explicitly incorporating both Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase fluctuations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations are minimal in the weak-disorder regime but become crucial under strong disorder, where the zero-temperature gap renormalized by NG quantum fluctuations becomes density-dependent while the BKT fluctuations drive the superconducting $T_c$ below the gap-closing temperature. Simulations within this unified framework combining with the density-functional-theory input to account for the excitonic instability quantitatively reproduced nearly all key experimental observations in monolayer WTe$_2$, providing a consistent understanding of reported anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in nickelate compounds has opened new avenues in the study of high-temperature superconductors. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the field, including all different nickelate systems, reduced-Ruddlesden-Popper-type infinite layer LaNiO$_2$, Ruddlesden-Popper-type bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We begin by introducing the superconducting properties of the hole-doped LaNiO$_2$ system, which marked the starting point for nickelate superconductivity. We then turn to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system, discussing both its high-pressure and thin-film superconducting phases. This is followed by an examination of the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ system and other related multilayer nickelates. Throughout the review, we highlight emerging trends, key challenges, and open questions. We conclude by addressing current limitations in materials synthesis and characterization, and future directions that may help uncover the mechanisms driving superconductivity in these complex oxide systems.</description>

      <title>Weakly superconducting anisotropy in 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 with 1T/1H heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) exhibit rich physical properties by the combination of strong electronic correlation effects in 1T layer and superconductivity in 1H layer. But the limited number of bulk TMD materials with such heterostructures impedes the in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms behind these properties, as well as research on tuning of these properties. Here, we report a systematic study on physical properties of the 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 single crystals with 1T/1H heterostructure. It exhibits a superconducting transition at temperature below 3.3 K. Further analysis indicates that 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 is an intermediately coupled type-II superconductor. Moreover, 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 shows a rather weak superconducting anisotropy (~ 2), distinctly different from other known TMD superconductors with 4Hb heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Absence of two-orbital superconductivity in cuprate family: A DFT+DMFT perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous mechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question: can cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar two-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our calculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly correlated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find that the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around +2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is attributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this mechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics consistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials like the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ that appear structurally primed for two-orbital activity. Our results therefore conclude that the route towards two-orbital superconductivity is fundamentally obstructed in cuprates, providing a crucial constraint for the future design of high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Terahertz nonlinear response in cuprate superconductors and the Higgs field in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A puzzling phenomenon has been recently revealed in terahertz nonlinear optical response experiments: A third harmonic generation (THG) signal, identified only in the superconducting (SC) phase in a conventional BCS superconductor, is found to persist into a wide pseudogap regime in the underdoped cuprate, accompanied by a $\pi$ phase shift in the THG signal across the SC transition. In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such an unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed holons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase (LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase coherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like responses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations described by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external electromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the SC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $\pi$ phase shift with a substantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</description>

      <title>Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals superconductors are attracting much attention owing to their rich phase diagrams including possible unconventional superconductivity. However, they suffer from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

Abstract: In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-$T_c$ YBCO superconducting waveguides with 104-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies as a function of temperature and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.</description>

      <title>An $ab\;initio$ answer to long-debated questions about superconducting Nb$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures, yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.00523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductivity, the Cooper pair \cite{Ref1} is a bound state of a pair of weakly interacting electrons in a metal which forces us to insert a factor of $2e$ (instead of $e$) in the phase of the wave function in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We claim that the existence of such a factor is universal. In \cite{Ref2}, we proposed an explanation for the AB effect (or equivalently, a supersymmetric Dirac monopole) based on SUSY. It is shown that this model opens a path to recapture this factor without the need for arguments related to attractive pairs. The idea is also applied to the case of a nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) when it is coupled to $\mathcal{N}=1$, supergravity.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Possible Sliding Regimes in Twisted Bilayer WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of increasingly one-dimensional (1D) behavior with decreasing temperature in small-angle twisted bilayers of WTe$_2$ (tWTe$_2$), we theoretically explore the exotic sliding regimes that could be realized in tWTe$_2$. At zero displacement field, while hole-doped tWTe$_2$ can be thought of as an array of weakly coupled conventional two-flavor 1D electron gases (1DEGs), the electron-doped regime is equivalent to coupled four-flavor 1DEGs , due to the presence of an additional "valley'' degree of freedom. In the decoupled limit, the electron-doped system can thus realize phases with a range of interesting ordering tendencies, including $4k_F$ charge-density-wave and charge-$4e$ superconductivity. Dimensional crossovers and cross-wire transport due to inter-wire couplings of various kinds are also discussed. We find that a sliding Luther-Emery liquid with small inter-wire couplings is probably most consistent with current experiments on hole-doped tWTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric processes of quantum normal-superconductor interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting interfaces have recently been demonstrated to contain a rich variety of effects that give rise to sizable thermoelectric responses and unexpected thermal properties, despite traditionally being considered poor thermoelectrics due to their intrinsic electron-hole symmetry. We review different mechanisms driving this response in hybrid normal-superconducting junctions, depending on the dimensionality of the mesoscopic interface. In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.</description>
