      <title>A Unified Representation and Transformation of Electromagnetic Configurations Based on Generalized Hertz Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework that fully represents electromagnetic potentials, fields, and sources in vacuum, based on a reinterpretation of the classical Hertz-potential formalism. In this construction, $\phi$, $A$, $E$, $B$, $\rho$, and $J$ are systematically derived from a single vector wavefield $\Gamma(x, t)$ (called the "$\Gamma$-potential"), which is structurally aligned with the classical electric Hertz potential but of broader scope. A surjective mapping is established from such wavefields to all electromagnetic configurations in vacuum (that are sufficiently regular). This mapping induces a well-defined algebraic correspondence between the solution space of Maxwell's equations and the linear space of $C_t^{3} C_x^{3}$ vector wavefields (modulo the relevant symmetries), thereby enabling a framework for structural analysis of electromagnetic fields via their associated wavefields. Gauge freedom and the Lorenz gauge are naturally preserved; charge conservation and Maxwell's equations are inherently encoded in this representation.
  Building on this framework, we also introduce a transformation that provides a systematic method for generating new electromagnetic solutions from known ones. This transformation, called the "$\Gamma$-transformation", generalizes classical gauge transformations and may facilitate the exploration of hidden structures and symmetries in the solution space of Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Unifying Frictional Transients Reveals the Origin of Static Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional motion is harder to initiate than to sustain, as evident when pushing a heavy object. This disparity between static and kinetic friction drives instabilities and stick-slip dynamics in systems ranging from nanodevices and MEMS to squealing brakes, glaciers and tectonic faults, yet its origin and the transition mechanism remain poorly understood. Empirical rate-and-state friction laws predict that during the static-to-kinetic transition, friction increases for nanometer-per-second slip rates, but decreases for micrometers-per-second rates and above. These transients are believed to be associated with contact strengthening (aging) at static interfaces, although their physical basis is unclear and the crossover between regimes has never been observed directly. Here we show, through nanometer-resolution sliding experiments on macroscopic rough surfaces, that these transients are segments of a single, universal non-monotonic response whose peak defines static friction. We show that this behavior arises from mechanical reorganization of interlocking surface asperities under shear, fundamentally distinct from contact aging, which is governed by thermal molecular processes. We derive, from first principles and without invoking any empirical postulates, a differential equation that quantitatively captures the friction peak. These results unify frictional transients across scales and speeds, and establish a physics-based framework for understanding frictional instabilities and failure processes in engineering and geosciences.</description>
