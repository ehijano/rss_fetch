      <title>Ge as an ideal orbitronic platform: giant orbital Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for \textit{orbitronic} materials displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system with \textit{inversion symmetry}. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Landau Levels in Inhomogeneous Fluxes and Emergent Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional systems in magnetic fields host rich physics, most notably the quantum Hall effect arising from Landau level quantization. In a broad class of two-dimensional models, flat bands with topologically nontrivial band degeneracies give rise to anomalous Landau level quantization under homogeneous fields. Ascribed to the underlying quantum geometry, these are classified as singular flat bands, exhibiting unusual wavefunction localization, and anomalous quantization of Landau levels. We investigate the response of gapless singular flat bands to inhomogeneous fluxes, bridging continuum and lattice descriptions. Our analysis reveals a mechanism to controllably manipulate the anomalous Landau levels via flux inhomogeneity. We further uncover an emergent supersymmetry in the parameter space where the tower of anomalous Landau levels collapses to zero energy, rendering a lattice analog of the Aharonov-Casher theorem on degenerate zero modes in perpendicular fluxes, with wavefunction localization partly similar to Aharonov-Bohm caging. With the addition of strong correlations, these findings will have implications for realizing exotic topological and charge-ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Magnon-magnon coupling efficiency of $\eta$=0.5 in weakly pinned synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) consist of two ferromagnetic layers that are antiferromagnetically coupled. These systems support complex dynamical magnetic excitations, where interlayer coupling gives rise to both in-phase (acoustic) and anti-phase (optical) magnonic modes. Typically, simultaneous excitation of both modes requires breaking the symmetry between the ferromagnetic layers -- commonly achieved through slight misalignment of the experimental setup or by modifying the intrinsic magnetic properties. In our approach, we utilize a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet (pSAF), where one of the ferromagnetic layers is exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnet. We demonstrate that by tuning the thickness of the antiferromagnet and slightly enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer, both acoustic and optical modes can be efficiently excited -- without the need for experimental misalignment or changes to the intrinsic material properties. Under specific conditions, the magnon dispersion relations exhibit anti-crossing behavior, resulting in the emergence of a magnonic bandgap -- a clear signature of strong magnon-magnon coupling. The coupling efficiency $\eta$, defined as the ratio between the bandgap and the characteristic frequency, reaches $\eta = 0.5$, approaching the ultra-strong coupling regime ($\eta = 1$). The combination of strong mode hybridization, a sizable magnonic bandgap, and high ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) coherence over large areas -- all achieved at room temperature without cryogenic cooling -- underscores the potential of these systems for quantum magnonic applications, including quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Classical and single photon memory devices based on polariton lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated scattering of incoherent excitons into an exciton-polariton mode leads to the build-up of a polariton condensate whose polarization is sensitive to a small seeded population that triggers the stimulated process. We show, within a semiclassical stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii model, that this mechanism enables a robust polarization memory operation: the condensate tends to align its Stokes vector with that of the seed and to maintain it for times far exceeding an individual polariton lifetime. Importantly, this single-photon-seeded regime is modeled as an initial weak excitation of the condensate mode. We quantify the memory performance by a classical polarization-alignment metric and find that the seed polarization can remain well preserved on a nanosecond timescale under realistic parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric induced nonlinear thermal noise in PT-symmetric antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical current fluctuations provide a powerful and unconventional probe of band geometry in quantum materials. In particular, intrinsic noise components that are independent of the relaxation time reveal universal band-geometric properties of Bloch electrons. Here, we identify a distinct intrinsic contribution to current noise at second order in the electric field, which is governed by the quantum metric. This effect arises from field-induced modifications to Bloch wavefunctions and band energies, and it dominates in PT-symmetric antiferromagnets where Berry curvature based contributions are forbidden by symmetry. Applying our theory to CuMnAs, we demonstrate that thermal noise provides a direct signature of quantum metric in PT-symmetric antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial topology in one- and two-dimensional asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays an important role in the topological band theory. In contrary, study on the topological properties of the asymmetric systems is rather limited, especially in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we explore a new theory to study the topology in various one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states. Starting from the simple SSHm model, we show the chiral topology of its edge states by redefining sublattices. Meanwhile, based on its Rice-Mele-like effective Hamiltonian, a new topological invariant $\bar{Z}$ can be defined and the bulk-edge correspondence is established. With this clear physical picture, our theory can be extended to the more complex asymmetric ladder models, or even the 2D asymmetric systems. In the 2D BBH3 model, new chiral corner states with redefined lattices are found based on our method. These corner states are independent of any spatial symmetry and exhibit the characteristics of topological bound states in the continuum (TBICs). Moreover, the topological invariant can be calculated by introducing $\bar{Z}$ into 2D. At last, we propose an acoustic experiment of the BBH3 model where chiral corner states are numerically observed. Our work exhibits a new approach to study the topological properties of asymmetric systems. By redefining sublattices, we find that the models with entirely different structures might share the same topological origins.</description>

      <title>Tracking spin qubit frequency variations over 912 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state qubits are sensitive to their microscopic environment, causing the qubit properties to fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. The sub-Hz end of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations, which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics. In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of a six-qubit device vary by up to $\pm 100$ MHz while performing a variety of experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept constant to within 15 $\mathrm{\mu}$V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than $\pm 7$ MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise spectral density shows roughly a $1/f$ trend above $10^{-4}$ Hz and, strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>Spin band geometry drives intrinsic thermal spin magnetization and current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating spin magnetization and spin currents without magnetic or electric fields is a key frontier in spin caloritronics. Spin responses driven by thermal gradients offer a promising route, though the band geometric origin of intrinsic mechanisms, especially in non-magnetic materials, remains poorly understood. Here we develop a unified quantum theory of thermal spin magnetization and spin currents in itinerant electrons, rooted in spin band geometry with both Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea contributions. We identify two key geometric quantities: the spin-velocity metric tensor, which governs thermal spin magnetization, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry curvature and spin quantum metric, which generates thermal spin currents. These intrinsic contributions persist and can even dominate in non-magnetic insulators. Numerical calculations for chiral metal RhGe and antiferromagnet CuMnAs demonstrate sizable thermal spin responses near band crossings. Our results establish the band geometric origin of thermal spin transport and provide guiding principles for discovering and engineering next-generation spin caloritronic materials.</description>

      <title>Revisiting dissipation-driven phase transition in a Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work over several decades, Schmid-Bulgadaev quantum phase transition remains a subject of debate. Here we revisit this problem by performing systematic experiments on low-frequency current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions over a wide range of parameters. The experiments are conducted in a true resistive environment formed by a metallic on-chip resistor located near the junction. Over the parameter range of the experiment, we find that the transition occurs when the resistance crosses the quantum value $h/(4e^2)\simeq 6.5$ k$\Omega$ for Cooper pairs, as originally predicted. The temperature $T$ of the experiment is naturally non-zero, but our basic theoretical modeling corroborates that the observations under these conditions can serve as the basis for the conclusions made, in particular, the crossover resistance from superconducting to insulating regime is the same as that at $T=0$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metal and topological phases in the ferrovalley states of the sliding bilayer altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is characterized by non-relativistic spin splitting and zero total magnetic moments. In this work, intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metallic and topological phases were discovered within the ferrovalley states of sliding bilayer altermagnets. We construct the bilayer system by utilizing altermagnet monolayers with a small bandgap. The inter-layer hopping phenomenon leads to a reduction in bandgaps, and sliding engineering induces ferrovalley states. Taking the V$_2$OSSe system for example, first-principles calculations indicate that the spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the ferrovalley state ensures a direct gap in one valley (one spin channel) and band inversion in the other valley (opposite spin channel), which is manifested as an intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metal. The microscopic model and effective Hamiltonian employed in this research confirm the universal spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Further calculations imply the existence of Chern insulator and gapless surface states in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Adjusting the sliding direction can achieve the transition between different half-metals with conducting electrons of different spins, accompanied by the switching of gapless surface states of opposite spins. This research lays a foundation for the potential applications of intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metals and topological phases in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Nanoimprinted topological laser in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a widely used high-throughput fabrication technique for photonic devices, yet its reliability is often compromised by the inevitable imperfections that arise during the demolding process. Topological photonics, which harnesses topologically nontrivial structures to support defect-robust photonic states, offers a promising solution to this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a topological laser that is one-step nanoimprinted upon colloidal perovskite nanocrystals. This laser features multiple higher-order topological corner states, with topological protection provided by the structure effectively mitigating imperfections caused by the nanoimprinting process. This property enables the reliable detection of these states, which is particularly challenging to achieve in the visible spectrum. Our work establishes topological photonics as a viable pathway to enhance the reliability of NIL-based manufacturing, providing a scalable and practical route for mass-producing topological lasers with low-index materials.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis Measurements as a Diagnostic Tool: A Systematic Approach for Stability Benchmarking and Performance Projection of 2D-Materials-Based MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Judging by its omnipresence in the literature, the hysteresis observed in the transfer characteristics of emerging transistors based on 2D-materials is widely accepted as an important metric related to the device quality. The hysteresis is often reported with attributes like "negligible" or "small" without giving any specifics as to how this was determined and against what reference the measured values were compared to. Quite surprisingly, there appears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually contributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on various experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms contributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the gate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue by suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena. Based on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis values have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under arbitrary conditions. In order to resolve this predicament, we propose a standardized hysteresis measurement scheme to establish the hysteresis as a comparable metric for the assessment of device stability. Our standardized scheme ensures that hysteresis data can be effectively compared across different technologies and, most importantly, provide a means to extrapolate data obtained on thicker prototypes to subnanometer equivalent oxide thicknesses. This facilitates the systematic benchmarking of insulator/channel combinations in terms of stability, which thereby enables the screening of material systems for more stable and reliable 2D-material-based MOSFETs.</description>

      <title>Model for missing Shapiro steps due to bias-dependent resistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes are predicted in several solid state systems such as hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures and topological insulators coupled to superconductors. One of the expected signatures of Majorana modes is the fractional 4$\pi$ Josephson effect. Evidence in favor of this effect often comes from a.c. Josephson effect measurements and focuses on the observation of missing first or higher odd-numbered Shapiro steps. However, the disappearance of the odd Shapiro steps has also been reported in conventional Josephson junctions where no Majorana modes are expected. In this paper, we present a phenomenological model that displays suppression of the odd Shapiro steps. We perform resistively-shunted junction model calculations and introduce peaks in differential resistance as function of the bias current. In the presence of only the standard 2$\pi$ Josephson current, for chosen values of peak positions and amplitudes, we can suppress the odd Shapiro steps, or any steps, thus providing a possible explanation for the observation of missing Shapiro steps.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Limit of MOSFET Subthreshold Swing at Sub-Kelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully conductive band tails cause the subthreshold swing to saturate at temperatures above 1 K. However, recent measurements indicate that below 1 K, the subthreshold swing in certain MOSFET structures resumes a linear scaling with temperature. Following this ultra-steep behavior, a new type of plateau has been measured below 1 K. In this letter, we show that hybrid band tails, with both traps and mobile states, explain this new plateau. Furthermore, hybrid band tails explain various non-saturating behaviors above 1 K. Remarkably, for entirely non-conductive band tails, the simulations and theory predict a third type of plateau below 10 mK. We hypothesize that this represents the lower bound of subthreshold swing at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which is a testable prediction from the theory.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a non-zero spectral winding number. Beyond the spinless frameworks considered so far, here we realize a generic, tunable spinful NHSE in a 1D tight-binding lattice endowed with spin-dependent Abelian gauge fields. With proper tuning of the gauge parameter, we uncover an emergence of bidirected, spin-polarized zero-winding skin states, appearing in the absence of transpose-type time-reversal symmetry (T RS{\dag}) and featuring scale-restricted localization with non-Bloch spectral stability. While clearly distinct from the known Z2 and Critical NHSEs, these unconventional skin states evolve into them upon enforcing TRS{\dag} and introducing inter-spin coupling via magnetic fields, respectively. The magnetic field further drives a transition from a bidirectional to a unidirectional skin configuration. Our work unifies the previously known zero-winding NHSEs within a broader framework and provides experimentally accessible routes for realization in photonic and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and transport in materials with flat bands: 2D materials and quasicrystals</title>

Abstract: In this review, we present recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are due to specific atomic order effects without electron interactions. These states are always indicative of some form of confinement and have consequences on the electronic properties. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene (TBG) or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms). We have shown that their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In the case of TBG, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on two-dimensional nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require post-selection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically exact few-body algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region, e.g., InAs on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>
