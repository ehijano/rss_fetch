      <title>A New Proof of Sub-Gaussian Norm Concentration Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new proof of the sub-Gaussian norm concentration inequality. Our proof is based on an averaged version of the moment generating function termed the averaged moment generating function. Compared with the widely adopted $\varepsilon$-net technique-based proof of the sub-Gaussian norm concentration inequality, our method does not rely on the union bound and promises a tighter concentration bound.</description>

      <title>A new bound in Majority Dynamics on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of majority dynamics on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi $G(n,p)$ random graphs. In this process, each vertex of a graph is assigned one of two initial states. Subsequently, on every day, each vertex simultaneously updates its state to the most common state in its neighbourhood.
  If the difference in the number of vertices in each state on day $0$ is much larger than $ \max \left\{p^{-1/2} \sqrt{\log\left(\frac{1}{p}\right)}, p^{-3/2}n^{-1/2}\right\}$, we demonstrate that the state with the initial majority wins with overwhelmingly high probability. This extends work by Linh Tran and Van Vu (2023), who previously considered this phenomenon.
  We also study majority dynamics with a random initial assignment of vertex states. When each vertex is assigned to a state with equal probability, we show that unanimity occurs with arbitrarily high probability for every $p \geq \lambda n^{-2/3}$, for some constant $\lambda$. This improves work by Fountoulakis, Kang and Makai (2020).
  Furthermore, we also consider a random initial assignment of vertex states where a vertex is slightly more likely to be in the first state than the second state. Previous work by Zehmakan (2018) and Tran and Vu (2023) provided conditions on how big this bias needs to be for the first colour to achieve unanimity with high probability. We strengthen these results by providing that a weaker sufficient condition.</description>

      <title>Explosion speed of continuous state branching processes indexed by the Esscher transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A branching process $Z$ is said to be non conservative if it hits $\infty$ in a finite time with positive probability. It is well known that this happens if and only if the branching mechanism $\varphi$ of $Z$ satisfies $\int_{0+}d\lambda/|\varphi(\lambda)|&lt;\infty$. We construct on the same probability space a family of conservative continuous state branching processes $Z^{(\varepsilon)}$, $\varepsilon\ge0$, each process $Z^{(\varepsilon)}$ having $\varphi^{(\varepsilon)}(\lambda)=\varphi(\lambda+\varepsilon)-\varphi(\varepsilon)$ as branching mechanism, and such that the family $Z^{(\varepsilon)}$, $\varepsilon\ge0$ converges a.s.~to $Z$, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$. Then we study the speed of convergence of $Z^{(\varepsilon)}$, when $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$, referred to here as the explosion speed. More specifically, we characterize the functions $f$ with $\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0} f(\varepsilon)=\infty$ and such that the first passage times $\sigma_\varepsilon=\inf\{t:Z^{(\varepsilon)}_t\ge f(\varepsilon)\}$ converge toward the explosion time of $Z$. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the weak convergence and convergence in $L^1$. Then we give a sufficient condition for the almost sure convergence.</description>

      <title>Recovering Parameters from Edge Fluctuations: Beta-Ensembles and Critically-Spiked Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda=\{\Lambda_0,\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2,\ldots\}$ be the point process that describes the edge scaling limit of either (i) "regular" beta-ensembles with inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$, or (ii) the top eigenvalues of Wishart or Gaussian invariant random matrices perturbed by $r_0\geq1$ critical spikes. In other words, $\Lambda$ is the eigenvalue point process of one of the scalar or multivariate stochastic Airy operators. We prove that a single observation of $\Lambda$ suffices to recover (almost surely) either (i) $\beta$ in the case of beta-ensembles, or (ii) $r_0$ in the case of critically-spiked models. Our proof relies on the recently-developed semigroup theory for the multivariate stochastic Airy operators.
  Going beyond these parameter-recovery applications, our results also (iii) refine our understanding of the rigidity properties of $\Lambda$, and (iv) shed new light on the equality (in distribution) of stochastic Airy spectra with different dimensions and the same Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Strong local uniqueness for the vacant set of random interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the the vacant set $\mathcal{V}^u$ of random interlacements on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. For varying intensity $u &gt; 0$, the connectivity properties of $\mathcal V^u$ undergo a percolation phase transition across a non-degenerate critical parameter $u_* \in (0,\infty)$. As a consequence of the series of recent works arXiv:2308.07303, arXiv:2308.07919 and arXiv:2308.07920, one knows that in the super-critical regime, i.e. when $u &lt; u_\ast$, there is a cluster of positive density inside any ball of radius $R$ with probability stretched exponentially close to $1$ in $R$. Furthermore, with similar probability, any two large clusters are connected to each other locally in any configuration with strictly smaller intensity. This last property falls short of the classical local uniqueness, which requires a connection in the same configuration, i.e. in absence of any sprinkling. In this article we resolve this question by proving a stronger property, namely that local uniqueness holds simultaneously for all configurations $\mathcal{V}^{v}$ with $v \le u$. Apart from the severe degeneracies in the conditional law of $\mathcal{V}^u$ including the lack of any finite-energy property, our methods also face up to the well-known problem of decoupling non-monotone events, by exhibiting a certain regularity in terms of so-called excursion packets, which has implications beyond the scope of this paper. Our approach suggests a robust way to tackle similar problems for various other (correlated) models. In itself, the strong local uniqueness we prove yields several important results characterizing the super-critical phase of $\mathcal{V}^u$, among which are the large-scale geometry of the infinite cluster and sharp upper bounds on truncated connectivity functions.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Gaussian Random Fields for Multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Coupling Stochastic Partial Differential Equation and The Karhunen-Lo\`eve Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces structure preserving hierarchical decompositions for sampling Gaussian random fields (GRF) within the context of multilevel Bayesian inference in high-dimensional space. Existing scalable hierarchical sampling methods, such as those based on stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), often reduce the dimensionality of the sample space at the cost of accuracy of inference. Other approaches, such that those based on Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansions, offer sample space dimensionality reduction but sacrifice GRF representation accuracy and ergodicity of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, and are computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems. The proposed method integrates the dimensionality reduction capabilities of KL expansions with the scalability of stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)-based sampling, thereby providing a robust, unified framework for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ) that is scalable, accurate, preserves ergodicity, and offers dimensionality reduction of the sample space. The hierarchy in our multilevel algorithm is derived from the geometric multigrid hierarchy. By constructing a hierarchical decomposition that maintains the covariance structure across the levels in the hierarchy, the approach enables efficient coarse-to-fine sampling while ensuring that all samples are drawn from the desired distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a benchmark subsurface flow problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. Our proposed technique is more efficient, accurate, and displays better convergence properties than existing methods for high-dimensional Bayesian inference problems.</description>

      <title>On weak notions of no-arbitrage in a 1D general diffusion market with interest rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish deterministic necessary and sufficient conditions for the no-arbitrage notions "no increasing profit" (NIP), "no strong arbitrage" (NSA) and "no unbounded profit with bounded risk" (NUPBR) in one-dimensional general diffusion markets. These are markets with one risky asset, which is modeled as a regular continuous strong Markov process that is also a semimartingale, and a riskless asset that grows exponentially at a constant rate $r\in \mathbb{R}$. All deterministic criteria are provided in terms of the scale function and the speed measure of the risky asset process. Our study reveals a variety of surprising effects. For instance, irrespective of the interest rate, NIP is not excluded by reflecting boundaries or an irregular scale function. In the case of non-zero interest rates, it is even possible that NUPBR holds in the presence of reflecting boundaries and/or skew thresholds. In the zero interest rate regime, we also identify NSA as the minimal no arbitrage notion that excludes reflecting boundaries and that forces the scale function to be continuously differentiable with strictly positive absolutely continuous derivative, meaning that it is of the same form as for a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Khinchin Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Khinchin families connects Probability Theory and Complex Analysis. Along this PhD thesis, we exploit this connection to obtain, using a variety of local central limit theorems, asymptotic formulas for the coefficients of analytic functions with non-negative coefficients. We give criteria for a power series to have certain specific, and in most cases, computable, asymptotic formula.
  The theory of Khinchin families was initiated and is strongly influenced by the work of Walter K. Hayman, Paul C. Rosembloom, and Luis B\'aez-Duarte. We can assign to each power series $f$ in the class $\mathcal{K}$, having radius of convergence $R&gt;0$, a family of random variables $(X_t)_{[0,R)}$. This theory examines the behavior of this family of random variables, and also of its normalized version, as $t \uparrow R$.
  This thesis aims to harmonize the various asymptotic formulas for combinatorial or probabilistic objects within a single framework. With this aim we have extended some of the classes of functions and also studied the coefficients of large powers of analytic functions. One of our main goals was to consolidate and develop some aspects of a comprehensive theory: providing a guidebook for combinatorialists or probabilists, a series of results, or basic criteria, where they can follow a step-by-step process, verify if certain straightforward conditions are met, and then derive an asymptotic formula for the object of study. However, this is not the sole primary goal; we are also profoundly interested in the functional theoretical properties of these classes of functions and their connections to the respective Khinchin families (such as the case of $f \in \mathcal{K}$ being an entire function).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate periodic points of the Dyck shift from the viewpoint of large deviations. We establish the level-2 Large Deviation Principle with the rate function given in terms of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies of shift-invariant Borel probability measures. Unlike topologically mixing Markov shifts, the level-2 rate function is non-convex and level-1 rate functions are superpositions of two convex continuous functions. Using the thermodynamic formalism, we show the analyticity of level-1 rate functions in some relevant cases. We display a non-convex level-1 rate function with a non-differentiable point in the interior of its effective domain.</description>

      <title>Controllability concepts for mean-field dynamics with reduced-rank coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore several novel notions of exact controllability for mean-field linear controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A key feature of our study is that the noise coefficient is not required to be of full rank. We begin by demonstrating that classical exact controllability with $\mathbb{L}^2$-controls necessarily requires both rank conditions on the noise introduced in [8] and subsequent works. When these rank conditions are not satisfied, we introduce alternative rank requirements on the drift, which enable exact controllability by relaxing the regularity of the controls. In cases where both the aforementioned rank conditions fail, we propose and characterize a new notion of exact terminal controllability to normal laws (ETCNL). Additionally, we investigate a new class of Wasserstein-set-valued backward SDEs that arise naturally associated to ETCNL.</description>

      <title>The law of the circumference of sparse binomial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been much interest in the distribution of the circumference, the length of the longest cycle, of a random graph $G(n,p)$ in the sparse regime, when $p = \Theta\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)$. Recently, the first author and Frieze established a scaling limit for the circumference in this regime, along the way establishing an alternative 'structural' approximation for this parameter. In this paper, we give a central limit theorem for the circumference in this regime using a novel argument based on the Efron-Stein inequality, which relies on a combinatorial analysis of the effect of resampling edges on this approximation.</description>

      <title>Quantization for a condensation system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given $r \in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, represents the rate at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exist, we define $\underline{D}_r(\mu)$ and $\overline{D}_r(\mu)$ as the lower and the upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of the condensation measure $\mu$ associated with a condensation system $(\{S_j\}_{j=1}^N, (p_j)_{j=0}^N, \nu).$ We provide two examples: one where $\nu$ is an infinite discrete distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, and one where $\nu$ is a uniform distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. For both the discrete and uniform distributions $\nu$, we determine the optimal sets of $n$-means, and calculate the quantization dimensions of condensation measures $\mu$, and show that the $D_r(\mu)$-dimensional quantization coefficients do not exist. Moreover, we demonstrate that the lower and upper quantization coefficients are finite and positive.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a chemical reaction process, modeled as a multi-dimensional continuous-time jump process. Assume that at given times $0&lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt;t_n$, linear combinations $v_i = L_i X(t_i),\, i=1,\dots ,n$ are observed for given matrices $L_i$. We show how the process that is conditioned on hitting the states $v_1,\dots, v_n$ is obtained by a change of measure on the law of the unconditioned process. This results in an algorithm for obtaining weighted samples from the conditioned process. Our results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Graph Conditioned on Every Component Being a Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an application in community detection, we consider an \ER random graph conditioned on the rare event that all connected components are fully connected. Such graphs can be considered as partitions of vertices into cliques. Hence, this conditional distribution defines a distribution over partitions. We show that a popular community detection method is equivalent to Bayesian inference with this distribution as prior over the community partitions. Using tools from analytic combinatorics, we prove limit theorems for several graph observables in this conditional distribution: the number of cliques; the number of edges; and the degree distribution. We consider several regimes of the connection probability $p$ as the number of vertices $n$ diverges. For $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$, the conditioning yields the uniform distribution over set partitions, which is well-studied, but has not been studied as a graph distribution before. For $p&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, we show that the number of cliques is of the order $n/\sqrt{\log n}$, while for $p&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, we prove that the graph consists of a single clique with high probability. This shows that there is a phase transition at $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$. We additionally study the near-critical regime $p_n\downarrow\tfrac{1}{2}$, as well as the sparse regime $p_n\downarrow0$. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for community detection.</description>

      <title>The critical density of the Stochastic Sandpile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic sandpile model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and demonstrate that the critical density is strictly less than one in all dimensions. This generalizes a previous result by Hoffman, Hu, Richey, and Rizzolo (2022), which was limited to the one-dimensional case. In addition, we show that the critical density is strictly positive on any vertex-transitive graph, extending the earlier result of Sidoravicius and Teixeira (2018) and providing a simpler proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a case study of probabilistic approach to homological aspects of topological quantum field theory via the example of topological quantum mechanics. We propose topological correlations in terms of large variance limit. An investigation on the relation between probabilistic topological correlations on the circle and Hochschild homology is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and universal finite-size scaling for the hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions 4 and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse and clarify the finite-size scaling of the weakly-coupled hierarchical $n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ model for all integers $n \ge 1$ in all dimensions $d\ge 4$, for both free and periodic boundary conditions. For $d&gt;4$, we prove that for a volume of size $R^{d}$ with periodic boundary conditions the infinite-volume critical point is an effective finite-volume critical point, whereas for free boundary conditions the effective critical point is shifted smaller by an amount of order $R^{-2}$. For both boundary conditions, the average field has the same non-Gaussian limit within a critical window of width $R^{-d/2}$ around the effective critical point, and in that window we compute the universal scaling profile for the susceptibility. In contrast, and again for both boundary conditions, the average field has a massive Gaussian limit when above the effective critical point by an amount $R^{-2}$. In particular, at the infinite-volume critical point the susceptibility scales as $R^{d/2}$ for periodic boundary conditions and as $R^{2}$ for free boundary conditions. We identify a mass generation mechanism for free boundary conditions that is responsible for this distinction and which we believe has wider validity, in particular to Euclidean (non-hierarchical) models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 4$. For $d=4$ we prove a similar picture with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis is based on the rigorous renormalisation group method of Bauerschmidt, Brydges and Slade, which we improve and extend.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called WingIt, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on WingIt and the plug-in estimator for $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems.</description>
