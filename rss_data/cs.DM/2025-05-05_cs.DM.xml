      <title>Net Occurrences in Fibonacci and Thue-Morse Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A net occurrence of a repeated string in a text is an occurrence with unique left and right extensions, and the net frequency of the string is the number of its net occurrences in the text. Originally introduced for applications in Natural Language Processing, net frequency has recently gained attention for its algorithmic aspects. Guo et al. [CPM 2024] and Ohlebusch et al. [SPIRE 2024] focus on its computation in the offline setting, while Guo et al. [SPIRE 2024], Inenaga [arXiv 2024], and Mieno and Inenaga [CPM 2025] tackle the online counterpart. Mieno and Inenaga also characterize net occurrences in terms of the minimal unique substrings of the text. Additionally, Guo et al. [CPM 2024] initiate the study of net occurrences in Fibonacci words to establish a lower bound on the asymptotic running time of algorithms. Although there has been notable progress in algorithmic developments and some initial combinatorial insights, the combinatorial aspects of net occurrences have yet to be thoroughly examined. In this work, we make two key contributions. First, we confirm the conjecture that each Fibonacci word contains exactly three net occurrences. Second, we show that each Thue-Morse word contains exactly nine net occurrences. To achieve these results, we introduce the notion of overlapping net occurrence cover, which narrows down the candidate net occurrences in any text. Furthermore, we provide a precise characterization of occurrences of Fibonacci and Thue-Morse words of smaller order, offering structural insights that may have independent interest and potential applications in algorithm analysis and combinatorial properties of these words.</description>

      <title>More efficient sifting for grid norms, and applications to multiparty communication complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the techniques behind the recent progress on the 3-term arithmetic progression problem [KM'23], Kelley, Lovett, and Meka [KLM'24] constructed the first explicit 3-player function $f:[N]^3 \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that demonstrates a strong separation between randomized and (non-)deterministic NOF communication complexity. Specifically, their hard function can be solved by a randomized protocol sending $O(1)$ bits, but requires $\Omega(\log^{1/3}(N))$ bits of communication with a deterministic (or non-deterministic) protocol.
  We show a stronger $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(N))$ lower bound for their construction. To achieve this, the key technical advancement is an improvement to the sifting argument for grid norms of (somewhat dense) bipartite graphs. In addition to quantitative improvement, we qualitatively improve over [KLM'24] by relaxing the hardness condition: while [KLM'24] proved their lower bound for any function $f$ that satisfies a strong two-sided pseudorandom condition, we show that a weak one-sided condition suffices. This is achieved by a new structural result for cylinder intersections (or, in graph-theoretic language, the set of triangles induced from a tripartite graph), showing that any small cylinder intersection can be efficiently covered by a sum of simple ``slice'' functions.</description>

      <title>Linear colorings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by algorithmic applications, Kun, O'Brien, Pilipczuk, and Sullivan introduced the parameter linear chromatic number as a relaxation of treedepth and proved that the two parameters are polynomially related. They conjectured that treedepth could be bounded from above by twice the linear chromatic number.
  In this paper we investigate the properties of linear chromatic number and provide improved bounds in several graph classes.</description>

      <title>i-QLS: Quantum-supported Algorithm for Least Squares Optimization in Non-Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an iterative quantum-assisted least squares (i-QLS) optimization method that leverages quantum annealing to overcome the scalability and precision limitations of prior quantum least squares approaches. Unlike traditional QUBO-based formulations, which suffer from a qubit overhead due to fixed discretization, our approach refines the solution space iteratively, enabling exponential convergence while maintaining a constant qubit requirement per iteration. This iterative refinement transforms the problem into an anytime algorithm, allowing for flexible computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we extend our framework beyond linear regression to non-linear function approximation via spline-based modeling, demonstrating its adaptability to complex regression tasks. We empirically validate i-QLS on the D-Wave quantum annealer, showing that our method efficiently scales to high-dimensional problems, achieving competitive accuracy with classical solvers while outperforming prior quantum approaches. Experiments confirm that i-QLS enables near-term quantum hardware to perform regression tasks with improved precision and scalability, paving the way for practical quantum-assisted machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: towards homology theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology (more precisely, of homology theory) in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>

      <title>Approximately Dominating Sets in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condorcet's paradox is a fundamental result in social choice theory which states that there exist elections in which, no matter which candidate wins, a majority of voters prefer a different candidate. In fact, even if we can select any $k$ winners, there still may exist another candidate that would beat each of the winners in a majority vote. That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets.
  We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.
  Our proof uses a simple probabilistic construction using samples from a maximal lottery, a well-studied distribution over candidates derived from the Nash equilibrium of a two-player game. In stark contrast to general approximate equilibria, which may require support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies, we show that maximal lotteries can be approximated with constant support size. These approximate maximal lotteries may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decomposition of Forman-Ricci Curvature on Vietoris-Rips Complexes and Data Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) is an efficient tool that characterizes essential geometrical features and associated transitions of real-world networks, extending seamlessly to higher-dimensional computations in simplicial complexes. In this article, we provide two major advancements: First, we give a decomposition for FRC, enabling local computations of FRC. Second, we construct a set-theoretical proof enabling an efficient algorithm for the local computation of FRC in Vietoris-Rips (VR) complexes.Strikingly, this approach reveals critical information and geometric insights often overlooked by conventional classification techniques. Our findings open new avenues for geometric computations in VR complexes and highlight an essential yet under-explored aspect of data classification: the geometry underpinning statistical patterns.</description>
