      <title>Promoting Prelaminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by problems in the study of Anosov and pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds, we characterize when a pair $(L^+, L^-)$ of subsets of transverse laminations of the circle can be completed to a pair of transverse foliations of the plane or, separately, realized as the endpoints of such a bifoliation of the plane. (We allow also singular bifoliations with simple prongs, such as arise in pseudo-Anosov flows). This program is carried out at a level of generality applicable to bifoliations coming from pseudo-Anosov flows with and without perfect fits, as well as many other examples, and is natural with respect to group actions preserving these structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new criterion which guarantees that a free group admits a bi-ordering that is invariant under a given automorphism. As an application, we show that the fundamental group of the "magic manifold" is bi-orderable, answering a question of Kin and Rolfsen.</description>

      <title>Simple homotopy invariance of the loop coproduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a transformation formula for the Goresky-Hingston loop coproduct in string topology under homotopy equivalences of manifolds. The formula involves the trace of the Whitehead torsion of the homotopy equivalence. In particular, it implies that the loop coproduct is invariant under simple homotopy equivalences. In a sense, our results determine the Dennis trace of the simple homotopy type of a closed manifold from its framed configuration spaces of $\leq 2$ points. We also explain how the loop coproduct arises as a secondary operation in a 2-dimensional TQFT which elucidates a topological origin of the transformation formula.</description>

      <title>Uniform exponential mixing for congruence covers of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense convex cocompact subgroup contained in an arithmetic lattice of $\operatorname{SO}(n, 1)^{\circ}$. We prove uniform exponential mixing of the geodesic flow for congruence covers of the hyperbolic manifold $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^n$ avoiding finitely many prime ideals. This extends the work of Oh-Winter who proved the result for the $n = 2$ case. Following their approach, we use Dolgopyat's method for the proof of exponential mixing of the geodesic flow. We do this uniformly over congruence covers by establishing uniform spectral bounds for the congruence transfer operators associated to the geodesic flow. This requires another key ingredient which is the expander machinery due to Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak extended by Golsefidy-Varj\'{u}.</description>

      <title>One-relator hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that one-relator groups with negative immersions are hyperbolic and virtually special; this resolves a recent conjecture of Louder and Wilton. As a consequence, one-relator groups with negative immersions are residually finite, linear and have isomorphism problem decidable among one-relator groups. Using the fact that parafree one-relator groups have negative immersions, we answer a question of Baumslag's from 1986. The main new tool we develop is a refinement of the classic Magnus--Moldavanskii hierarchy for one-relator groups. We introduce the notions of Z-stable HNN-extensions and Z-stable hierarchies. We then show that a one-relator group is hyperbolic and has a quasi-convex one-relator hierarchy if and only if it does not contain a Baumslag--Solitar subgroup and has a Z-stable one-relator hierarchy.</description>

      <title>On a Bers theorem for SL(3,C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $S$ a closed surface of genus at least $2$, let $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)$ be the Hitchin component of representations to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R}),$ equipped with the Labourie-Loftin complex structure. We construct a mapping class group equivariant holomorphic map from a large open subset of $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$ to the $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-character variety that restricts to the identity on the diagonal and to Bers' simultaneous uniformization on $\mathcal{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathcal{T}(S)}$. The open subset contains $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathcal{T}(S)}$ and $\mathcal{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$, and the image includes the holonomies of $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-opers.
  The map is realized by associating pairs of Hitchin representations to immersions into $\mathbb{C}^3$ that we call complex affine spheres, which are equivalent to certain conformal harmonic maps into $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{C})$ and to new objects called bi-Higgs bundles. Complex affine spheres are obtained by solving a second-order complex elliptic PDE that resembles both the Beltrami and Tzitz\'eica equations. To study this equation we establish analytic results that should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Porosity and topological properties of triply periodic minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have garnered significant interest due to their structural efficiency and controllable geometry, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper investigates the relationships between porosity and persistence entropy with the shape factor of TPMS. We propose conjectures suggesting that these relationships are polynomial in nature, derived through the application of machine learning techniques. This study exemplifies the integration of machine learning methodologies in pure mathematical research. Besides the conjectures, we provide the mathematical models that might have the potential implications for the design and modeling of TPMS structures in various practical applications.</description>
