      <title>Infection fronts in randomly varying transmission-rate media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the geometry and transport properties of infection fronts within the spatial SIR model in two dimensions. The model incorporates short-range correlated quenched random transmission rates. Our findings reveal that the critical average transmission rate for the steady-state propagation of the infection is overestimated by the naive mean-field homogenization. Furthermore, we observe that the velocity, profile, and harmfulness of the fronts, given a specific average transmission, are sensitive to the details of randomness. In particular, we find that the harmfulness of the front is larger the more uniform the transmission-rate is, suggesting potential optimization in vaccination strategies under constraints like fixed average-transmission-rates or limited vaccine resources. The large-scale geometry of the advancing fronts presents nevertheless robust universal features and, for a statistically isotropic and short-range correlated disorder, we get a roughness exponent $\alpha\approx 0.42 \pm 0.10$ and a dynamical exponent $z\approx 1.6 \pm 0.10$, which are roughly compatible with the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We find that the KPZ term and the disorder-induced effective noise are present and have a kinematic origin.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamical models from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of biological systems, from proteins to cells to organisms, is complex and stochastic. To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to higher-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend evaluating the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging inside scattering media through virtual spatiotemporal wavefront shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiple scattering of light makes materials opaque and obstructs imaging. Wavefront shaping can reverse the scattering process, but imaging with physical wavefront shaping has limitations such as requiring physical guidestars, being restricted within a small isoplanatic volume, and relying on slow wavefront updates, with some approaches only working for planar targets outside the scattering media. Here, we introduce scattering matrix tomography (SMT): measure the hyperspectral scattering matrix of the sample, use it to digitally scan a synthesized confocal spatiotemporal focus and construct a volumetric image of the sample, and then use the tomograms as virtual guidestars in a nonconvex optimization to find the pulse shape, input wavefront, and output wavefront that can compensate for aberrations and scattering. SMT combines the strengths of wavefront shaping, spatiotemporal gating, and computational adaptive optics, eliminating physical guidestars and enabling digital double-path wavefront corrections tailored for every isoplanatic volume. We demonstrate sub-micron lateral resolution and one-micron axial resolution at one millimeter beneath ex vivo mouse brain tissue and over three transport mean free paths inside an opaque colloid, where existing imaging methods all fail due to the overwhelming multiple scattering. As a noninvasive and label-free method that works both inside and outside the scattering media, SMT may be applied broadly across medical imaging, biological science, device inspection, and colloidal physics.</description>

      <title>Dreaming of Electrical Waves: Generative Modeling of Cardiac Excitation Waves using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical waves in the heart form rotating spiral or scroll waves during life-threatening arrhythmias such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation. The wave dynamics are typically modeled using coupled partial differential equations, which describe reaction-diffusion dynamics in excitable media. More recently, data-driven generative modeling has emerged as an alternative to generate spatio-temporal patterns in physical and biological systems. Here, we explore denoising diffusion probabilistic models for the generative modeling of electrical wave patterns in cardiac tissue. We trained diffusion models with simulated electrical wave patterns to be able to generate such wave patterns in unconditional and conditional generation tasks. For instance, we explored the diffusion-based i) parameter-specific generation, ii) evolution and iii) inpainting of spiral wave dynamics, including reconstructing three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics from superficial two-dimensional measurements. Further, we generated arbitrarily shaped bi-ventricular geometries and simultaneously initiated scroll wave patterns inside these geometries using diffusion. We characterized and compared the diffusion-generated solutions to solutions obtained with corresponding biophysical models and found that diffusion models learn to replicate spiral and scroll waves dynamics so well that they could be used for data-driven modeling of excitation waves in cardiac tissue. For instance, an ensemble of diffusion-generated spiral wave dynamics exhibits similar self-termination statistics as the corresponding ensemble simulated with a biophysical model. However, we also found that diffusion models {produce artifacts if training data is lacking, e.g. during self-termination,} and `hallucinate' wave patterns when insufficiently constrained.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>
