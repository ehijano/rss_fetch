      <title>Portfolio optimisation: bridging the gap between theory and practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimisation is widely acknowledged for its significance in investment decision-making. Yet, existing methodologies face several limitations, among them converting optimal theoretical portfolios into real investment is not always straightforward. Several classes of exogenous (real-world) constraints have been proposed in literature with the intent of reducing the gap between theory and practice, which have worked to an extent.
  In this paper, we propose an optimisation-based framework which attempts to further reduce this gap. We have the explicit intention of producing portfolios that can be immediately converted into financial holdings. Our proposed framework is generic in the sense that it can be used in conjunction with any portfolio selection model, and consists of splitting the portfolio selection problem into two-stages. The main motivation behind this approach is in enabling automated investing with minimal human intervention, and thus the framework was built in such a way that real-world market features can be incorporated with relative ease. Among the novel contributions of this paper, this is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, to combine futures contracts and equities in a single framework, and also the first to consider borrowing costs in short positions.
  We present extensive computational results to illustrate the applicability of our approach and to evaluate its overall quality. Among these experiments, we observed that alternatives from literature are susceptible to numerical errors, whereas our approach effectively mitigates this issue.</description>

      <title>Vector-valued robust stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dynamic stochastic control problem subject to Knightian uncertainty with multi-objective (vector-valued) criteria. Assuming the preferences across expected multi-loss vectors are represented by a given, yet general, preorder, we address the model uncertainty by adopting a robust or minimax perspective, minimizing expected loss across the worst-case model. For loss functions taking real (or scalar) values, there is no ambiguity in interpreting supremum and infimum. In contrast to the scalar case, major challenges for multi-loss control problems include properly defining and interpreting the notions of supremum and infimum, and addressing the non-uniqueness of these suprema and infima. To deal with these, we employ the notion of an ideal point vector-valued supremum for the robust part of the problem, while we view the control part as a multi-objective (or vector) optimization problem. Using a set-valued framework, we derive both a weak and strong version of the dynamic programming principle (DPP) or Bellman equations by taking the value function as the collection of all worst expected losses across all feasible actions. The weak version of Bellman's principle is proved under minimal assumptions. To establish a stronger version of DPP, we introduce the rectangularity property with respect to a general preorder. We also further study a particular, but important, case of component-wise partial order of vectors, for which we additionally derive DPP under a different set-valued notion for the value function, the so-called upper image of the multi-objective problem. Finally, we provide illustrative examples motivated by financial problems.
  These results will serve as a foundation for addressing time-inconsistent problems subject to model uncertainty through the lens of a set-valued framework, as well as for studying multi-portfolio allocation problems under model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Portfolio of Assets with Extreme Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model a portfolio of crypto assets that does not respond well to multivariate autoregressive models because of discontinuity in conditional covariance matrix and posterior covariance matrix caused by extreme liquidity. We adjust asset-level return and volatility with liquidity to reduce such discontinuity, and restore the effectiveness of a set of liquidity-adjusted VECM-DCC/ADCC-BL models at extreme liquidity. We establish two distinctive yet complementary portfolio liquidity measures: portfolio liquidity jump that quantifies the effect of liquidity adjustment in forecasting the conditional covariance matrix, and portfolio liquidity diffusion that quantifies the effect of liquidity adjustment in estimating the posterior covariance matrix.</description>
