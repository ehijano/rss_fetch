      <title>An Approach to Optimizing the VABA Protocol Using $\kappa$-size Committee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byzantine agreement protocols in asynchronous networks have gained renewed attention due to their independence from network timing assumptions to ensure termination. Traditional asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols require every party to broadcast its requests (e.g., transactions), leading to high communication costs as parties ultimately agree on one party's request. This inefficiency is particularly significant in multi-valued Byzantine agreement protocols, where parties aim to agree on one party's requests under the assumption $n=3f+1$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, and $f$ is the number of Byzantine parties.
  To address these inefficiencies, we propose Efficient-VABA (eVABA), an optimized protocol for the asynchronous Byzantine agreement (ABA) problem. By limiting broadcasts to a selected subset of parties, the protocol reduces the number of messages and computation overhead.</description>

      <title>BatchLLM: Optimizing Large Batched LLM Inference with Global Prefix Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.</description>

      <title>Securing RC Based P2P Networks: A Blockchain-based Access Control Framework utilizing Ethereum Smart Contracts for IoT and Web 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring security for highly dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has always been a challenge, especially for services like online transactions and smart devices. These networks experience high churn rates, making it difficult to maintain appropriate access control. Traditional systems, particularly Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), often fail to meet the needs of a P2P environment. This paper presents a blockchain-based access control framework that uses Ethereum smart contracts to address these challenges. Our framework aims to close the gaps in existing access control systems by providing flexible, transparent, and decentralized security solutions. The proposed framework includes access control contracts (ACC) that manage access based on static and dynamic policies, a Judge Contract (JC) to handle misbehavior, and a Register Contract (RC) to record and manage the interactions between ACCs and JC. The security model combines impact and severity-based threat assessments using the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and STRIDE principles, ensuring responses are tailored to different threat levels. This system not only stabilizes the fundamental issues of peer membership but also offers a scalable solution, particularly valuable in areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web 3.0 technologies.</description>

      <title>BEFL: Balancing Energy Consumption in Federated Learning for Mobile Edge IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm designed to build a highly accurate global model. In Mobile Edge IoT (MEIoT), the training and communication processes can significantly deplete the limited battery resources of devices. Existing research primarily focuses on reducing overall energy consumption, but this may inadvertently create energy consumption imbalances, leading to the premature dropout of energy-sensitive devices.To address these challenges, we propose BEFL, a joint optimization framework aimed at balancing three objectives: enhancing global model accuracy, minimizing total energy consumption, and reducing energy usage disparities among devices. First, taking into account the communication constraints of MEIoT and the heterogeneity of devices, we employed the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm for the rational allocation of communication resources. Based on this, we introduce a heuristic client selection algorithm that combines cluster partitioning with utility-driven approaches to alleviate both the total energy consumption of all devices and the discrepancies in energy usage.Furthermore, we utilize the proposed heuristic client selection algorithm as a template for offline imitation learning during pre-training, while adopting a ranking-based reinforcement learning approach online to further boost training efficiency. Our experiments reveal that BEFL improves global model accuracy by 1.6\%, reduces energy consumption variance by 72.7\%, and lowers total energy consumption by 28.2\% compared to existing methods.

      <title>Quality Control in Open-Ended Crowdsourcing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crowdsourcing provides a flexible approach for leveraging human intelligence to solve large-scale problems, gaining widespread acceptance in domains like intelligent information processing, social decision-making, and crowd ideation. However, the uncertainty of participants significantly compromises the answer quality, sparking substantial research interest. Existing surveys predominantly concentrate on quality control in Boolean tasks, which are generally formulated as simple label classification, ranking, or numerical prediction. Ubiquitous open-ended tasks like question-answering, translation, and semantic segmentation have not been sufficiently discussed. These tasks usually have large to infinite answer spaces and non-unique acceptable answers, posing significant challenges for quality assurance. This survey focuses on quality control methods applicable to open-ended tasks in crowdsourcing. We propose a two-tiered framework to categorize related works. The first tier introduces a holistic view of the quality model, encompassing key aspects like task, worker, answer, and system. The second tier refines the classification into more detailed categories, including quality dimensions, evaluation metrics, and design decisions, providing insights into the internal structures of the quality control framework in each aspect. We thoroughly investigate how these quality control methods are implemented in state-of-the-art works and discuss key challenges and potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>MultiTASC++: A Continuously Adaptive Scheduler for Edge-Based Multi-Device Cascade Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cascade systems, consisting of a lightweight model processing all samples and a heavier, high-accuracy model refining challenging samples, have become a widely-adopted distributed inference approach to achieving high accuracy and maintaining a low computational burden for mobile and IoT devices. As intelligent indoor environments, like smart homes, continue to expand, a new scenario emerges, the multi-device cascade. In this setting, multiple diverse devices simultaneously utilize a shared heavy model hosted on a server, often situated within or close to the consumer environment. This work introduces MultiTASC++, a continuously adaptive multi-tenancy-aware scheduler that dynamically controls the forwarding decision functions of devices to optimize system throughput while maintaining high accuracy and low latency. Through extensive experimentation in diverse device environments and with varying server-side models, we demonstrate the scheduler's efficacy in consistently maintaining a targeted satisfaction rate while providing the highest available accuracy across different device tiers and workloads of up to 100 devices. This demonstrates its scalability and efficiency in addressing the unique challenges of collaborative DNN inference in dynamic and diverse IoT environments.</description>

      <title>Federated Automated Feature Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) is used to automatically create new features from original features to improve predictive performance without needing significant human intervention and expertise. Many algorithms exist for AutoFE, but very few approaches exist for the federated learning (FL) setting where data is gathered across many clients and is not shared between clients or a central server. We introduce AutoFE algorithms for the horizontal, vertical, and hybrid FL settings, which differ in how the data is gathered across clients. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop AutoFE algorithms for the horizontal and hybrid FL cases, and we show that the downstream model performance of federated AutoFE is similar to the case where data is held centrally and AutoFE is performed centrally.</description>

      <title>FedDUAL: A Dual-Strategy with Adaptive Loss and Dynamic Aggregation for Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) marks a transformative approach to distributed model training by combining locally optimized models from various clients into a unified global model. While FL preserves data privacy by eliminating centralized storage, it encounters significant challenges such as performance degradation, slower convergence, and reduced robustness of the global model due to the heterogeneity in client data distributions. Among the various forms of data heterogeneity, label skew emerges as a particularly formidable and prevalent issue, especially in domains such as image classification. To address these challenges, we begin with comprehensive experiments to pinpoint the underlying issues in the FL training process. Based on our findings, we then introduce an innovative dual-strategy approach designed to effectively resolve these issues. First, we introduce an adaptive loss function for client-side training, meticulously crafted to preserve previously acquired knowledge while maintaining an optimal equilibrium between local optimization and global model coherence. Secondly, we develop a dynamic aggregation strategy for aggregating client models at the server. This approach adapts to each client's unique learning patterns, effectively addressing the challenges of diverse data across the network. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across three diverse real-world datasets, coupled with theoretical convergence guarantees, demonstrates the superior efficacy of our method compared to several established state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Personalization in FedProx: A Fine-grained Analysis on Statistical Accuracy and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FedProx is a simple yet effective federated learning method that enables model personalization via regularization. Despite remarkable success in practice, a rigorous analysis of how such a regularization provably improves the statistical accuracy of each client's local model hasn't been fully established. Setting the regularization strength heuristically presents a risk, as an inappropriate choice may even degrade accuracy. This work fills in the gap by analyzing the effect of regularization on statistical accuracy, thereby providing a theoretical guideline for setting the regularization strength for achieving personalization. We prove that by adaptively choosing the regularization strength under different statistical heterogeneity, FedProx can consistently outperform pure local training and achieve a \textit{minimax-optimal} statistical rate. In addition, to shed light on resource allocation, we design an algorithm, provably showing that stronger personalization reduces communication complexity without increasing the computation cost overhead. Finally, our theory is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and its generalizability is verified in a non-convex setting.</description>
