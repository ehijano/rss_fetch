      <title>Fractal dimensions and profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a finitely branching rooted tree such that any node has at least two successors. The path space $[T]$ is an ultrametric space where the distance of distinct paths $f,g$ is $1/|T_n|$, with $T_n$ denoting the set of nodes at distance $n$ from the root. Let $S$ be a subtree of $T$ without leaves that is level-wise uniformly branching, in the sense that the number of successors of a node only depends on its distance from the root. We show that the Hausdorff and lower box dimensions coincide for~$[S]$, and the packing and upper box dimensions also coincide. We give geometric proofs, as well as proofs based on the point to set principles. We use the first result to reprove a result of Barnea and Shalev on the dimension of closed subgroups of a profinite group $G$, referring only on the geometric structure of the closed subgroup in the canonical path space given by an inverse system for $G$.</description>

      <title>Profinite Rigidity over Noetherian Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of profinite rigidity for modules over a Noetherian domain: to what extent are these objects determined by their finite images? We establish foundational statements in analogy to classical results in the category of groups. We describe three profinite invariants of modules over any Noetherian domain $\Lambda$. Most notably, we show that being projective is a profinite invariant of $\Lambda$-modules. We demonstrate absolute profinite rigidity for free modules assuming that $\Lambda$ satisfies a homological condition, and for all modules when $\Lambda$ is a PID. As an application, we prove that torsion-free lamplighter groups and solvable Baumslag--Solitar groups are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense. The latter class includes the first known examples of non-abelian one-relator groups and non-LERF groups which are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometry classification of certain graph $2$-braid groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Oh22}, the second author defined a complex of groups decomposition of the fundamental group of a finitely generated 2-dimensional special group, called an \emph{intersection complex}, which is a quasi-isometry invariant. In this paper, using the theory of intersection complexes, we classify the class of 2-braid groups over graphs with circumference $\leq 1$ up to quasi-isometry. Moreover, we find a sufficient condition when such a graph 2-braid group is quasi-isometric to a right-angled Artin group or not. Finally, by applying the same method, we also find that there is an algorithm to determine whether two 4-braid groups over trees are quasi-isometric or not.</description>

      <title>Membership and Conjugacy in Inverse Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The membership problem for an algebraic structure asks whether a given element is contained in some substructure, which is usually given by generators. In this work we study the membership problem, as well as the conjugacy problem, for finite inverse semigroups. The closely related membership problem for finite semigroups has been shown to be PSPACE-complete in the transformation model by Kozen (1977) and NL-complete in the Cayley table model by Jones, Lien, and Laaser (1976). More recently, both the membership and the conjugacy problem for finite inverse semigroups were shown to be PSPACE-complete in the partial bijection model by Jack (2023).
  Here we present a more detailed analysis of the complexity of the membership and conjugacy problems parametrized by varieties of finite inverse semigroups. We establish dichotomy theorems for the partial bijection model and for the Cayley table model. In the partial bijection model these problems are in NC (resp. NP for conjugacy) for strict inverse semigroups and PSPACE-complete otherwise. In the Cayley table model we obtain general LOGSPACE-algorithms as well as NPOLYLOGTIME upper bounds for Clifford semigroups and LOGSPACE-completeness otherwise.
  Furthermore, by applying our findings, we show the following: the intersection non-emptiness problem for inverse automata is PSPACE-complete even for automata with only two states; the subpower membership problem is in NC for every strict inverse semi-group and PSPACE-complete otherwise; the minimum generating set and the equation satisfiability problems are in NP for varieties of finite strict inverse semigroups and PSPACE-complete otherwise.</description>

      <title>Intersection Hypergraph on D_n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $S$ be the set of all non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$. The intersection hypergraph of $G$, denoted by $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(G)$, is a hypergraph whose vertex set is $\{H \in S \,\, | \,\, H \cap K = \{e\} \,\, \text{for some} \, K \in S \}$ and hyperedges are the maximal subsets of the vertex set with the property that any two vertices in it have a trivial intersection. The aim of this paper is to study the intersection hypergraph of dihedral groups, $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. We examine some of the structural properties, viz., diameter, girth and chromatic number of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$. Also, we provide characterizations for hypertreees, star structures of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$, and investigate the planarity and non-planarity of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(D_n)$.</description>

      <title>Almost simple groups as flag-transitive automorphism groups of 2-designs with {\lambda} = 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study $2$-designs with $\lambda=2$ admitting a flag-transitive almost simple automorphism group with socle a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type, and we prove that such a $2$-design does not exist. In conclusion, we present a classification of $2$-designs with $\lambda=2$ admitting flag-transitive and point-primitive automorphism groups of almost simple type, which states that such a $2$-design belongs to an infinite family of $2$-designs with parameter set $((3^n-1)/2,3,2)$ and $X=PSL_n(3)$ for some $n\geq 3$, or it is isomorphic to the $2$-design with parameter set $(6,3,2)$, $(7,4,2)$, $(10,4,2)$, $(10,4,2)$, $(11,5,2)$, $(28,7,2)$, $(28,3,2)$, $(36,6,2)$, $(126,6,2)$ or $(176,8,2)$.</description>

      <title>Orbit problems for free-abelian times free groups and related families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Brinkmann Problems (BrP &amp; BrCP) and the twisted-conjugacy Problem (TCP) are decidable for any endomorphism of a free-abelian times free (FATF) group Fn x Z^m. Furthermore, we prove the decidability of the two-sided Brinkmann conjugacy problem (2BrCP) for monomorphisms of FATF groups (and combine it with TCP) to derive the decidability of the conjugacy problem for ascending HNN extensions of FATF groups.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter groups have infinite weak cop number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, a variation of the cop number, is an invariant suitable for infinite graphs and is a quasi-isometric invariant. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist locally finite infinite graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists locally finite vertex transitive graphs whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We test this question on Cayley graphs of wreath products, these are objects known for their exotic geometries. We prove that Cayley graphs of wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. The result is proved by defining a new pursuit and evasion game and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. We also include a short argument that Cayley graphs of Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak cop number.</description>

      <title>Cohomological characterisation of hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any geodesic metric space $X$, we give a complete cohomological characterisation of the hyperbolicity of $X$ in terms of vanishing of its second $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology. We extend this result to the relative setting of $X$ with a collection of uniformly hyperbolic subgraphs. As an application, we give a cohomological characterisation of acylindrical hyperbolicity.</description>
