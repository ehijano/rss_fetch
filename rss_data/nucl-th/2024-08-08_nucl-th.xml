      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that, separately, the new N$^2$LO NMEs can have up to a $15\%$ impact on the total NME, but cancellations lead to an overall N$^2$LO contribution centered around $-5\%$ for the shell model and $+10\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. In addition, our results support the $\chi$EFT prediction that the ultrasoft NME is closely related to contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <title>Effect of neutrino electromagnetic properties on the quasielastic neutral-current neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quasielastic region, we investigate the effect of neutrino electromagnetic properties constrained from the recent experiments on the electroweak neutral current reaction process of the neutrino-$^{12}$C scattering. For a relativistic description of the nuclear dynamics, we employ the relativistic mean-field model, which has been proven to describe the data nicely in the quasielastic region. In the present work, we analyze the influence beyond the Standard Model by considering the neutrino magnetic and electric dipole form factors and charge radius on the neutrino electroweak interactions within $^{12}$C. To this end, we use the values of the neutrino charge radius and the magnetic moment at the squared four momentum transfer $Q^2=0$ obtained from the recent experiments and calculate the neutrino differential cross section of the neutrino-$^{12}$C scattering. We find that the effect of the charge radius and the electric dipole form factor is very small, but the role of the magnetic dipole form factor is sensitive to $Q^2$ and becomes sizable at small momentum transfer.</description>

      <title>The Wood-Saxon proton optical potential for p-nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenological mass-energy dependent proton optical model potential has been computed for p-nuclei. The parameters of the Wood-Saxon optical potential are found to be a good fit for proton elastic scattering data involving p-nuclei and elements with mass numbers near p-nuclei (within the range of 74 &lt; A &lt; 148) at energies around the Coulomb barrier of the system. The elastic scattering data were meticulously fitted using the SFRESCO code, allowing for the calculation of the real and imaginary parts of the Wood Saxon optical potential. To validate the model, experimental proton capture cross-sections for 106Cd and 113In near the Coulomb barrier were compared with results obtained using the TALYS-1.96 code, showing better agreement than the available global proton optical model potential.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of dark matter admixed neutron star based on recent observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars is modeled using the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach with a mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction, a modified sigma cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut), and the influences of dark matter in the NL (NL DM). Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we evaluate the plausibility and impact of each scenario. Experimental constraints on the general properties of finite nuclei and heavy ion collisions, along with astrophysical observational data on neutron star radii and tidal deformation, have been taken into account. It was shown that all models, including the PREX-II data, were less favored, indicating that this experimental data seemed to be in tension with the other constraints included in the inference procedure, and were incompatible with chiral effective field theoretical calculations of pure neutron matter. Considering the models with no PREX-II constraints, we find the model NL-$\sigma$ cut with the largest Bayes evidence, indicating that the constraints considered favor the stiffening of the EOS at large densities. Conversely, the neutron star with a dark matter component is the least favorable case in light of recent observational constraints, among different scenarios considered here. The $f$ and $p$ modes were calculated within the Cowling approximation, and it can be seen that $f$ modes are sensitive to the EOS. An analysis of the slopes of the mass-radius curves and $f$-mode mass curves has indicated that these quantities may help distinguish the different scenarios.We also analyzed the impact of new PSR J0437-4715 measurements on neutron star mass-radius estimates, noting a $\sim$ 0.2 km reduction in the 90\% CI upper boundary across all models and a significant Bayes evidence decrease, indicating potential conflicts with previous data or the necessity for more adaptable models.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-quark mixed matter and neutron star EOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleon-quark mixed matter is defined in the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock framework, in which quark densities are determined by equilibrium conditions between nucleon and quark chemical potentials, and nucleon-quark interactions play critical roles for resulting EoSs (equation of state). The two models of EoSs are derived from the nucleon-quark mixed matter (NQMM): The NQMM-A EoSs are based on the simple assumption that nucleons and free quarks occupy their respective Fermi levels and their Fermi spheres overlap from each other. In NQMM-B EoSs, the quark Fermi repulsion effect is incorporated on the basis of quakyonic matter, meaning that the nucleon Fermi levels are pushed up from the quark Fermi sphere by the Pauli exclusion principle. For the NQMM-A EoSs, the neutron-star mass-radius ($MR$) curves are pushed up above the region of $M \sim 2.1M_\odot$ and $R_{2.1M_\odot}\sim$ 12.5 km indicated by the recent observations, as the $qN$ repulsions increase. For the NQMM-B EoSs, the similar results are obtained by the combined contributions from the $qN$ repulsion and the quark Fermi repulsion. In both models of EoSs, the important roles of the $qN$ di-quark exchange repulsions are demonstrated to reproduce reasonable values of $M_{max}$ and $R_{2.1M_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. When it is cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, which triggers a superfluid transition. Previous works on neutron superfluidity are focused on the finite-temperature transition. Little attention is paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of nuclear density $\rho$. The density serves as a non-thermal parameter for superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, there is a strong coupling between the gapless neutrons and the quantum critical fluctuations of superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling by using perturbation theory and renormalization group method, and show that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the Fermi-liquid specific heat $c_{n}\propto T$ and also markedly alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge at a time much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire life of a neutron star. At a low $T$, such phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior, yet occupying different layers. We include superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and find that it obviously prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a variety of neutron stars. Our results indicate the existence of an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Effective Theory for Partons in the Spirit of Steven Weinberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard formulation of parton physics involves light-cone correlations of quark and gluon fields in a hadron, which leads to a widespread impression that it can only be studied through real-time Hamiltonian dynamics or light-front quantization, which are challenged by non-perturbative computations with a pertinent regulator for light-cone/rapidity divergences (or zero modes). As such, standard lattice QCD studies have been limited to indirect parton observables such as first few moments and short-distance correlations, which do not provide the $x$-distributions without solving the model-dependent inverse problem. Here I describe an alternative formulation of partons in terms of equal-time (or Euclidean) correlators, which allows to compute precision-controlled $x$-distribution through lattice QCD simulations. This approach is in accord with Weinberg's pioneering idea of effective field theory as well as Wilson's renormalization group, in which the large hadron momentum serves as a natural cut-off for light-cone/rapidity divergences and can ultimately be eliminated through a method like the ``perfect action'' program in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Transverse force distributions in the proton from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry has been the focus of much attention in QCD phenomenology and is yet to be understood at the quark level. In this Letter, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. We determine a spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces on the order of 3 GeV/fm. These distributions offer a complementary picture of the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approaching the challenge to understand fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with understanding the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss first and second-order phase transitions and emerging new states including long-lived metastable states. We also discuss transitions between metastable states, chemical reactions and their products. These examples show that different values of FPCs would disable these transitions, and new phases as a result of these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling transitions which give rise to new states, act to increase the phase space and entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the late-time asymptotic solutions, attractor, and focusing behavior of minimal causal spin hydrodynamics in Bjorken expansion. Using the method of dominant balance, we derive the late-time asymptotic solutions of the evolution equation for spin density and identify the specific conditions necessary for the spin density to exhibit a power-law decay. We then analyze both the late-time and early-time attractors for the decay rate of spin density. Additionally, we report the focusing behavior in spin hydrodynamics, which has not been found in conventional relativistic hydrodynamics in Bjorken expansion. Our findings suggest that spin density can be treated as a conventional hydrodynamic variable at late times under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pion-nucleon contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate contributions of excited states to nucleon matrix elements computed in lattice QCD by employing, in addition to the standard nucleon interpolating operator, pion-nucleon ($\pi$-$N$) operators. We solve a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to obtain an optimal interpolating operator that minimizes overlap with the $\pi$-$N$ states. We derive a variant of the standard application of the GEVP method, which allows for constructing 3-point correlation functions using the optimized interpolating operator without requiring the computationally demanding combination that includes $\pi$-$N$ operators in both sink and source. We extract nucleon matrix elements using two twisted mass fermion ensembles, one ensemble generated using pion mass of 346 MeV and one ensemble tuned to reproduce the physical value of the pion mass. Especially, we determine the isoscalar and isovector scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial, and tensor matrix elements. We include results obtained using a range of kinematic setups, including momentum in the sink. Our results using this variational approach are compared with previous results obtained using the same ensembles and multi-state fits without GEVP improvement. We find that for the physical mass point ensemble, the improvement, in terms of suppression of excited states using this method, is most significant for the case of the matrix elements of the isovector axial and pseudoscalar currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a "snowball in hell" since it emerges from a hadron gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the "contact" that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Exploring Rapidity-Even Dipolar Flow in Isobaric Collisions at RHIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the AMPT transport model, we investigate the response of the rapidity-even dipolar flow ($\mathrm{v^{even}_{1}}$) and its associated Global Momentum Conservation (GMC) parameter $\mathrm{K}$ to structural disparities within $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr nuclei. We analyze $\rm Ru+Ru$ and $\rm Zr+Zr$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{\textit{s}_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Our analysis demonstrates that the eccentricity $\varepsilon_1$, $\mathrm{v^{even}_{1}}$ and $\mathrm{K}$ exhibit subtle yet discernible sensitivity to the input nuclear structure distinctions between $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr isobars. This observation suggests that measuring $v^{\rm even}_{1}$ and the GMC parameter in these isobaric collisions could serve as a means to fine-tune the comprehension of their nuclear structure disparities and offer insights to enhance the initial condition assumptions of theoretical models.</description>
