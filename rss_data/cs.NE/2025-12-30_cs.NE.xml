      <title>CosineGate: Semantic Dynamic Routing via Cosine Incompatibility in Residual Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep residual networks perform substantial redundant computation by evaluating all residual blocks for every input, even when identity mappings suffice. We introduce CosineGate, an end-to-end differentiable architecture for dynamic routing in residual networks that uses cosine incompatibility between identity and residual feature representations as a self-supervised skip signal. CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction. These results match or exceed ResNet-20 (91.3 percent) while reducing computation, without auxiliary supervision, distillation, or task-specific heuristics. Our results demonstrate that simple geometric measures of feature incompatibility provide a principled and effective signal for dynamic residual routing.</description>

      <title>Annotated History of Modern AI and Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is the science of credit assignment. It seeks to find patterns in observations that explain and predict the consequences of events and actions. This then helps to improve future performance. Minsky's so-called "fundamental credit assignment problem" (1963) surfaces in all sciences including physics (why is the world the way it is?) and history (which persons/ideas/actions have shaped society and civilisation?). Here I focus on the history of ML itself. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) is dominated by artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep learning, both of which are conceptually closer to the old field of cybernetics than what was traditionally called AI (e.g., expert systems and logic programming). A modern history of AI &amp; ML must emphasize breakthroughs outside the scope of shallow AI text books. In particular, it must cover the mathematical foundations of today's NNs such as the chain rule (1676), the first NNs (circa 1800), the first practical AI (1914), the theory of AI and its limitations (1931-34), and the first working deep learning algorithms (1965-). From the perspective of 2025, I provide a timeline of the most significant events in the history of NNs, ML, deep learning, AI, computer science, and mathematics in general, crediting the individuals who laid the field's foundations. The text contains numerous hyperlinks to relevant overview sites. With a ten-year delay, it supplements my 2015 award-winning deep learning survey which provides hundreds of additional references. Finally, I will put things in a broader historical context, spanning from the Big Bang to when the universe will be many times older than it is now.</description>

      <title>Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reservoir computing, an input sequence is processed by a recurrent neural network, the reservoir, which transforms it into a spatial pattern that a shallow readout network can then exploit for tasks such as memorization and time-series prediction or classification. Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training. Finally, we characterize the geometry of the readout networks in ESNs, which reveals that many ESN models exhibit a similar regular simplex geometry as has been observed in the output weights of deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning using Forgetting Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern computer systems store vast amounts of personal data, enabling advances in AI and ML but risking user privacy and trust. For privacy reasons, it is sometimes desired for an ML model to forget part of the data it was trained on. In this paper, we introduce a novel unlearning approach based on Forgetting Neural Networks (FNNs), a neuroscience-inspired architecture that explicitly encodes forgetting through multiplicative decay factors. While FNNs had previously been studied as a theoretical construct, we provide the first concrete implementation and demonstrate their effectiveness for targeted unlearning. We propose several variants with per-neuron forgetting factors, including rank-based assignments guided by activation levels, and evaluate them on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. Our method systematically removes information associated with forget sets while preserving performance on retained data. Membership inference attacks confirm the effectiveness of FNN-based unlearning in erasing information about the training data from the neural network. These results establish FNNs as a promising foundation for efficient and interpretable unlearning.</description>

      <title>Symphony: A Heuristic Normalized Calibrated Advantage Actor and Critic Algorithm in application for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.</description>
