      <title>Understanding the Effect of Market Risks on New Pension System and Government Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how market risks impact the sustainability and performance of the New Pension System (NPS). NPS relies on defined contributions from both employees and employers to build a corpus during the employee's service period. Upon retirement, employees use the corpus fund to sustain their livelihood. A critical concern for individuals is whether the corpus will grow sufficiently to be sustainable or if it will deplete, leaving them financially vulnerable at an advanced age. We explore the impact of market risks on the performance of the corpus resulting from the NPS. To address this, we quantify market risks using Monte Carlo simulations with historical data to model their impact on NPS. We quantify the risk of pension corpus being insufficient and the cost to the Government to hedge the risk arising from guaranteeing the pension.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the degree of risk aversion of spectral risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a functional on the space of spectral risk measures that quantifies their ``degree of risk aversion''. This quantification formalizes the idea that some risk measures are ``more risk-averse'' than others. I construct the functional using two axioms: a normalization on the space of CVaRs and a linearity axiom. I present two formulas for the functional and discuss several properties and interpretations.</description>

      <title>Super-efficiency of Listed Banks in China and Determinants Analysis (2006-2021)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study employs the annual unbalanced panel data of 42 listed banks in China from 2006 to 2021, adopts the non-radial and non-oriented super-efficiency Data envelopment analysis (Super-SBM-UND-VRS based DEA) model considering NPL as undesired output. Our results show that the profitability super-efficiency of State-owned banks and Rural/City Commercial Banks is better than that of Joint-stock Banks. In terms of intermediary efficiency(deposit and loan), state-owned banks have advantage on other two type of banks. The determinants analysis shows that all type of banks significantly benefits from the decrease of ownership concentration which support reformation and IPO. Regional commercial banks significantly benefit from the decrease of customer concentration and the increase of reserves. On the other hand, State-owned banks should increase its loan to deposit ratio while joint-stock banks should do the opposite.</description>
