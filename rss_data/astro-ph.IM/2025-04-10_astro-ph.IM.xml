      <title>AI-Driven Reconstruction of Large-Scale Structure from Combined Photometric and Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.</description>

      <title>AstroClearNet: Deep image prior for multi-frame astronomical image restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity images of the night sky from blurred observations is a fundamental problem in astronomy, where traditional methods typically fall short. In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.</description>

      <title>End-to-end design framework for compressed on-chip pixel-wise spectro-polarimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern detector manufacturing allows spectral and polarimetric filters to be directly integrated on top of separate detector pixels. This enables the creation of CubeSat-sized spectro-polarimetric instruments that are not much larger than the detector and a lens. Redundancy inherent to the observed scene, offers the opportunity for sparse sampling in the form of not scanning all filters at every location. However, when there are fewer pushbroom steps than filters, data are missing in the resulting data cube. The missing, largely redundant data can be filled in with interpolation methods, often called demosaicers. The choice of filters and their precise layout influences the performance of the instrument after the demosaicing process. In these proceedings we describe a part of a design toolbox for both the filter layout and the optimum parameters for the reconstruction to a full spectro-polarimetric data cube. The design tool is based on training a (neural) network and jointly updating the values of the filters and demosaicer. We optimized a filter layout by training on spectro-polarimetric remote observations of the Earth acquired by SPEX airborne. This optimised filter layout could reconstruct a validation scene from five overlapping snapshots (pushbroom steps), which would take 109 pushbroom steps when measuring with a classical layout and no reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Component Separation for DESI LAE Automated Spectroscopic Redshifts and Photometric Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are valuable high-redshift cosmological probes traditionally identified using specialized narrow-band photometric surveys. In ground-based spectroscopy, it can be difficult to distinguish the sharp LAE peak from residual sky emission lines using automated methods, leading to misclassified redshifts. We present a Bayesian spectral component separation technique to automatically determine spectroscopic redshifts for LAEs while marginalizing over sky residuals. We use visually inspected spectra of LAEs obtained using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to create a data-driven prior and can determine redshift by jointly inferring sky residual, LAE, and residual components for each individual spectrum. We demonstrate this method on 910 spectroscopically observed $z = 2-4$ DESI LAE candidate spectra and determine their redshifts with $&gt;$90% accuracy when validated against visually inspected redshifts. Using the $\Delta \chi^2$ value from our pipeline as a proxy for detection confidence, we then explore potential survey design choices and implications for targeting LAEs with medium-band photometry. This method allows for scalability and accuracy in determining redshifts from DESI spectra, and the results provide recommendations for LAE targeting in anticipation of future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Combining high-contrast imaging with high-resolution spectroscopy: Actual on-sky MIRI/MRS results compared to expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CONTEXT: Combining high-contrast imaging with high-resolution spectroscopy offers a powerful way to detect and characterize exoplanets around nearby stars, despite challenges linked to their faintness. Instruments like VLT/SPHERE are state of the art in high-contrast imaging, but their spectral resolution (R=50) limits them to basic characterization of close companions. These systems can detect planets down to 5-10 Mjup at 10 AU from their stars. Detection limits are mainly constrained by speckle noise, which dominates over photon and detector noise at short separations, even with advanced differential imaging. Space-based high-contrast imaging is also limited by image stability. Speckle noise can, however, be mitigated through molecular mapping, a technique that leverages high-resolution spectroscopic data.
  AIMS: We aim to predict detection limits in spectro-imaging after molecular mapping, analyzing how photon and detector noise propagate and comparing predictions with real data to assess performance losses from instrumental effects. We also propose mitigation strategies and validate our model using observations.
  METHODS: We analyzed JWST/MIRI/MRS data with FastCurves, an numerical tool, and compared results to outputs from the MIRI simulator. We also applied principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and isolate systematic effects, with and without molecular mapping.
  RESULTS: We studied various systematic effects and their impacts on signal and noise. PCA helped highlight and reduce straylight, fringes, and aliasing. We further compared observed and modeled companion spectra.
  CONCLUSIONS: FastCurves was improved to account for systematics and validated with real data. In high-flux regimes, systematics impose contrast limits even with molecular mapping. Our approach could benefit other instruments and inform the planning of future facilities like ELT/ANDES and ELT/PCS.</description>

      <title>MOA-2010-BLG-328: Keck and HST Expose the Limits of Occams Razor in Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high resolution follow-up data of the planetary microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-328, using Keck and the Hubble. Keck data, taken 8 years after the event, reveal a strong lens detection enabling a direct measurement of lens flux and source-lens relative proper motion. We find the relative source-lens proper motion to be $\mu_{\rm rel, Hel} = 4.07 \pm 0.34\ \rm mas\ yr^{-1}$, with the lens being $\sim10$ times fainter than the source. The lens was very faint in the Hubble passbands, and the small lens-source separation of $\sim$35 mas made its detection difficult. However, we obtained estimates of the lens magnitudes in Hubble bands by constraining its location to match the Keck K-band detection. The original analysis by \citet{Furusawa2013} reports a degenerate light curve, with several viable models depending on higher-order effects. We attempt to break the degeneracy by remodeling the event using constraints from follow-up data. Our best fit model includes parallax, orbital motion, xallarap and the magnification of a source companion. Models omitting any of these are excluded. However, even with a lens detection the solution remains unclear, as the degeneracy between a nearby late M dwarf and a distant early M dwarf in the disk persists, and cannot be broken with NIR data alone. We conclude the lens is either a $\sim0.2\ M_{\odot}$ star at $2-3$kpc, or a $\sim0.5\ M_{\odot}$ star at $4-5$kpc. This study highlights the importance of multi-band data and comprehensive modeling to resolve microlensing degeneracies.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Comptonizing medium of the black-hole candidate Swift J1727.8$-$1613 along the hard to hard-intermediate state transition using NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the properties of the Comptonizing medium in the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 using the time-dependent Comptonization model vkompth, using NICER observations of type-C QPOs in the hard and hard-intermediate states. During the 2023 outburst of the source, we measure the rms and phase lags of the QPO across 45 observations as the QPO frequency, $\nu_{\rm QPO}$, evolves from $\sim 0.3$ Hz to $\sim 7$ Hz. By simultaneously fitting the time-averaged spectrum of the source and the rms and lag spectra of the QPO, we derive the evolution of the disk and corona parameters. At $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 0.34$ Hz, the QPO phase lags are hard, with 10 keV photons lagging 0.5 keV photons by $\sim 0.5$ rad. As $\nu_{\rm QPO}$ increases, the lags for the same energy bands decrease, reaching near zero at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 1.2$ Hz, and then reverse to soft lags of $\sim -1.1$ rad at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 7$ Hz. Initially, the inner radius of the accretion disk is truncated at $\sim 30-40 R_g$ (assuming a 10 solar-mass black hole) and, as the QPO frequency increases, the truncation radius decreases down to $\sim 10 R_g$. Initially, two coronas of sizes of $\sim 6.5 \times 10^3$ km and $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km, extend over the disk and are illuminated by different regions of the disk. As the QPO frequency increases, both the coronas shrink to $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km at $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 2.5$ Hz. Following a data gap, one corona expands again, peaking at a size of $\sim 2 \times 10^4$ km. We interpret the evolution of the coronal size in the context of accompanying radio observations, discussing its implications for the interplay between the corona and the jet.</description>

      <title>Photobombing for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). A new criterion for target confusion and application to a MIR rotating nulling interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary objectives in modern astronomy is to discover and study planets with characteristics similar to Earth. This pursuit involves analyzing the spectra of exoplanets and searching for biosignatures. Contamination of spectra by nearby objects (e.g., other planets and moons in the same system) is a significant concern and must be addressed for future exo-Earth searching missions. The aim is to estimate, for habitable planets, the probability of spectral contamination by other planets within the same star system. This investigation focuses on the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). Since the Rayleigh criterion is inapplicable to interferometers such as those proposed for LIFE, we present new criteria based on the principle of parsimony, which take into account two types of issues: contamination or blending of point sources, and cancellation of point sources due to destructive interference. We define a new spatial resolution metric associated with contamination or cancellation that generalizes to a broader family of observing instruments. In the current baseline design, LIFE is an X-array architecture nulling interferometer. Our investigation reveals that its transmission map introduces the potential for two point sources to appear as one, even if they do not appear in close proximity. We find that LIFE has a spatial resolution comparable to that of a traditional telescope with a diameter of $D = 600\,\text{m}$, observing at $\lambda = 4 \,\mu\text{m}$. Our survey of a star system population shows that, out of 73.4 expected habitable planets detected, 71.3 are not contaminated on average.</description>

      <title>What if we find nothing? Bayesian analysis of the statistical information of null results in future exoplanet habitability and biosignature surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future telescopes will survey temperate, terrestrial exoplanets to estimate the frequency of habitable ($\eta_{\text{Hab}}$) or inhabited ($\eta_{\text{Life}}$) planets. This study aims to determine the minimum number of planets ($N$) required to draw statistically significant conclusions, particularly in the case of a null result (i.e., no detections). Using a Bayesian framework, we analyzed surveys of up to $N=100$ planets to infer the frequency of a binary observable feature ($\eta_{\text{obs}}$) after null results. Posterior best fits and upper limits were derived for various survey sizes and compared with predicted yields from missions like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Our findings indicate that $N=20-50$ ``perfect'' observations (100\% confidence in detecting or excluding the feature) yield conclusions relatively independent of priors. To achieve 99.9\% upper limits of $\eta_{\text{obs}} \leq 0.2/0.1$, approximately $N \simeq 40/80$ observations are needed. For ``imperfect'' observations, uncertainties in interpretation and sample biases become limiting factors. We show that LIFE and HWO aim for sufficiently large survey sizes to provide statistically meaningful estimates of habitable environments and life prevalence under these assumptions. However, robust conclusions require careful sample selection and high-confidence detection or exclusion of features in each observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal experimental challenge when studying radiation effects on cryogenic devices is to precisely and accurately characterize the position-dependent device response very near the energy detection threshold. We have developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be used to generate O({\mu}s) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy range of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber optic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at cryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of any photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can be used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the position sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and study the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe the design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained with a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We present a differentiable, end-to-end Bayesian forward modeling framework for line intensity mapping cosmology experiments, with a specific focus on low-frequency radio telescopes targeting the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen as a cosmological probe. Our framework is capable of posterior density estimation of the cosmological signal jointly with foreground and telescope parameters at the field level. Our key aim is to be able to optimize the model's high-dimensional, non-linear, and ill-conditioned parameter space, while also sampling from it to perform robust uncertainty quantification within a Bayesian framework. We show how a differentiable programming paradigm, accelerated by recent advances in machine learning software and hardware, can make this computationally-demanding, end-to-end Bayesian approach feasible. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a simplified signal recovery problem for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment, highlighting the framework's ability to build confidence in early 21 cm signal detections even in the presence of poorly understood foregrounds and instrumental systematics. We use a Hessian-preconditioned Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample our parameter space with a dimensionality approaching $N\sim10^5$, which enables joint, end-to-end nuisance parameter marginalization over foreground and instrumental terms. Lastly, we introduce a new spherical harmonic formalism that is a complete and orthogonal basis on the cut sky relevant to drift-scan radio surveys, which we call the spherical stripe harmonic formalism, and it's associated three-dimensional basis, the spherical stripe Fourier-Bessel formalism.</description>

      <title>Cross-Correlated Force Measurement for Thermal Noise Reduction in Torsion Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The torsion pendulum is a prevailing instrument for measuring small forces acting on a solid body or those between solid bodies. While it offers powerful advantages, the measurement precision suffers from thermal noises of the suspending wires giving rise to stochastic torque noises. This paper proposes a new scheme to reduce the effect of such noise by employing a double torsion pendulum and cross-correlation technique based on the theoretical analysis that the thermal torque noise appears at each end of the suspending wire differentially. Cross-correlating two synthesized data streams which are composed of the rotation angles of two torsion stages, it yields the power spectral density estimate of external forces acting on the lower stage with the reduced effect from the thermal torque noises. As an example use case, we discuss the application to the study on the coupling strength of ultra light dark matter to standard model particles. Our evaluation indicates that the upper limit may be improved by an order of magnitude than the previous experiments at 2 mHz, which corresponds to about $8\times10^{-18}$ eV.</description>

      <title>FAST Drift Scan Survey for HI Intensity Mapping. II. Stacking-based Beam Construction of the 19-feed Array at $1.4$ GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) presents great promise for future cosmological large-scale structure surveys. However, a major challenge for HIIM cosmological studies is to accurately subtract the foreground contamination. An accurate beam model is crucial for improving the quality of foreground subtraction. In this work, we develop a stacking-based beam reconstruction method utilizing the radio continuum point sources within the drift-scan field. Based on the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we employ two sets of drift-scan survey data and merge the measurements to construct the beam patterns of the 19 FAST L-band feeds. To model the beams, we utilize the Zernike polynomial (ZP), which effectively captures asymmetric features of the main beam and the different side lobes. Due to the symmetric location of the beams, the main features of the beams are closely related to the distance from the center of the feed array, e.g., as the distance increases, side lobes become more pronounced. This modeling pipeline leverages the stable drift-scan data to extract beam patterns while accounting for and excluding the reflector's changing effects. It provides a more accurate measurement beam and a more precise model beam for FAST HIIM cosmology surveys.</description>

      <title>Event-based Detectors for Laser Guide Star Tip-Tilt Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-based sensors detect only changes in brightness across a scene, with each pixel producing an asynchronous stream of spatial-temporal data, rather than recording frames of overall illumination such as a traditional frame-based sensor. This is advantageous for implementing into a wavefront sensor, which benefits from high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. The determination of tip-tilt in particular is still a problem in laser guide star (LGS) adaptive optics as there are no current technological capabilities to measure it. We characterized the behavior of an event-based sensor in the context of tip-tilt sensing, investigating if the high temporal resolution of the event streams could address these challenges. Different conditions of tip-tilt and background illumination levels are explored and found to be a strong contender for tip-tilt sensing with LGSs.</description>

      <title>Measuring Type Ia Supernova Angular-Diameter Distances with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of intensity interferometry, based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, for measuring supernova sizes and distances. Through optimized telescope positioning, observing strategy, and advancements in single-photon detection technology, this method can provide precise angular size measurements of Type Ia supernovae as bright as 12~mag, corresponding to a local volume out to $z\sim0.004$, with an anticipated rate of $\sim 1$ events per year. The combination of angular size data with known physical dimensions enables accurate distance determination. Multiple telescope pairs at different relative positions allow tomographic mapping of the ejecta structure while reducing distance uncertainties. As Type Ia supernovae serve as standardizable candles for measuring the Universe's expansion history, combining intensity interferometry distances with the supernova Hubble diagram facilitates measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Ray Tracing, Reacting Flow and Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiation, and radiation-matter interactions are important processes which are computationally difficult to model in astrophysical simulations, addressed by introducing novel algorithms optimized for heterogeneous architectures in the Kratos framework. Key innovations include a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent chemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding matrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for multi-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary differential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements efficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter interactions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection, combustion, Str\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely matching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations position it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in the diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (193 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (129 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (102 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <title>$\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe $\tt GrayHawk$, a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray-body factors for massless fields with spin \(s = 0, 1/2, 1, 2\) in modes specified by the angular quantum number \(l\), given a black hole metric and the associated parameter values. $\tt GrayHawk$ is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. Additionally, its modular structure allows users to extend its functionality easily by incorporating alternative metrics or configurations. This versatility makes $\tt GrayHawk$ a powerful and adaptable resource for researchers studying black hole physics and Hawking radiation. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>
