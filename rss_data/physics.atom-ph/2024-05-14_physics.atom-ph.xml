      <title>Bremsstrahlung of 5-25 keV electrons incident on MoSi$_2$, TiB$_2$ and ZrB$_2$ thick solid conductive compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute measurements were conducted to study the bremsstrahlung emission from ~5-25 keV electrons incident on three thick solid conductive compounds of MoSi$_2$, TiB$_2$ and ZrB$_2$. The additivity approximation was applied in the Monte Carlo PENELOPE simulations for compounds and mixtures. The results showed that in general the experimental bremsstrahlung spectra were in good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation results, suggesting the feasibility of the additivity approximation in Monte Carlo simulations for the studied cases even in the absolute measurements and that the significant differences between experiments and Monte Carlo simulations near the Duane-Hunt limit for insulating targets in previous studies do not appear in the present studies.</description>

      <title>Laser-painted cavity-mediated interactions in a quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental platforms based on ultracold atomic gases have significantly advanced the quantum simulation of complex systems, yet the exploration of phenomena driven by long-range interactions remains a formidable challenge. Currently available methods utilizing dipolar quantum gases or multi-mode cavities allow to implement long-range interactions with a $1/r^3$ character or with a spatial profile fixed by the mode-structure of the vacuum electromagnetic field surrounding the atoms, respectively. Here we propose an experimental scheme employing laser-painted cavity-mediated interactions, which enables the realization of atom-atom interactions that are fully tunable in range, shape, and sign. Our approach combines the versatility of cavity quantum electrodynamics with the precision of laser manipulation, thus providing a highly flexible platform for simulating and understanding long-range interactions in quantum many-body systems. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations describing the full dynamics of atoms, laser, and cavity. The latter demonstrate that there is a wide and experimentally accessible parameter regime where our protocol optimally works. The methodology not only paves the way for exploring new territories in quantum simulation but also enhances the understanding of fundamental physics, potentially leading to the discovery of novel quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of the channeling process with account for ionizing collisions: Preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of simulations of the channeling process with account for the ionizing collisions that accompany the passage of a charged projectile in a crystalline medium. The simulations have been performed by means of the \MBNExplorer software package. taking into account that ionizing collisions are random, fast and local they can be incorporated into the classical molecular dynamics framework according to their probabilities. The description of this methodology is given in the paper. The case studies presented refer to channeling of 195, 270 \&amp; 855 MeV electrons and of 270 \&amp; 500 MeV positrons in single diamond crystals along the (111) (electrons) and (110) (positrons) planar directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation Using Large Spin Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation explores quantum computation using qudits encoded into large spins, emphasizing the concept of quantum co-design to harness the unique capabilities of physical platforms for enhanced quantum information processing. First, we delve into the generation of high-fidelity universal gate sets for quantum computation with qudits. Leveraging principles from quantum optimal control, Rydberg physics, and the atomic structure of alkaline-earth atoms, we propose protocols for high-fidelity universal gate sets in the ground state of 87Sr with reasonable experimental parameters. Next, we analyze schemes to encode a qubit in the large spin qudits for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). By comprehending the most dominant noise in the physical system, we develop FTQC protocols that outperform the standard protocols. Finally, considering spin qudits for neutral atom quantum computation, we studied protocols for converting leakage errors to erasure errors resource efficiently. Also, we developed cooling methods for neutral atoms without destroying the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Sensing with Multiparameter Decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of a quantum sensor is fundamentally limited by noise. This noise is particularly damaging when it becomes correlated with the readout of a target signal, caused by fluctuations of the sensor's operating parameters. These uncertainties limit sensitivity in a way that can be understood with multiparameter estimation theory. We develop a new approach, adaptable to any quantum platform, for designing robust sensing protocols that leverages multiparameter estimation theory and machine learning to decorrelate a target signal from fluctuating off-target (``nuisance'') parameters. Central to our approach is the identification of information-theoretic goals that guide a machine learning agent through an otherwise intractably large space of potential sensing protocols. As an illustrative example, we apply our approach to a reconfigurable optical lattice to design an accelerometer whose sensitivity is decorrelated from lattice depth noise. We demonstrate the effect of decorrelation on outcomes and Bayesian inferencing through statistical analysis in parameter space, and discuss implications for future applications in quantum metrology and computing.</description>

      <title>On the computation of moments in the Super-Transition-Arrays model for radiative opacity calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Super-Transition-Array statistical method for the computation of radiative opacity of hot dense matter, the moments of the absorption or emission features involve partition functions with reduced degeneracies, occurring through the calculation of averages of products of subshell populations. In the present work, we discuss several aspects of the computation of such peculiar partition functions, insisting on the precautions that must be taken in order to avoid numerical difficulties. In a previous work, we derived a formula for supershell partition functions, which takes the form of a functional of the distribution of energies within the supershell and allows for fast and accurate computations, truncating the number of terms in the expansion. The latter involves coefficients for which we obtained a recursion relation and an explicit formula. We show that such an expansion can be combined with the recurrence relation for shifted partition functions. We also propose, neglecting the effect of fine structure as a first step, a positive-definite formula for the Super-Transition-Array moments of any order, providing an insight into the asymmetry and sharpness of the latter. The corresponding formulas are free of alternating sums. Several ways to speed up the calculations are also presented.</description>

      <title>Successive quasienergy collapse and breakdown of photon blockade in the few-emitter limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergent behavior that arises in many-body systems of increasing size follows universal laws that become apparent in order-to-disorder transitions. While this behavior has been traditionally studied for large numbers of emitters, recent progress allows for the exploration of the few-emitter limit, where correlations can be measured and connected to microscopic models to gain further insight into order-to-disorder transitions. We explore this few-body limit in the driven and damped Tavis--Cummings model, which describes a collection of atoms interacting with a driven and damped cavity mode. Our exploration revolves around the dressed states of the atomic ensemble and field, whose energies are shown to collapse as the driving field is increased to mark the onset of a dissipative quantum phase transition. The collapse occurs in stages and is an effect of light-matter correlations that are overlooked for single atoms and neglected in mean-field models. The implications of these correlations over the macroscopic observables of the system are presented. We encounter a shift in the expected transition point and an increased number of parity-broken states to choose from once the ordered phase is reached.</description>

      <title>New bounds on heavy axions with an X-ray free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range 10^{-3} eV \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{4} eV, which is relatively unconstrained by laboratory searches. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3$^{\rm rd}$ generation synchrotron (Yamaji et al. 2018) our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>
