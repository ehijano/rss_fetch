      <title>Covering a Graph with Dense Subgraph Families, via Triangle-Rich Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to represent relationships in domains as diverse as the social sciences, bioinformatics, cybersecurity, the Internet, and more. One of the central observations in network science is that real-world graphs are globally sparse, yet contains numerous "pockets" of high edge density. A fundamental task in graph mining is to discover these dense subgraphs. Most common formulations of the problem involve finding a single (or a few) "optimally" dense subsets. But in most real applications, one does not care for the optimality. Instead, we want to find a large collection of dense subsets that covers a significant fraction of the input graph.
  We give a mathematical formulation of this problem, using a new definition of regularly triangle-rich (RTR) families. These families capture the notion of dense subgraphs that contain many triangles and have degrees comparable to the subgraph size. We design a provable algorithm, RTRExtractor, that can discover RTR families that approximately cover any RTR set. The algorithm is efficient and is inspired by recent results that use triangle counts for community testing and clustering.
  We show that RTRExtractor has excellent behavior on a large variety of real-world datasets. It is able to process graphs with hundreds of millions of edges within minutes. Across many datasets, RTRExtractor achieves high coverage using high edge density datasets. For example, the output covers a quarter of the vertices with subgraphs of edge density more than (say) $0.5$, for datasets with 10M+ edges. We show an example of how the output of RTRExtractor correlates with meaningful sets of similar vertices in a citation network, demonstrating the utility of RTRExtractor for unsupervised graph discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>BlueTempNet: A Temporal Multi-network Dataset of Social Interactions in Bluesky Social</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized social media platforms like Bluesky Social (Bluesky) have made it possible to publicly disclose some user behaviors with millisecond-level precision. Embracing Bluesky's principles of open-source and open-data, we present the first collection of the temporal dynamics of user-driven social interactions. BlueTempNet integrates multiple types of networks into a single multi-network, including user-to-user interactions (following and blocking users) and user-to-community interactions (creating and joining communities). Communities are user-formed groups in custom Feeds, where users subscribe to posts aligned with their interests. Following Bluesky's public data policy, we collect existing Bluesky Feeds, including the users who liked and generated these Feeds, and provide tools to gather users' social interactions within a date range. This data-collection strategy captures past user behaviors and supports the future data collection of user behavior.</description>

      <title>Balanced Multi-Relational Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-relational graph clustering has demonstrated remarkable success in uncovering underlying patterns in complex networks. Representative methods manage to align different views motivated by advances in contrastive learning. Our empirical study finds the pervasive presence of imbalance in real-world graphs, which is in principle contradictory to the motivation of alignment. In this paper, we first propose a novel metric, the Aggregation Class Distance, to empirically quantify structural disparities among different graphs. To address the challenge of view imbalance, we propose Balanced Multi-Relational Graph Clustering (BMGC), comprising unsupervised dominant view mining and dual signals guided representation learning. It dynamically mines the dominant view throughout the training process, synergistically improving clustering performance with representation learning. Theoretical analysis ensures the effectiveness of dominant view mining. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis on real-world and synthetic datasets showcase that BMGC achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its superiority in addressing the view imbalance inherent in multi-relational graphs.

      <title>Gender disparities in the dissemination and acquisition of scientific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has challenged the widespread belief that gender inequities in academia would disappear simply by increasing the number of women. More complex causes might be at play, embodied in the networked structure of scientific collaborations. Here, we aim to understand the structural inequality between male and female scholars in the dissemination of scientific knowledge. We use a large-scale dataset of academic publications from the American Physical Society (APS) to build a time-varying network of collaborations from 1970 to 2020. We model knowledge dissemination as a contagion process in which scientists become informed based on the propagation of knowledge through their collaborators. We quantify the fairness of the system in terms of how women acquire and diffuse knowledge compared to men. Our results indicate that knowledge acquisition and diffusion are slower for women than expected. We find that the main determinant of women's disadvantage is the gap in the cumulative number of collaborators, highlighting how time creates structural disadvantages that contribute to marginalize women in physics. Our work sheds light on how the dynamics of scientific collaborations shape gender disparities in knowledge dissemination and calls for a deeper understanding on how to intervene to improve fairness and diversity in the scientific community.</description>

      <title>When Does Bottom-up Beat Top-down in Hierarchical Community Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering of networks consists in finding a tree of communities, such that lower levels of the hierarchy reveal finer-grained community structures. There are two main classes of algorithms tackling this problem. Divisive ($\textit{top-down}$) algorithms recursively partition the nodes into two communities, until a stopping rule indicates that no further split is needed. In contrast, agglomerative ($\textit{bottom-up}$) algorithms first identify the smallest community structure and then repeatedly merge the communities using a $\textit{linkage}$ method. In this article, we establish theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably, these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the superiority of bottom-up algorithms over top-down algorithms. We also observe that top-down algorithms can produce dendrograms with inversions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of hierarchical clustering techniques and their applications in network analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning from Graphs with Heterophily: Progress and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs are structured data that models complex relations between real-world entities. Heterophilous graphs, where linked nodes are prone to be with different labels or dissimilar features, have recently attracted significant attention and found many applications. Meanwhile, increasing efforts have been made to advance learning from heterophilous graphs. Although there exist surveys on the relevant topic, they focus on heterophilous GNNs, which are only sub-topics of heterophilous graph learning. In this survey, we comprehensively overview existing works on learning from graphs with heterophily.First, we collect over 180 publications and introduce the development of this field. Then, we systematically categorize existing methods based on a hierarchical taxonomy including learning strategies, model architectures and practical applications. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges of existing studies and highlight promising avenues for future research.More publication details and corresponding open-source codes can be accessed and will be continuously updated at our repositories:https://github.com/gongchenghua/Papers-Graphs-with-Heterophily.</description>

      <title>The Uneven Impact of Mobility on the Segregation of Native and Foreign-born Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segregation is a key challenge in promoting more diverse and inclusive cities. Research based on smartphone data has revealed that segregation can extend beyond residential areas into everyday activities like visiting shops and restaurants. The impact of these activities on segregation, however, is unclear. Some studies suggest that they promote mixing, while others indicate they reinforce segregation. Here, we elucidate how day-to-day mobility shapes overall segregation levels, looking at the distinctive segregation experienced by native and foreign-born individuals. Our study is based on ~320,000 smartphone trajectories collected in Sweden, where immigration creates profound divides. We find that while mobility levels generally promote mixing for native-born individuals, foreign-born individuals remain segregated in their out-of-home activities. Using counterfactual simulations, we show that this heterogeneous effect of mobility on experienced segregation results mainly from two mechanisms: homophily and limited travel, i.e., foreign-born individuals (i) prefer destinations visited by similar individuals, and (ii) have limited mobility ranges. We show that homophily plays a minor role, while limited mobility, associated with reduced transport access, limits opportunities for foreign-born to diversify their encounters. Our findings reconcile conflicting literature and suggest that enhancing transport accessibility in foreign-born areas could reduce social segregation.</description>

      <title>A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Commuting Origin-destination Matrix Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The commuting origin-destination~(OD) matrix is a critical input for urban planning and transportation, providing crucial information about the population residing in one region and working in another within an interested area. Despite its importance, obtaining and updating the matrix is challenging due to high costs and privacy concerns. This has spurred research into generating commuting OD matrices for areas lacking historical data, utilizing readily available information via computational models. In this regard, existing research is primarily restricted to only a single or few large cities, preventing these models from being applied effectively in other areas with distinct characteristics, particularly in towns and rural areas where such data is urgently needed. To address this, we propose a large-scale dataset comprising commuting OD matrices for 3,233 diverse areas around the U.S. For each area, we provide the commuting OD matrix, combined with regional attributes including demographics and point-of-interests of each region in that area. We believe this comprehensive dataset will facilitate the development of more generalizable commuting OD matrix generation models, which can capture various patterns of distinct areas. Additionally, we use this dataset to benchmark a set of commuting OD generation models, including physical models, element-wise predictive models, and matrix-wise generative models. Surprisingly, we find a new paradigm, which considers the whole area combined with its commuting OD matrix as an attributed directed weighted graph and generates the weighted edges based on the node attributes, can achieve the optimal. This may inspire a new research direction from graph learning in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Number of IoT enabled devices are being tried and introduced every year and there is a healthy competition among researched and businesses to capitalize the space created by IoT, as these devices have a great market potential. Depending on the type of task involved and sensitive nature of data that the device handles, various IoT architectures, communication protocols and components are chosen and their performance is evaluated. This paper reviews such IoT enabled devices based on their architecture, communication protocols and functions in few key socially relevant fields like health care, farming, firefighting, women/individual safety/call for help/harm alert, home surveillance and mapping as these fields involve majority of the general public. It can be seen, to one's amazement, that already significant number of devices are being reported on these fields and their performance is promising. This paper also outlines the challenges involved in each of these fields that require solutions to make these devices reliable</description>

      <title>Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and items providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raise the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve items' side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) fairnessaware attention which incorporates dot product in the normalization process of GNNs, to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees, and ii) heterophily feature weighting to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates the unfairness and popularity bias on items' side, but also achieves superior accuracy on users' side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</description>

      <title>SLADE: Detecting Dynamic Anomalies in Edge Streams without Labels via Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To detect anomalies in real-world graphs, such as social, email, and financial networks, various approaches have been developed. While they typically assume static input graphs, most real-world graphs grow over time, naturally represented as edge streams. In this context, we aim to achieve three goals: (a) instantly detecting anomalies as they occur, (b) adapting to dynamically changing states, and (c) handling the scarcity of dynamic anomaly labels. In this paper, we propose SLADE (Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Edge Streams) for rapid detection of dynamic anomalies in edge streams, without relying on labels. SLADE detects the shifts of nodes into abnormal states by observing deviations in their interaction patterns over time. To this end, it trains a deep neural network to perform two self-supervised tasks: (a) minimizing drift in node representations and (b) generating long-term interaction patterns from short-term ones. Failure in these tasks for a node signals its deviation from the norm. Notably, the neural network and tasks are carefully designed so that all required operations can be performed in constant time (w.r.t. the graph size) in response to each new edge in the input stream. In dynamic anomaly detection across four real-world datasets, SLADE outperforms nine competing methods, even those leveraging label supervision.</description>
