      <title>A geometric derivation of Noether's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noether's theorem is a cornerstone of analytical mechanics, making the link between symmetries and conserved quantities. In this article, I propose a simple, geometric derivation of this theorem that circumvents the usual difficulties that a student of this field usually encounters. The derivation is based on the direct use of the differential form $pdq -Hdt$, where $p$ is the momentum and $H$ the Hamiltonian, integrated over a simple curve.</description>

      <title>The swinging counterweight trebuchet. Experiments on inner movement and ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner movement of a trebuchet with swinging counterweight was measured inside a laboratory by the use of rotation sensors to determine angular coordinates for beam, counterweight and sling. Data collection was started before the trebuchet was fired and lasted until some time after the projectile was released and flung into ground right in front of the machine. A single measurement is then sufficient for a semi-empirical determination of longest range and kinetic energy at target as well as mechanical energies and internal forces throughout the entire shot. Loss of mechanical energy was ascertained and attributed to friction. Measurements of actual ranges performed on a flat field with little wind are presented and compared with the semi-empirical determinations and ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Note on the transformation from the Lorenz gauge to the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a simple formula for the gauge function of the transformation from the Lorenz gauge to the Coulomb gauge, valid under a condition that is satisfied by some charge densities employed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Effect of interparticle fields and radiation reaction on beam dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where radiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. However, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during coherent emission. Here, we present: (i) an analytical proof showing that the energy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which is divergence-free and describes a generic system of interacting charges, respects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple generalization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of the total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By performing first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this theory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle fields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined effect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the particle energy distribution. Additionally, our first-principles simulations show that the effect of interparticle fields on beam energy loss becomes smaller when most of the radiated energy is incoherent.</description>

      <title>Elastic rods and elastic spinning rings as gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linearised relativistic elasticity equations of motion are considered for a rod and a spinning ring encountering a gravitational wave. In the case of the rod, the equations reduce to a wave equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Using Fourier transforms, the resonant frequencies are found and an explicit distributional solution is given, both for a plus- and a cross-polarised gravitational wave. In the case of the spinning ring, the equations are coupled wave equations with periodic boundary conditions. Using a Fourier series expansion, the system of wave equations is recast as a family of ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients, which are then solved via Fourier transforms. The resonant frequencies are found, including simple approximate expressions for slowly rotating rings, and an explicit distributional solution is obtained in the case of the non-spinning ring. Interestingly, it is possible to tune the resonant frequencies by adjusting the angular velocity of the spinning ring.</description>
