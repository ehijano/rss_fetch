      <title>Set theory, logic, and homeomorphism groups of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between axiomatic set theory and the first-order theory of homeomorphism groups of manifolds in the language of group theory, concentrating on first-order rigidity and type versus conjugacy. We prove that under the axiom of constructibility (i.e. {V=L}), homeomorphism groups of arbitrary connected manifolds are first-order rigid, and that the conjugacy class of a homeomorphism of a manifold is determined by its type. In contradistinction, under projective determinacy (PD), we show that in all dimensions greater than one, there exist pairs of noncompact, connected manifolds whose homeomorphism groups are elementarily equivalent but which are not homeomorphic. We also show that under PD, every manifold of positive dimension admits pairs of homeomorphisms with the same type which are not conjugate to each other. Finally, we show that infinitary sentences do determine conjugacy classes of homeomorphisms and homeomorphism types of manifolds; specifically, the conjugacy class of a homeomorphism of an arbitrary manifold is determined by a single $L_{\omega_1\omega}$ sentence. Similarly, the homeomorphism type of an arbitrary connected manifold is determined by a single $L_{\omega_1\omega}$ sentence.</description>

      <title>The intersection polynomials of a long virtual knot I: Definitions and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce twelve polynomial invariants for long virtual knots, called intersection polynomials, extending and refining the three intersection polynomials for virtual knots. They are defined via intersection numbers of cycles on a closed surface, considering the order of over- and under-crossings. We study their fundamental properties including behavior under symmetries, crossing changes, and concatenation products. All are finite-type invariants of degree two under crossing changes, but not under virtualizations, and we examine their relation to the closure and the values at $t=1$ of their derivatives.</description>

      <title>The intersection polynomials of a long virtual knot II: Two supporting genera and characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the study of the twelve intersection polynomials of long virtual knots, previously introduced in our preceding paper. We define two geometric invariants, the $1$- and $2$-supporting genera, using two distinct surface realizations. These genera yield a natural filtration of the set of long virtual knots, and we analyze the behavior of the intersection polynomials for long virtual knots with small supporting genera. Moreover, we investigate virtual $2$-string tangles, analyzing how their sums with long virtual knots affect the intersection polynomials through right closures. As an application, we provide complete realizability criteria for all twelve intersection polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Alexander polynomials of modular knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed geodesics associated with indefinite binary quadratic forms, or equivalently with real quadratic irrationals, have long been studied as geometric $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-invariants. Building on the Birman-Williams approach to Lorenz knots and following the notion of modular knots introduced by Ghys, this article investigates the topological $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-invariants arising from modular knots. Our main focus is the Alexander polynomial of modular knots. Using the Burau representation, we highlight two contrasting features of this family. On the one hand, for each fixed degree, only finitely many Alexander polynomials of modular knots occur. On the other hand, any integer appears as a coefficient of the Alexander polynomial of some modular knot, and coefficients of the same sign can occur in runs of arbitrarily long length.</description>

      <title>Dimension of the skein module of a Dehn filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a knot $K$ and a generic slope $r$, we study the Kauffman bracket skein module (KBSM) $S(E_K (r) , \mathbb{Q} (A))$ of the Dehn filling $E_K (r)$ of slope $r$ along $K$, assuming that the KBSM $S(E_K , \mathbb{Q} [A^{\pm 1}])$ of the exterior $E_K$ of $K$ is finitely generated over $S(\partial E_K ,\mathbb{Q} [A^{\pm 1}])$. As shown in a paper of Thang L\^e, this condition is satisfied for $K$ a two-bridge knot. In this setting, we show that $\dim_{\mathbb{C}} (S_\zeta (E_K (r))) = \dim_{\mathbb{Q} (A)} (S (E_K (r)))$ for almost all primitive roots of unity $\zeta$ of order $2N$ with $N$ odd, and for almost all slopes $r$. When the character variety of a 3-manifold $M$ is finite, we also discuss the decomposition of $S_\zeta (M)$ in terms of localized skein modules. In particular, the dimension of the localized skein modules at a non-central point is the multiplicity of this point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the skein lasagna theory of Morrison-Walker-Wedrich to 4-manifolds with corners and formulate gluing formulas for 4-manifolds with boundary and, more generally, with corners. As an application, we develop a categorical framework for a presentation of the skein lasagna module of trisected closed 4-manifolds. Further, we extend the theory to dimension two by introducing bicategories for closed oriented surfaces and proving a gluing formula for the categories associated with 3-manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>First-passage percolation, non-positive curvature, and radial maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an infinite connected graph $G$, a way to randomly perturb its metric is to assign random i.i.d. lengths to the edges of the graph, a process called first-passage percolation. Assume that the graph is infinite and of bounded degree. Assume the edge length distribution, $\nu$, has a finite expectation and is supported on $[0, \infty)$. We prove in this paper that non-positive curvature almost surely is not preserved by the associated percolation. In particular, Gromov hyperbolicity and coarse CAT(0) property of graphs are almost surely not preserved. We also show that if a graph contains a Morse geodesic ray, then the resulting image of the ray under first-passage percolation is no longer Morse. Lastly, we show that first-passage percolation almost surely is a radial map on $G$.</description>

      <title>On Sparse Representations of 3-Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-manifolds are commonly represented as triangulations, consisting of abstract tetrahedra whose triangular faces are identified in pairs. The combinatorial sparsity of a triangulation, as measured by the treewidth of its dual graph, plays a fundamental role in the design of parameterized algorithms. In this work, we investigate algorithmic procedures that transform or modify a given triangulation while controlling specific sparsity parameters. First, we describe a linear-time algorithm that converts a given triangulation into a Heegaard diagram of the underlying 3-manifold, showing that the construction preserves treewidth. We apply this construction to exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable framework for computing Kuperberg's quantum invariants of 3-manifolds. Second, we present a quasi-linear-time algorithm that retriangulates a given triangulation into one with maximum edge valence of at most nine, while only moderately increasing the treewidth of the dual graph. Combining these two algorithms yields a quasi-linear-time algorithm that produces, from a given triangulation, a Heegaard diagram in which every attaching curve intersects at most nine others.</description>

      <title>On the integral variation map of isolated plane curves singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integral variation map and algebraic monodromy of isolated plane curve singularities are important homological invariants of the singularity which are still far from being completely understood. This work provides effective ways of computing them with respect to an explicit geometric basis of the homology.
  For any given topological type of plane curve singularity, we construct an analytic model of it, along with a vector field on our version of its A'Campo space. This vector field is tangent to the Milnor fibers at radius zero and the union of the stable manifolds of their singularities yields a spine of each fiber, which can be described explicitly. This is very much inspired by a recent work of the authors.
  Our first main contribution is the algorithmic computation of the algebraic monodromy and integral variation map as matrices with explicit bases for any Milnor fiber in the Milnor fibration, not merely congruence classes. For our second contribution, we introduce gyrographs which are graphs equipped with angular data and rational weights. We prove that the invariant spine naturally carries a gyrograph structure were the weights are given by the Hironaka numbers, and that this structure recovers the geometric monodromy as a homotopy class, as well as the integral variation map. This provides a combinatorial framework for computation by hand. Our methods are further implemented in a publicly availablecomputer program written in Python.</description>

      <title>The Milnor fiber boundary of an arrangement determines its combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary of the Milnor fiber associated with a complex line arrangement is a three dimensional plumbed manifold, and it is a combinatorial invariant. We prove the reverse implication, which was conjectured N\'emethi and Szil\'ard. That is, this boundary of the Milnor fiber determines the combinatorics of the arrangement. Furthermore, we give an explicit method which constructs the poset associated with the arrangement, given a plumbing graph in normal form for the boundary.</description>

Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Ren and Willis gave the first analysis-free proof of the existence of exotic compact, orientable 4-manifolds; their main tool is the Khovanov skein lasagna module defined by Morrison, Walker, and Wedrich. In this paper, we introduce a new, simple way of using Khovanov homology to distinguish certain exotic compact, orientable 4-manifolds; our new method does not depend on the skein lasagna module. As an application, we give the first analysis-free proof of the existence of exotic Mazur manifolds, i.e. compact, contractible 4-manifolds that have handle decompositions with a single 1-handle and a single 2-handle.</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian cycles on ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. This small cover is defined by a Hamiltonian cycle on it. We show that any Hamiltonian cycle on a compact right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope arises in this way, while for a Hamiltonian cycle on a right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope of finite volume the necessary and sufficient condition is that at each ideal vertex it does not go straight. We introduce a transformation of a Eulerian cycle along conjugated vertices allowing to build new cycles from a given one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Hopf invariants, defined by evaluation in Harrison cohomology of the commutative cochains of a space, calculate the logarithm map from a fundamental group to its Malcev Lie algebra. They thus present the zeroth Harrison cohomology as a universal dual object to the Malcev Lie algebra. This structural theorem supports explicit calculations in algebraic topology, geometric topology, and combinatorial group theory. In particular, we give the first algorithm to determine whether a power of a word is a k-fold nested commutator while encoding commutator structure in any group presented by generators and relations.</description>
