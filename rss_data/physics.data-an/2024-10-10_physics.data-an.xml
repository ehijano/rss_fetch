      <title>Bound on forecasting skill for models of North Atlantic tropical cyclone counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Annual North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) counts are frequently modeled as a Poisson process with a state-dependent rate. We provide a lower bound on the forecasting error of this class of models. Remarkably we find that this bound is already saturated by a simple linear model that explains roughly 50 percent of the annual variance using three climate indices: El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), average sea surface temperature (SST) in the main development region (MDR) of the North Atlantic and the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) atmospheric circulation index (Kozar et al 2012). As expected under the bound, increased model complexity does not help: we demonstrate that allowing for quadratic and interaction terms, or using an Elastic Net to forecast TC counts using global SST maps, produces no detectable increase in skill. We provide evidence that observed TC counts are consistent with a Poisson process, limiting possible improvements in TC modeling by relaxing the Poisson assumption.</description>

      <title>A novel stacked hybrid autoencoder for imputing LISA data gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will contain gaps with missing or unusable data due to antenna repointing, orbital corrections, instrument malfunctions, and unknown random processes. We introduce a new deep learning model to impute data gaps in the LISA data stream. The stacked hybrid autoencoder combines a denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) with a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). The DCAE is used to extract relevant features in the corrupted data, while the BiGRU captures the temporal dynamics of the gravitational-wave signals. We show for a massive black hole binary signal, corrupted by data gaps of various numbers and duration, that we yield an overlap of greater than 99.97% when the gaps do not occur in the merging phase and greater than 99% when the gaps do occur in the merging phase. However, if data gaps occur during merger time, we show that we get biased astrophysical parameter estimates, highlighting the need for "protected periods," where antenna repointing does not occur during the predicted merger time.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty estimation via ensembles of deep learning models and dropout layers for seismic traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in various fields, including seismology. However, one major challenge in deep learning is the presence of mislabeled examples. Additionally, accurately estimating model uncertainty is another challenge in machine learning. In this study, we develop Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify seismic waveforms based on first-motion polarity. We trained multiple CNN models with different settings. We also constructed ensembles of networks to estimate uncertainty. The results showed that each training setting achieved satisfactory performances, with the ensemble method outperforming individual networks in uncertainty estimation. We observe that the uncertainty estimation ability of the ensembles of networks can be enhanced using dropout layers. In addition, comparisons among different training settings revealed that the use of dropout improved the robustness of networks to mislabeled examples.</description>

      <title>Spectral Insights and Timing Analysis of X-ray Bursts in EXO 0748-676: A NuSTAR Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the timing and spectral characteristics of X-ray bursts from the neutron star system EXO 0748-676 using the NuSTAR observatory's FPMA and FPMB instruments in the 3-79 keV range. We identify Type I X-ray bursts driven by thermonuclear explosions on the neutron star's surface, notably a significant burst at \(X = 18,479.97\), indicating rapid energy release, followed by a recoil burst at \(X = 19,463.97\), reflecting stabilization. The correlation between burst timing and the neutron star's optical period suggests modulation by its rotation and periodic accretion dynamics. Spectral modeling reveals a photon index of \( \Gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.014 \) and a cutoff energy of \( E_C = 36.20 \pm 1.04 \; \text{keV} \), indicating a hot corona around the neutron star. The measured flux of approximately \( (381.17 \pm 0.014) \times 10^{-12} \; \text{erg cm}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1} \) underscores the dynamic nature of accretion-driven systems. Calculated luminosities derived from distance estimates range from \( (3.86 \pm 0.239) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \) to \( (2.3 \pm 0.177) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \). Comparative analysis with prior observations from the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite shows variability in emission characteristics, including softer photon indices and higher cutoff energies in 2003 and 2004. Our examination of smaller energy gaps (3-7 keV, 7-12 keV, etc.) reveals energy-dependent behavior in burst characteristics, enhancing our understanding of nuclear burning phases. Overall, these findings validate models describing Type I X-ray bursts and lay the groundwork for future investigations into similar astrophysical systems and stellar evolution processes in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of darkness using a standard single-photon avalanche photodiode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In experiments requiring extreme darkness, such as experiments probing the limits of human vision, assessment of the background photon flux is essential. However, direct measurement thereof with standard single photon detectors is challenged by dark counts and their fluctuations. Here we report an experiment and detailed statistical analysis of a direct measurement of darkness in a dedicated dark chamber suitable for human vision experiments, only using a standard single photon detector and a mechanical shutter. From a Bayesian analysis of $616$ h of data, we find substantial to decisive evidence for absolute darkness (depending on choice of prior distribution) based on the Savage-Dickey ratio, and a light level $&lt;0.039$ cnt/s (posterior $0.95$-highest density interval).</description>

      <title>Imprint of massive neutrinos on Persistent Homology of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the Persistent Homology technique and its complementary representations,
  we examine the footprint of summed neutrino mass ($M_{\nu}$) in the various density fields simulated by the publicly available Quijote suite. The evolution of topological features by utilizing the super-level filtration on three-dimensional density fields at zero redshift, reveals a remarkable benchmark for constraining the cosmological parameters, particularly $M_{\nu}$ and $\sigma_8$. The abundance of independent closed surfaces (voids) compared to the connected components (clusters) and independent loops (filaments), is more sensitive to the presence of $M_{\nu}$ for $R=5$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ irrespective of whether using the total matter density field ($m$) or CDM+baryons field ($cb$). Reducing the degeneracy between $M_{\nu}$ and $\sigma_8$ is achieved via Persistent Homology for the $m$ field but not for the $cb$ field. The uncertainty of $M_{\nu}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence interval from the joint analysis of Persistent Homology vectorization for the $m$ and $cb$ fields smoothed by $R=5$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=0$ reaches $0.0152$ eV and $0.1242$ eV, respectively. Noticing the use of the 3-dimensional underlying density field at $z=0$, the mentioned uncertainties can be treated as the theoretical lower limits.</description>
