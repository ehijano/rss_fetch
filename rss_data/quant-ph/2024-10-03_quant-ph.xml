      <title>A Few Shot Learning Scheme for Quantum Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Quantum Computation is plagued by issues that limit the implementation and development of quantum systems and quantum algorithms. Issues which force the development of Hybrid Quantum-Classical algorithms, such as the quantum DisCoCat implementation for Natural Language Processing. These require a high processing cost and are susceptible to errors due to Out of Vocabulary words. In this work, we develop a framework to implement Few Shot Learning for Quantum Natural Language Processing, by modifying the encoding ans\"atze and dividing it into two parts, the first one leveraging the vast corpus of classical training already available, and the second variationally training on the task. This framework is then put to the test to explore its behaviour and its power in extracting as much useful work from each call to a quantum system as possible.</description>

      <title>Universal bounds in quantum metrology in presence of correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive fundamental bounds for general quantum metrological models involving both temporal or spatial correlations (mathematically described by quantum combs), which may be effectively computed in the limit of a large number of probes or sensing channels involved. Although the bounds are not guaranteed to be tight in general, their tightness may be systematically increased by increasing numerical complexity of the procedure. Interestingly, this approach yields bounds tighter than the state of the art also for uncorrelated channels. We apply the bound to study the limits for the most general adaptive phase estimation models in the presence of temporally correlated dephasing. We consider dephasing both parallel (no Heisenberg scaling) and perpendicular (Heisenberg scaling possible) to the signal. In the former case our new bounds show that negative correlations are beneficial, for the latter we show evidence that the bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Matchgate hierarchy: A Clifford-like hierarchy for deterministic gate teleportation in matchgate circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Clifford hierarchy, introduced by Gottesman and Chuang in 1999, is an increasing sequence of sets of quantum gates crucial to the gate teleportation model for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Gates in the hierarchy can be deterministically implemented, with increasing complexity, via gate teleportation using (adaptive) Clifford circuits with access to magic states.
  We propose an analogous gate teleportation protocol and a related hierarchy in the context of matchgate circuits, another restricted class of quantum circuits that can be efficiently classically simulated but are promoted to quantum universality via access to `matchgate-magic' states. The protocol deterministically implements any $n$-qubit gate in the hierarchy using adaptive matchgate circuits with magic states, with the level in the hierarchy indicating the required depth of adaptivity and thus number of magic states consumed. It also provides a whole family of novel deterministic matchgate-magic states.
  We completely characterise the gates in the matchgate hierarchy for two qubits, with the consequence that, in this case, the required number of resource states grows linearly with the target gate's level in the hierarchy. For an arbitrary number of qubits, we propose a characterisation of the matchgate hierarchy by leveraging the fermionic Stone$\unicode{x2013}$von Neumann theorem. It places a polynomial upper bound on the space requirements for representing gates at each level.</description>

      <title>Estimates of loss function concentration in noisy parametrized quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum computing provides a versatile computational approach, applicable to a wide range of fields such as quantum chemistry, machine learning, and optimization problems. However, scaling up the optimization of quantum circuits encounters a significant hurdle due to the exponential concentration of the loss function, often dubbed the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon. Although rigorous results exist on the extent of barren plateaus in unitary or in noisy circuits, little is known about the interaction between these two effects, mainly because the loss concentration in noisy parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) cannot be adequately described using the standard Lie algebraic formalism used in the unitary case. In this work, we introduce a new analytical formulation based on non-negative matrix theory that enables precise calculation of the variance in deep PQCs, which allows investigating the complex and rich interplay between unitary dynamics and noise. In particular, we show the emergence of a noise-induced absorption mechanism, a phenomenon that cannot arise in the purely reversible context of unitary quantum computing. Despite the challenges, general lower bounds on the variance of deep PQCs can still be established by appropriately slowing down speed of convergence to the deep circuit limit, effectively mimicking the behaviour of shallow circuits. Our framework applies to both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, allowing us to establish a deeper connection between the noise resilience of PQCs and the potential to enhance their expressive power through smart initialization strategies. Theoretical developments are supported by numerical examples and related applications.</description>

      <title>QKD as a Quantum Machine Learning task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose considering Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols as a use case for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms. We define and investigate the QML task of optimizing eavesdropping attacks on the quantum circuit implementation of the BB84 protocol. QKD protocols are well understood and solid security proofs exist enabling an easy evaluation of the QML model performance. The power of easy-to-implement QML techniques is shown by finding the explicit circuit for optimal individual attacks in a noise-free setting. For the noisy setting we find, to the best of our knowledge, a new cloning algorithm, which can outperform known cloning methods. Finally, we present a QML construction of a collective attack by using classical information from QKD post-processing within the QML algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a mathematical derivation of a quasi-stationary model for multimode parametric down-conversion, which was presented in [Gatti et al., Sci. Rep. 13, 16786] with heuristic arguments. The model is here derived from the 3D+1 propagation equation of the quantum fields in a nonlinear crystal, and its approximations discussed thoroughly. Thanks to its relative simplicity, and to the fact that it is valid in any gain regime, both at a quantum and classical level, it allows a unified description of disparate experimental observations conducted over the last 20 years, often described in the past by means of limited ad hoc models.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Eigensolver Approach to Prime Factorization on IBM's Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical approach to prime factorization. The proposed algorithm is based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which employs a classical optimizer to find the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. A numerical study is presented, evaluating the performance of the proposed method across various instances on both IBM's real quantum computer and its classical simulator. The results demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully factorizing numbers up to 253 on a real quantum computer and up to 1048561 on a classical simulator. These findings show the potential of the approach for practical applications on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum-data-driven dynamical transition in quantum learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits are an essential ingredient of quantum information processing. Parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function -- quantum neural networks (QNNs) -- provide a paradigm for achieving quantum advantage in the near term. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance. In terms of supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression for large datasets, the role of quantum data in QNN training dynamics remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition, where the target value and data determine the polynomial or exponential convergence of the training. We analytically derive the complete classification of fixed points from the dynamical equation and reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics. These dynamics originate from a bifurcation transition with multiple codimensions induced by training data, extending the transcritical bifurcation in simple optimization tasks. Furthermore, perturbative analyses identify an exponential convergence class and a polynomial convergence class among the seven dynamics. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations of QNN training and experimental verification on IBM quantum devices. As the QNN training dynamics is determined by the choice of the target value, our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to optimize the speed of convergence.</description>

      <title>Simple Construction of Qudit Floquet Codes on a Family of Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) offer a wider possibilities in how one can protect logical quantum information from noise and perform fault-tolerant quantum computation compared to static QECCs. A family of dynamical codes called the ``Floquet codes'' consists of a periodic sequence of two-qudit measurements from which one can correct errors on many-body systems, relaxing the requirement for hardware implementations. Existing results on Floquet codes has been focused on qubits, two-level quantum systems, with very little attention given on higher dimensional quantum systems, or qudits. We bridge this gap by proposing a simple, yet general construction of qudit Floquet codes based on a simple set of conditions on the sequence two-body measurements defining the code. Moreover, this construction applies to a large family of configurations of qudits on the vertices of a three-colorable lattice which connectivity represented by the edges. We show that this construction includes the existing constructions of both qubit and qudit Floquet codes as special cases. In addition, any qudit Floquet code obtained by our construction achieves a rate of encoded logical qudits over physical qudits approaching $\frac{1}{2}$ as the number of physical qudits in total and on the faces of the lattice grows larger, as opposed to vanishing rate in existing qudit Floquet code constructions.</description>

      <title>Universal Logical Quantum Photonic Neural Network Processor via Cavity-Assisted Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information within bosonic modes offers a promising direction for hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, achieving high-fidelity universal control over the bosonic degree of freedom using native photonic hardware remains a challenge. Here, we propose an architecture to prepare and perform logical quantum operations on arbitrary multimode multi-photon states using a quantum photonic neural network. Central to our approach is the optical nonlinearity, which is realized through strong light-matter interaction with a three-level Lambda atomic system. The dynamics of this interaction are confined to the single-mode subspace, enabling the construction of high-fidelity quantum gates. This nonlinearity functions as a photon-number selective phase gate, which facilitates the construction of a universal gate set and serves as the element-wise activation function in our neural network architecture. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by executing tasks that are key to logical quantum information processing. The network is able to deterministically prepare a wide array of multimode multi-photon states, including essential resource states. We also show that the architecture is capable of encoding and performing logical operations on bosonic error-correcting codes. Additionally, by adapting components of our architecture, error-correcting circuits can be built to protect bosonic codes. The proposed architecture paves the way for near-term quantum photonic processors that enable error-corrected quantum computation, and can be achieved using present-day integrated photonic hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mutual Information in Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the quantum mutual information is a fundamental measure of quantum information, it is only defined for spacelike-separated quantum systems. Such a limitation is not present in the theory of classical information, where the mutual information between two random variables is well-defined irrespective of whether or not the variables are separated in space or separated in time. Motivated by this disparity between the classical and quantum mutual information, we employ the pseudo-density matrix formalism to define a simple extension of quantum mutual information into the time domain. As in the spatial case, we show that such a notion of quantum mutual information in time serves as a natural measure of correlation between timelike-separated systems, while also highlighting ways in which quantum correlations distinguish between space and time. We also show how such quantum mutual information is time-symmetric with respect to quantum Bayesian inversion, and then we conclude by showing how mutual information in time yields a Holevo bound for the amount of classical information that may be extracted from sequential measurements on an ensemble of quantum states.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by gauging logical operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation must be performed in a fault-tolerant manner to be realizable in practice. Recent progress has uncovered quantum error-correcting codes with sparse connectivity requirements and constant qubit overhead. Existing schemes for fault-tolerant logical measurement do not always achieve low qubit overhead. Here we present a low-overhead method to implement fault-tolerant logical measurement in a quantum error-correcting code by treating the logical operator as a symmetry and gauging it. The gauging measurement procedure introduces a high degree of flexibility that can be leveraged to achieve a qubit overhead that is linear in the weight of the operator being measured up to a polylogarithmic factor. This flexibility also allows the procedure to be adapted to arbitrary quantum codes. Our results provide a new, more efficient, approach to performing fault-tolerant quantum computation, making it more tractable for near-term implementation.</description>

      <title>The Role of piracy in quantum proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known feature of quantum information is that it cannot, in general, be cloned. Recently, a number of quantum-enabled information-processing tasks have demonstrated various forms of uncloneability; among these forms, piracy is an adversarial model that gives maximal power to the adversary, in controlling both a cloning-type attack, as well as the evaluation/verification stage. Here, we initiate the study of anti-piracy proof systems, which are proof systems that inherently prevent piracy attacks. We define anti-piracy proof systems, demonstrate such a proof system for an oracle problem, and also describe a candidate anti-piracy proof system for NP. We also study quantum proof systems that are cloneable and settle the famous QMA vs. QMA(2) debate in this setting. Lastly, we discuss how one can approach the QMA vs. QCMA question, by studying its cloneable variants.</description>

Abstract: Scaling properties inherent in quantum dynamics have been studied for various systems in terms of acceleration, deceleration and time reversing. We show a scaling property of quantum dynamics on curved space-time where gravity plays an essential role. We derive system parameters which realize speed-controlled dynamics. Moreover, we consider spatial scaling and derive system parameters which realize spatially-scaled quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Approximate Degrees of Multisymmetric Properties with Application to Quantum Claw Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The claw problem is central in the fields of theoretical computer science as well as cryptography. The optimal quantum query complexity of the problem is known to be $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ for input functions $f\colon [F]\to Z$ and $g\colon [G]\to Z$. However, the lower bound was proved when the range $Z$ is sufficiently large (i.e., $|{Z}|=\Omega(FG)$). The current paper proves the lower bound holds even for every smaller range $Z$ with $|{Z}|\ge F+G$. This implies that $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ is tight for every such range. In addition, the lower bound $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+F^{1/3}G^{1/6}M^{1/6}\right)$ is provided for even smaller range $Z=[M]$ with every $M\in [2,F+G]$ by reducing the claw problem for $|{Z}|= F+G$. The proof technique is general enough to apply to any $k$-symmetric property (e.g., the $k$-claw problem), i.e., the Boolean function $\Phi$ on the set of $k$ functions with different-size domains and a common range such that $\Phi$ is invariant under the permutations over each domain and the permutations over the range. More concretely, it generalizes Ambainis's argument [Theory of Computing, 1(1):37-46] to the multiple-function case by using the notion of multisymmetric polynomials.</description>

      <title>Improved quantum algorithm for calculating eigenvalues of differential operators and its application to estimating the decay rate of the perturbation distribution tail in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for scientific computing and their applications have been studied actively. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for estimating the first eigenvalue of a differential operator $\mathcal{L}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and its application to cosmic inflation theory. A common approach for this eigenvalue problem involves applying the finite-difference discretization to $\mathcal{L}$ and computing the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix, but this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, namely the exponential complexity with respect to $d$. Our first contribution is the development of a new quantum algorithm for this task, leveraging recent quantum singular value transformation-based methods. Given a trial function that overlaps well with the eigenfunction, our method runs with query complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ with $d$ and estimation accuracy $\epsilon$, which is polynomial in $d$ and shows an improvement over existing quantum algorithms. Then, we consider the application of our method to a problem in a theoretical framework for cosmic inflation known as stochastic inflation, specifically calculating the eigenvalue of the adjoint Fokker--Planck operator, which is related to the decay rate of the tail of the probability distribution for the primordial density perturbation. We numerically see that in some cases, simple trial functions overlap well with the first eigenfunction, indicating our method is promising for this problem.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusive dynamics in photonic random walks probed with classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random walk of photons in a tight-binding lattice is known to exhibit diffusive motion similar to classical random walks under decoherence, clearly illustrating the quantum-to-classical transition. In this study, we reveal that the random walk of intense classical light under dephasing dynamics can disentangle quantum and ensemble averaging, making it possible to observe a subdiffusive walker dynamics, i.e. a behavior very distinct from both a classical and a quantum walker. These findings are demonstrated through proposing photonic random walks in synthetic temporal lattices, based on pulse dynamics in coupled fiber loops.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time constructive decision algorithm for multivariable quantum signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) have provided a unified framework for understanding many quantum algorithms, including factorization, matrix inversion, and Hamiltonian simulation. As a multivariable version of QSP, multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP) is proposed. M-QSP interleaves signal operators corresponding to each variable with signal processing operators, which provides an efficient means to perform multivariable polynomial transformations. However, the necessary and sufficient condition for what types of polynomials can be constructed by M-QSP is unknown. In this paper, we propose a classical algorithm to determine whether a given pair of multivariable Laurent polynomials can be implemented by M-QSP, which returns True or False. As one of the most important properties of this algorithm, it returning True is the necessary and sufficient condition. The proposed classical algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of variables and signal operators. Our algorithm also provides a constructive method to select the necessary parameters for implementing M-QSP. These findings offer valuable insights for identifying practical applications of M-QSP.</description>

      <title>Atoms near a conducting wedge: decay rates and entanglement around a corner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of an atomic system is influenced by introducing a metallic surface. This work explores how the decay landscape can be altered by the presence of sharp corners. We examine two scenarios: the modified spontaneous decay of a single atom, which leads us to speculate about potential applications in microscopy, and the case of a more fundamental, theoretical interest - the behavior of an entangled pair of atoms near a corner. The latter, when two atoms are positioned ``out of the line of sight'' opens up a possible line of investigation into devices which are able to ``see around corners''.</description>

      <title>Is a particle an irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The claim that a particle is an irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group -- what I call \emph{Wigner's identification} -- is now, decades on from Wigner's (1939) original paper, so much a part of particle physics folklore that it is often taken as, or claimed to be, a definition. My aims in this paper are to: (i) clarify, and partially defend, the guiding ideas behind this identification; (ii) raise objections to its being an adequate definition; and (iii) offer a rival characterisation of particles. My main objections to Wigner's identification appeal to the problem of interacting particles, and to alternative spacetimes. I argue that the link implied in Wigner's identification, between a spacetime's symmetries and the generator of a particle's space of states, is at best misleading, and that there is no good reason to link the generator of a particle's space of states to symmetries of any kind. I propose an alternative characterisation of particles, which captures both the relativistic and non-relativistic setting. I further defend this proposal by appeal to a theorem which links the decomposition of Poincar\'e generators into purely orbital and spin components with canonical algebraic relations between position, momentum and spin.</description>

      <title>Competing automorphisms and disordered Floquet codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study deformed Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution$\unicode{x2014}$the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition on Abelian-anyon FETs, showing how the evolution and loss of logical information are linked to the anyons that are invariant under the automorphisms' transition map or that localize at their boundaries. We present an example microscopic realization of this behavior using disorder in the dynamic automorphism color code. This naturally leads to a description of the space of its FETs, which we characterize by establishing when parameter-space paths connecting distinct FETs can preserve logical information. We also show that transitions between distinct FETs display criticality described by bond percolation. The perspective of competing automorphisms captures essential features of possible FETs and their transitions, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and disorder.</description>

      <title>Qudit-based quantum error-correcting codes from irreducible representations of SU(d)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudits naturally correspond to multi-level quantum systems, which offer an efficient route towards quantum information processing, but their reliability is contingent upon quantum error correction capabilities. In this paper, we present a general procedure for constructing error-correcting qudit codes through the irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ for any odd integer $d \geq 3.$ Using the Weyl character formula and inner product of characters, we deduce the relevant branching rules, through which we identify the physical Hilbert spaces that contain valid code spaces. We then discuss how two forms of permutation invariance and the Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry of $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ can be exploited to simplify the construction of error-correcting codes. Finally, we use our procedure to construct an infinite class of error-correcting codes encoding a logical qudit into $(d-1)^2$ physical qudits.</description>

      <title>Optimised Hybrid Classical-Quantum Algorithm for Accelerated Solution of Sparse Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently solving large-scale sparse linear systems poses a significant challenge in computational science, especially in fields such as physics, engineering, machine learning, and finance. Traditional classical algorithms face scalability issues as the size of these systems increases, leading to performance degradation. On the other hand, quantum algorithms, like the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, offer exponential speedups for solving linear systems, yet they are constrained by the current state of quantum hardware and sensitivity to matrix condition numbers. This paper introduces a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm that combines CUDA-accelerated preconditioning techniques with the HHL algorithm to solve sparse linear systems more efficiently. The classical GPU parallelism is utilised to preprocess and precondition the matrix, reducing its condition number, while quantum computing is employed to solve the preconditioned system using the HHL algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm integrates machine learning models, particularly reinforcement learning, to dynamically optimise system parameters, such as block sizes and preconditioning stratgies, based on real-time performance data. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach not only surpasses traditional methods in speed and scalability but also mitigates some of the inherent limitations of quantum algorithms. This work pushes the boundaries of efficient computing and provides a foundation for future advancements in hybrid computational frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use digital quantum computing to simulate the creation of particles in a dynamic spacetime. We consider a system consisting of a minimally coupled massive quantum scalar field in a spacetime undergoing homogeneous and isotropic expansion, transitioning from one stationary state to another through a brief inflationary period. We simulate two vibration modes, positive and negative for a given field momentum, by devising a quantum circuit that implements the time evolution. With this circuit, we study the number of particles created after the universe expands at a given rate, both by simulating the circuit and by actual experimental implementation on IBM quantum computers, consisting of hundreds of quantum gates. We find that state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques are useful to improve the estimation of the number of particles and the fidelity of the state.</description>

      <title>Quasi Inverse of Qubit Channels for Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We found the quasi inverse of qubit channels as a unitary map, $\mathcal{E}^i$, by minimizing the average trace distance between the input state to the channel and the output of the quasi inverse channel for arbitrary qubit channel $\mathcal{E}$ and for arbitrary input states. The channel $\mathcal{E}$ was assumed completely positive and trace-preserving. To find the quasi inverse for mixed states, we proposed an alternative definition of the quasi inverse based on the mean square of the trace distance (MSTD) of the mixed input state of the original channel and the output of the quasi inverse. The definition based on the trace distance allowed easy generalization of the quasi inverse to mixed input states. The quasi inverse of the Pauli, generalized amplitude damping, mixed unitary, and tetrahedron channels calculated based on trace distance agreed with the one computed using fidelity in the special case of input states being pure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Digital Health? A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the digitization of health data, the growth of electronic health and medical records lowers barriers for using algorithmic techniques for data analysis. While classical machine learning techniques for health data approach commercialization, there is not yet clear evidence whether quantum machine learning (QML) will provide any empirical advantage for digital health data processing. In this systematic literature review we assess whether QML algorithms have the potential to outperform existing classical methods in efficacy or efficiency. We include digital electronic health/medical records (EH/MRs) and data considered to be a reasonable proxy to EH/MRs. Eligible QML algorithms must be designed for quantum computing hardware, as opposed to quantum-inspired techniques. PubMed, Embase, IEEE, Scopus and arXiv yielded 4915 studies between 2015 to 10 June 2024. After screening 169 eligible studies, most studies contained widespread technical misconceptions about QML and we excluded 123 studies for insufficient rigor in analysis. Of the remaining 46 studies, only 16 studies consider realistic QML operating conditions, either by testing algorithms on quantum hardware, or using noisy quantum circuits when assessing QML algorithms. We find QML applications in digital health focus primarily on clinical decision support rather than health service delivery or public health. Nearly all QML models are linear quantum models, and therefore represent a subset of general quantum algorithms. Meanwhile, novel data-encoding strategies do not address scalability issues, except in regimes requiring restrictive assumptions about quantum hardware, rendering these protocols inefficient for the general encoding of large health datasets. By establishing the current state of evidence for QML-based health applications, we pave the way for meaningful dialogue about QML use-case discovery in digital health.</description>

      <title>Motion-Insensitive Time-Optimal Control of Optical Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In trapped-atom quantum computers, high-fidelity control of optical qubits is challenging due to the motion of atoms in the trap. If not corrected, the atom motion gets entangled with the qubit degrees of freedom through two fundamental mechanisms, (i) photon recoil and (ii) thermal motion, both leading to a reduction of the gate fidelity. We develop motion-insensitive pulses that suppress both sources of infidelity by modulating the phase of the driving laser field in time. To eliminate photon recoil, we use bang-bang pulses$-$derived using time-optimal control$-$which shorten the gate duration by about 20 times compared to conventional pulses. However, even when photon recoil is eliminated, we find that the gate error does not vanish, but is rather limited by a bound arising from thermal motion-induced entanglement. Remarkably, this bound is independent of the Rabi frequency, meaning that, unlike for photon recoil, operating in the resolved sideband regime does not mitigate this source of infidelity. To overcome this bound, we derive smooth-phase pulses, which allow for a further reduction of the gate error by more than an order of magnitude for typical thermal atoms. Motion-insensitive pulses can be refined to compensate for laser inhomogeneities, enhancing the gate performance in practical situations. Our results are validated through simulations of one-qubit gates operating on the optical clock transition of ${}^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in an optical tweezers array.</description>

      <title>Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through a first-order quantum phase transition. Specifically, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging, necessitating high-order nonlocal terms in the expansion. Our results demonstrate that local CD strategies have limited effectiveness when crossing the extremely small gaps characteristic of NP-hard Ising problems. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which significantly increases the fidelity to the target state over the expansion method by directly addressing the gap-closing point and the associated edge states.</description>

      <title>Extra cost of erasure due to quantum lifetime broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing a bit of information was fundamentally lower bounded by Landauer, in terms of the temperature of its environment: $W\geq k_\mathrm{B} T \ln 2$. However, in real electronic devices, the information-bearing system is usually in contact with two or more electrodes, with different temperatures and chemical potentials. It is not clear what sets the cost of erasure in such nonequilibrium situations. One promising technology for testing the thermodynamic limits of information processing is quantum dots, in which a bit is encoded in the presence or absence of a single electron. We here develop a thermodynamic description of devices of this type and find that, in addition to the electrode temperatures, the potential difference across the quantum dot and lifetime broadening of its energy level contribute to the minimum work cost of erasure. In practical contexts, these contributions may significantly outweigh the cost due to temperature alone.</description>

      <title>Personalized Quantum Federated Learning for Privacy Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning has brought about the improvement of privacy image classification, while the lack of personality of the client model may contribute to the suboptimal of quantum federated learning. A personalized quantum federated learning algorithm for privacy image classification is proposed to enhance the personality of the client model in the case of an imbalanced distribution of images. First, a personalized quantum federated learning model is constructed, in which a personalized layer is set for the client model to maintain the personalized parameters. Second, a personalized quantum federated learning algorithm is introduced to secure the information exchanged between the client and server.Third, the personalized federated learning is applied to image classification on the FashionMNIST dataset, and the experimental results indicate that the personalized quantum federated learning algorithm can obtain global and local models with excellent performance, even in situations where local training samples are imbalanced. The server's accuracy is 100% with 8 clients and a distribution parameter of 100, outperforming the non-personalized model by 7%. The average client accuracy is 2.9% higher than that of the non-personalized model with 2 clients and a distribution parameter of 1. Compared to previous quantum federated learning algorithms, the proposed personalized quantum federated learning algorithm eliminates the need for additional local training while safeguarding both model and data privacy.It may facilitate broader adoption and application of quantum technologies, and pave the way for more secure, scalable, and efficient quantum distribute machine learning solutions.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite relaxations for high-dimensional entanglement in the steering scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce semidefinite programming hierarchies for benchmarking high-dimensional entanglement in the one-sided device-independent experiments corresponding to the steering scenario. Firstly, we provide a general method for detecting the entanglement dimensionality of the source through certification of its Schmidt number. Its key feature is that the computational cost is independent of the Schmidt number under consideration. Secondly, we provide a method to bound the fidelity of the source with any maximally entangled state in any given dimension. This enables experimentally natural entanglement quantification in the steering scenario. Using only basic computational means, we demonstrate the usefulness of these methods in several case studies.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices. A recent study has proved that, with Haar random projective measurements, only a $O(n^3)$ number of state copies is required to guarantee bounded recovery error of an matrix product operator (MPO) state of qubits $n$. While this result provides a formal evidence that quantum states with an efficient classical representation can be reconstructed with an efficient number of state copies, the number of state copies required is still significantly larger than the number of independent parameters in the classical representation.
  In this paper, we attempt to narrow this gap and study whether the number of state copies can saturate the information theoretic bound (i.e., $O(n)$, the number of parameters in the MPOs) using physical quantum measurements. We answer this question affirmatively by using a class of Informationally Complete Positive Operator-Valued Measures (IC-POVMs), including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\ge3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is needed for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO. Moreover, we propose a projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm to solve the constrained least-squares problem and show that it can efficiently find an estimate with bounded recovery error when appropriately initialized.</description>

      <title>Chaitin Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of Hamiltonians whose phase diagram is guaranteed to have a single phase transition, yet the location of this phase transition is uncomputable. The Hamiltonians $H(\phi)$ describe qudits on a two-dimensional square lattice with translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour interactions tuned by a continuous parameter $\phi\in(0,1]$. For all $\phi\in(0,1]$, $H(\phi)$ is in one of two phases, one a gapless phase, the other a gapped phase. The phase transition occurs when $\phi$ equals the Chaitin's constant $\Omega$, a well-defined real number that encodes the Halting problem, and hence is uncomputable for Turing machines and undecidable for any consistent recursive axiomatization of mathematics. Our result implies that no general algorithm exists to determine the phase diagrams even under the promise that the phase diagram is exceedingly simple, and illustrates how uncomputable numbers may manifest in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Variational Graphical Quantum Error Correction Codes: adjustable codes from topological insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage the insights from Quon, a picture language for quantum information, to develop a new class of quantum error-correcting codes termed Variational Graphical Quantum Error Correction~(VGQEC) codes. The VGQEC codes feature adjustable configuration parameters that play a pivotal role in determining the error-correcting capability of the codes. This key feature offers remarkable flexibility in customizing high-quality quantum error-correcting codes for various noise models. For instance, we will present a specific VGQEC code that exhibits a seamless transition of parameters, enabling the smooth transformation of the code from the five-qubit repetition code to the [[5,1,3]] code, and furthermore, the new VGQEC code has a better performance than the above two well-known codes under certain noise models. Meanwhile, we also propose a general physical scheme to implement and optimize VGQEC codes in realistic quantum devices. Lastly, we apply our approach to amplitude damping noise, and by numerical calculations, we discover an unexpected novel three-qubit code that can effectively mitigate the noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage and lower bounds in parallel query complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that quantum, randomized and deterministic (sequential) query complexities are polynomially related for total boolean functions. We find that significantly larger separations between the parallel generalizations of these measures are possible. In particular,
  (1) We employ the cheatsheet framework to obtain an unbounded parallel quantum query advantage over its randomized analogue for a total function, falsifying a conjecture of Jeffery et al. 2017 (arXiv:1309.6116).
  (2) We strengthen (1) by constructing a total function which exhibits an unbounded parallel quantum query advantage despite having no sequential advantage, suggesting that genuine quantum advantage could occur entirely due to parallelism.
  (3) We construct a total function that exhibits a polynomial separation between 2-round quantum and randomized query complexities, contrasting a result of Montanaro in 2010 (arXiv:1001.0018) that there is at most a constant separation for 1-round (nonadaptive) algorithms.
  (4) We develop a new technique for deriving parallel quantum lower bounds from sequential upper bounds. We employ this technique to give lower bounds for Boolean symmetric functions and read-once formulas, ruling out large parallel query advantages for them.
  We also provide separations between randomized and deterministic parallel query complexities analogous to items (1)-(3).</description>

      <title>Optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using techniques proposed in [Sason, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 59, 7118 (2013)] and [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)], and building on results from the latter, we construct a globally optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints imposed by arbitrary Hamiltonians, satisfying the Gibbs hypothesis. In particular, this provides a precise expression for the modulus of continuity of the von Neumann entropy over the set of states with bounded energy for infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Thus, it completely solves the problem of finding an optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in this setting, which was previously known only for pairs of states which were sufficiently close to each other. This continuity bound follows from a globally optimal semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under general energy constraints, which is our main technical result.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous photon and phonon lasing in a two-tone driven optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving simultaneous lasing of photons and phonons in optomechanical setups has great potential for applications in quantum information processing, high precision sensing and the design of hybrid photonic-phononic devices. Here, we explore this possibility with an optomechanical system driven by a two-tone field. Whenever the difference between the driving frequencies matches the associated mechanical frequency, the photon and phonon populations are found to achieve steady-state coherent oscillations, demonstrating a dual lasing phenomenon. Such drive-tone resonance condition can synchronize the phases of the photon and phonon fields, which facilitates a robust simultaneous lasing. Here, we provide analytical insights into the joint amplification of the optical and mechanical modes, and further confirm the dual lasing phenomenon by numerically calculating the relevant correlation functions and the power spectrum. Our setup, consisting of a single optomechanical cavity, is simpler than previous realizations of dual lasing and provides a clean picture of the underlying mechanisms. Our work thus paves the way for the development of novel strategies for the optimisation of optomechanical interactions through tailored driving schemes.</description>

      <title>Duality between string and computational order in symmetry-enriched topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first examples of topological phases of matter with uniform power for measurement-based quantum computation. This is possible thanks to a new framework for analyzing the computational properties of phases of matter that is more general than previous constructions, which were limited to short-range entangled phases in one dimension. We show that ground states of the toric code in an anisotropic magnetic field yield a natural, albeit non-computationally-universal, application of our framework. We then present a new model with topological order whose ground states are universal resources for MBQC. Both topological models are enriched by subsystem symmetries, and these symmetries protect their computational power. Our framework greatly expands the range of physical models that can be analyzed from the computational perspective.</description>

      <title>A Photonic Parameter-shift Rule: Enabling Gradient Computation for Photonic Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for gradient computation in quantum algorithms implemented on linear optical quantum computing platforms. While parameter-shift rules have become a staple in qubit gate-based quantum computing for calculating gradients, their direct application to photonic platforms has been hindered by the non-unitary nature of differentiated phase-shift operators in Fock space. We introduce a photonic parameter-shift rule that overcomes this limitation, providing an exact formula for gradient computation in linear optical quantum processors. Our method scales linearly with the number of input photons and utilizes the same parameterized photonic circuit with shifted parameters for each evaluation. This advancement bridges a crucial gap in photonic quantum computing, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization for variational quantum algorithms on near-term photonic quantum processors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical simulations in quantum chemistry and generative modeling tasks, showing superior optimization performance as well as robustness to noise from finite sampling and photon distinguishability compared to other gradient-based and gradient-free methods.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant logical measurements via homological measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce homological measurement, a framework for measuring the logical Pauli operators encoded in CSS stabilizer codes. The framework is based on the algebraic description of such codes as chain complexes. Protocols such as lattice surgery some of its recent generalizations are shown to be special cases of homological measurement. Using this framework, we develop a specific protocol called edge expanded homological measurement for fault-tolerant measurement of arbitrary logical Pauli operators of general qLDPC codes, requiring a number of ancillary qubits growing only linearly with the weight of the logical operator measured, and guaranteed that the distance of the code is preserved. We further benchmark our protocol numerically in a photonic architecture based on GKP qubits, showing that the logical error rate of various codes are on par with other methods requiring more ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity and symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz reciprocity is a fundamental property in electromagnetism and well known to break down due to an external magnetic field. With a fictitious or imaginary vector potential, however, its behavior is largely unknown. Here we show that in systems with an imaginary vector potential and displaying the non-Hermitian skin effect, the Lorentz reciprocity is broken but still governed by a rigorous mathematical relation, which we term non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity. When mimicking an imaginary vector potential using just linear integrated photonic elements, however, the conditions that lead to the Lorentz reciprocity are still satisfied and hence the latter cannot be broken. Nevertheless, we show that the non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity can still be observed with a proper choice of inputs and outputs, alongside the Lorentz reciprocity. In addition, we also reveal another equal-amplitude response in the same system, which we attribute to a non-Hermitian gauged symmetry. Furthermore, we show that light propagation is not impinged by the non-Hermitian topological funnel effect, highlighting an underappreciated difference between coherently driven and non-driven systems. These findings are confirmed using a tight-binding model and full-wave simulations of coupled optical micro-ring resonators, providing a valuable extension of the Lorentz reciprocity in the non-Hermitian domain.</description>

Abstract: We define an index for invertible phases of two-dimensional fermionic and bosonic quantum spin systems without any additional symmetry. Conjecturally, it provides a microscopic definition of an invariant related to the chiral central charge of the boundary modes $c_- \bmod 24$ when the effective conformal field theory description is valid. Using this index, we prove that free fermionic systems with Chern number $\nu \bmod 48 \neq 0$ are in a non-trivial invertible phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a red-hot field that brings novel discoveries and exciting opportunities to resolve, speed up, or refine the analysis of a wide range of computational problems. In the realm of biomedical research and personalized medicine, the significance of multi-omics integration lies in its ability to provide a thorough and holistic comprehension of complex biological systems. This technology links fundamental research to clinical practice. The insights gained from integrated omics data can be translated into clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The fusion of quantum computing and machine learning holds promise for unraveling complex patterns within multi-omics datasets, providing unprecedented insights into the molecular landscape of lung cancer. Due to the heterogeneity, complexity, and high dimensionality of multi-omic cancer data, characterized by the vast number of features (such as gene expression, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation) relative to the limited number of lung cancer patient samples, our prime motivation for this paper is the integration of multi-omic data, unique feature selection, and diagnostic classification of lung subtypes: lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC-I) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-II) using quantum machine learning. We developed a method for finding the best differentiating features between LUAD and LUSC datasets, which has the potential for biomarker discovery.</description>

Abstract: We show that if a topological insulator is truncated along a curve that separates the plane in two sufficiently large regions, then the edge system admits absolutely continuous spectrum. Our approach combines a recent version of the bulk-edge correspondence along curves that separates geometry and intrinsic conductance [DZ24], with a result about absolutely continuous spectrum for straight edges [BW22].</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body solver using artificial neural networks and its applications to strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the feasibility of cooling of classical motion of a micro- to nano-sized magnetic particle, levitated inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The cooling action is implemented by means of controlling the phase of one of the counter-propagating fiber guided waves. Direct imaging of the particle's position, followed by the subsequent updating of the control laser's phase leads to Stokes type of cooling force. We provide estimates of cooling efficiency and final achievable temperature, taking into account thermal and detection noise sources. Our results bring forward an important step towards using trapped micro-magnets in sensing, testing the fundamental physics and preparing the quantum states of magnetization.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks contribute significantly to developing quantum algorithms and quantum simulations. Here, we introduce a first of its kind one-dimensional quantum walk in the $d$-dimensional quantum domain, where $d&gt;2$, and show its equivalence for circuit realization in an arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum logic for utilizing the advantage of larger state space, which helps to reduce the run-time of the quantum walks as compared to the conventional binary quantum systems. We provide efficient quantum circuits for the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) in one-dimensional position space in any finite-dimensional quantum system when the dimension is odd using an appropriate logical mapping of the position space on which a walker evolves onto the multi-qudit states. With example circuits for various qudit state spaces, we also explore scalability in terms of $n$-qudit $d$-ary quantum systems. Further, the extension of one-dimensional DTQW to $d$-dimensional DTQW using $2d$-dimensional coin space on $d$-dimensional lattice has been studied, where $d&gt;=2$. Thereafter, the circuit design for the implementation of scalable $d$-dimensional DTQW in $d$-ary quantum systems has been portrayed. Lastly, we exhibit the circuit design for the implementation of DTQW using different coins on various search spaces.</description>

      <title>On the feasibility of performing quantum chemistry calculations on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is envisioned as an early and disruptive application for quantum computers. Yet, closer scrutiny of the proposed algorithms shows that there are considerable difficulties along the way. Here, we propose two criteria for evaluating two leading quantum approaches for finding the ground state of molecules. The first criterion applies to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. It sets an upper bound to the level of imprecision/decoherence that can be tolerated in quantum hardware as a function of the targeted precision, the number of gates and the typical energy contribution from states populated by decoherence processes. We find that decoherence is highly detrimental to the accuracy of VQE and performing relevant chemistry calculations would require performances that are expected for fault-tolerant quantum computers, not mere noisy hardware, even with advanced error mitigation techniques. Physically, the sensitivity of VQE to decoherence originates from the fact that, in VQE, the spectrum of the studied molecule has no correlation with the spectrum of the quantum hardware used to perform the computation.
  The second criterion applies to the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, which is often presented as the go-to replacement of VQE upon availability of (noiseless) fault-tolerant quantum computers. QPE requires an input state with a large enough overlap with the sought-after ground state. We provide a criterion to estimate quantitatively this overlap based on the energy and the energy variance of said input state. Using input states from a variety of state-of-the-art classical methods, we show that the scaling of this overlap with system size does display the standard orthogonality catastrophe, namely an exponential suppression with system size. This in turns leads to an exponentially reduced QPE success probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report feedback cooling of translational and librational degrees of freedom of a levitated micromagnet cylinder, utilizing a piezoelectric actuator to apply linear feedback to high-Q mechanical modes. The normal modes are measured with a superconducting pick-up coil coupled to a DC SQUID, and phase information is fed back to the piezoelectric actuator to feedback cool a center-of-mass mode to $\sim$7 K, and a librational mode to $830 \pm 200$ mK. Q-factors of $1.0 \times 10^7$ are evaluated for the center-of-mass mode. We find that it is plausible to achieve ground state cooling of the center-of-mass mode by introducing vibration isolation, optimizing the geometry of the pick-up coil to focus on the specific mode of interest and utilizing a state-of-the-art SQUID for detection.</description>

Abstract: We numerically explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Adopting quadratic fermionic models on Sierpinski carpet, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic correction for area law in the scaling of entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, different from the fractal structure of the lattice, we observe the emergence of a novel self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Meanwhile, as the direct consequence of the entanglement fractal and beyond a single scaling behavior of entanglement contour in translation-invariant systems, we identify two distinct scaling behaviors in the entanglement contour of fractal systems. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Zeno Dragging for Quantum Control: A Shortcut to Zeno with Action-based Scheduling Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect asserts that quantum measurements inhibit simultaneous unitary dynamics when the "collapse" events are sufficiently strong and frequent. This applies in the limit of strong continuous measurement or dissipation. It is possible to implement a dissipative control that is known as "Zeno Dragging", by dynamically varying the monitored observable, and hence also the eigenstates which are attractors under Zeno dynamics. This is similar to adiabatic processes, in that the Zeno dragging fidelity is highest when the rate of eigenstate change is slow compared to the measurement rate. We demonstrate here two theoretical methods for using such dynamics to achieve control of quantum systems. The first, which we shall refer to as "shortcut to Zeno" (STZ), is analogous to the shortcuts to adiabaticity (counterdiabatic driving) that are frequently used to accelerate unitary adiabatic evolution. In the second approach we apply the Chantasri Dressel Jordan (2013, CDJ) stochastic action, and demonstrate that the extremal-probability readout paths derived from this are well suited to setting up a Pontryagin-style optimization of the Zeno dragging schedule. A fundamental contribution of the latter approach is to show that an action suitable for measurement-driven control optimization can be derived quite generally from statistical arguments. Implementing these methods on the Zeno dragging of a qubit, we find that both approaches yield the same solution, namely, that the optimal control is a unitary that matches the motion of the Zeno-monitored eigenstate. We then show that such a solution can be more robust than a unitary-only operation, and comment on solvable generalizations of our qubit example embedded in larger systems. These methods open up new pathways toward systematically developing dynamic control of Zeno subspaces to realize dissipatively-stabilized quantum operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Approximation Ratios for Warm-Started QAOA on 3-Regular Max-Cut Instances at Depth $p=1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Farhi et al.'s 0.6924-approximation result technique of the Max-Cut Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on 3-regular graphs to obtain provable lower bounds on the approximation ratio for warm-started QAOA. Given an initialization angle $\theta$, we consider warm-starts where the initial state is a product state where each qubit position is angle $\theta$ away from either the north or south pole of the Bloch sphere; of the two possible qubit positions the position of each qubit is decided by some classically obtained cut encoded as a bitstring $b$.
  We illustrate through plots how the properties of $b$ and the initialization angle $\theta$ influence the bound on the approximation ratios of warm-started QAOA. We consider various classical algorithms (and the cuts they produce which we use to generate the warm-start). Our results strongly suggest that there does not exist any choice of initialization angle that yields a (worst-case) approximation ratio that simultaneously beats standard QAOA and the classical algorithm used to create the warm-start.
  Additionally, we show that at $\theta=60^\circ$, warm-started QAOA is able to (effectively) recover the cut used to generate the warm-start, thus suggesting that in practice, this value could be a promising starting angle to explore alternate solutions in a heuristic fashion.</description>

Abstract: With recent experimental advancements demonstrating high-fidelity universal logic gates and basic programmability, Silicon-based spin quantum bit (qubit) have emerged as promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. However, implementation of more complex quantum information protocols with many qubits still remains a critical challenge for realization of practical programmability in Silicon devices. In this study, we present a computational investigation of entanglement-based quantum information applications implemented on an electrically defined quantum dot structure in Silicon. Using in-house multi-scale simulations based on tight-binding calculations augmented with bulk physics, we model a five quantum dot system that can create up to five electron spin qubits, and discuss details of control engineering needed to implement single-qubit rotations and two-qubit logic operations in a programmable manner. Using these elementary operations, then, we design a five-qubit quantum teleportation protocol and computationally verify its end-to-end operation including a simple but clear analysis on how the designed circuit can be affected by charge noise. With engineering details that are not well uncovered by experiments, our results demonstrate the advanced programmability of Silicon quantum dot systems, delivering the practical guidelines for potential designs of quantum information processes based on electrically defined Silicon quantum dot structures.</description>

Abstract: Lindblad dynamics and other open-system dynamics provide a promising path towards efficient Gibbs sampling on quantum computers. In these proposals, the Lindbladian is obtained via an algorithmic construction akin to designing an artificial thermostat in classical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods, rather than treated as an approximation to weakly coupled system-bath unitary dynamics. Recently, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en (arXiv:2311.09207) introduced the first efficiently implementable Lindbladian satisfying the Kubo--Martin--Schwinger (KMS) detailed balance condition, which ensures that the Gibbs state is a fixed point of the dynamics and is applicable to non-commuting Hamiltonians. This Gibbs sampler uses a continuously parameterized set of jump operators, and the energy resolution required for implementing each jump operator depends only logarithmically on the precision and the mixing time. In this work, we build upon the structural characterization of KMS detailed balanced Lindbladians by Fagnola and Umanit\`a, and develop a family of efficient quantum Gibbs samplers using a finite set of jump operators (the number can be as few as one), \re{akin to the classical Markov chain-based sampling algorithm. Compared to the existing works, our quantum Gibbs samplers have a comparable quantum simulation cost but with greater design flexibility and a much simpler implementation and error analysis.} Moreover, it encompasses the construction of Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en as a special instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a new constructive procedure to rapidly generate ensembles of phase-covariant dynamical maps that may be associated to the individual spins of a closed quantum system. We do this by first computing the single-spin dynamical maps in small XXZ networks and chains, specialized to the class of initial states that guarantees phase-covariant dynamics for each spin. Since the dynamics in any small, closed system contains oscillatory features associated to the system size, we define an averaging procedure to extract time-homogeneous dynamics. We use the the average map and the set of deviations from the average map in the exactly derived ensembles to motivate the form of distributional functions for map parameters. The distributions then straightforwardly generate arbitrary-sized ensembles of channels, constrained by a few global properties. This procedure can also generate ensembles where individual maps are not phase-covariant although the average map is, corresponding to realizations of disordered, or noisy, Hamiltonians. The construction procedure suggests new ways to realize random families of open-system dynamics, subject to constraints that require the ensemble to approximate a partition of a closed system.</description>

Abstract: The competition between scrambling and projective measurements can lead to measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIPT). In this work, we show that the universality class of the MIPT is drastically altered when the system is coupled to a diffusing conserved density. Specifically, we consider a 1+1d random Clifford circuit locally monitored by classically diffusing particles (``measurers''). The resulting diffusive correlations in the measurement density are a relevant perturbation to the usual space-time random MIPT critical point, producing a new universality class for this phase transition. We find ``Griffiths-like'' effects due to rare space-time regions where, e.g., the diffusive measurers have a low or high density, but these are considerably weaker than the Griffiths effects that occur with quenched randomness that produce rare spatial regions with infinite lifetime.</description>

Abstract: Our study explores multipartite nonlocality by extending $2$-player nonlocal games to multiplayer games, where the players are positioned across the vertices of a graph. We characterize when $2$-player games cannot violate Bell nonlocality on graphs with more than $2$ vertices. Using similar techniques, we show the CHSH game only exhibits nonlocality in two distributed scenarios: the original 2-player game and the 4-player game on the path graph. In contrast, several other well-studied games have no such violations on larger graphs. Lastly, we provide a $2$-player game that exhibits nonlocality on infinitely many graphs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying nonclassicality of mixed Fock states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of bosonic modes are important resources for quantum-enhanced technologies. Yet, quantifying nonclassicality of these states, in particular mixed states, can be a challenge. Here we present results of quantifying the nonclassicality of a bosonic mode in a mixed Fock state via the operational resource theory (ORT) measure [W. Ge, K. Jacobs, S. Asiri, M. Foss-Feig, and M. S. Zubairy, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023400 (2020)], which relates nonclassicality to metrological advantage. Generally speaking, evaluating a resource-theoretic measure for mixed states is challenging, since it involves finding a convex roof. However, we show that our problem can be reduced to a linear programming problem. By analyzing the results of numerical optimization, we are able to extract analytical results for the case where three or four neighboring Fock states have nonzero population. Interestingly, we find that such a mode can be in distinct phases, depending on the populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how our method is generalizable to density matrices of higher ranks. Our findings suggest a viable method for evaluating nonclassicality of arbitrary mixed bosonic states and potentially for solving other convex roof optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Conventional Quantum Theory Does Not Support A Coherent Relational Account</title>

Abstract: Quantum theory in its conventional formulation is notoriously subject to various measurement-related paradoxes, as exemplified by the "Schrodinger's Cat" and "Wigner's Friend" thought experiments. It has been shown, for example by Frauchiger and Renner, that nested measurements such as those occurring in the Wigner's Friend experiment can lead to inconsistencies concerning the putative outcomes of measurements. Such inconsistencies are commonly presumed to remain private and incommensurable, but this is not the case. A counterexample, in which the inconsistencies can be revealed among the observers, is reviewed. The implications for a recent attempt to shield Relational Quantum Mechanics from such inconsistencies are considered, and it is concluded that the attempt is not successful. Further implications for the state of the debate concerning the viability of quantum theory in its various formulations are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We describe a novel class of quantum mechanical particle oscillations in both relativistic and non-relativistic systems based on $PT$ symmetry and $T^2=-1$ (relevant for fermions), where $P$ is parity and $T$ is time reversal. The Hamiltonians are chosen at the outset to be self-adjoint with respect to a PT inner product. The quantum mechanical time evolution is based on a modified $CPT$ inner product constructed in terms of a suitable $C$ operator. The resulting quantum mechanical evolution is shown to be unitary and probability is conserved by the oscillations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum Realization of Jet Clustering in High-Energy Physics Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the application of quantum technologies to fundamental sciences holds the key to fostering innovation for both sides. In high-energy particle collisions, quarks and gluons are produced and immediately form collimated particle sprays known as jets. Accurate jet clustering is crucial as it retains the information of the originating quark or gluon and forms the basis for studying properties of the Higgs boson, which underlies teh mechanism of mass generation for subatomic particles. For the first time, by mapping collision events into graphs--with particles as nodes and their angular separations as edges--we realize jet clustering using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for addressing classical combinatorial optimization problems with available quantum resources. Our results, derived from 30 qubits on quantum computer simulator and 6 qubits on quantum computer hardware, demonstrate that jet clustering performance with QAOA is comparable with or even better than classical algorithms for a small-sized problem. This study highlights the feasibility of quantum computing to revolutionize jet clustering, bringing the practical application of quantum computing in high-energy physics experiments one step closer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of low energies of many-body systems is a cornerstone of computational quantum sciences. Variational quantum algorithms can be used to prepare ground states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, but their lack of convergence guarantees and impractical number of cost function estimations prevent systematic scaling of experiments to large systems. Alternatives to variational approaches are needed for large-scale experiments on pre-fault-tolerant devices. Here, we use a superconducting quantum processor to compute eigenenergies of quantum many-body systems on two-dimensional lattices of up to 56 sites, using the Krylov quantum diagonalization algorithm, an analog of the well-known classical diagonalization technique. We construct subspaces of the many-body Hilbert space using Trotterized unitary evolutions executed on the quantum processor, and classically diagonalize many-body interacting Hamiltonians within those subspaces. These experiments show that quantum diagonalization algorithms are poised to complement their classical counterpart at the foundation of computational methods for quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is revisited by making use of the Hilbert space ${\cal H} \otimes {\cal H}_{AB}$, where ${\cal H}$ and ${\cal H}_{AB}$ stand, respectively, for the Hilbert space of the scalar field and of a generic bipartite quantum mechanical system. The construction of Hermitian, field-dependent, dichotomic operators is devised as well as the Bell-CHSH inequality. Working out the $AB$ part of the inequality, the resulting Bell-CHSH correlation function for the quantum field naturally emerges from unitary Weyl operators. Furthermore, introducing a Jaynes-Cummings type Hamiltonian accounting for the interaction between the scalar field and a pair of qubits, the quantum corrections to the Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of the scalar field are evaluated till the second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Exploring strong locality : Quantum state discrimination regime and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the conviction of switching information from locally accessible to locally hidden environs, the concept of hidden nonlocality activation has recently been highlighted by Bandyopadhyay et al. in [Phys. Rev. A 104, L050201 (2021)]. They have demonstrated that a certain locally distinguishable set of pure quantum states can be transformed into a locally indistinguishable set with certainty through orthogonality preserving local measurements (OPLMs). This transformation makes the set locally inaccessible, despite being locally accessible before. This phenomenon is defined as the activation of hidden nonlocality. In this paper, we present two classes of locally distinguishable sets within $(2m+1) \otimes 2 \otimes (2m+1)$ systems. One class reveals nonlocality through local operations, whereas the other requires joint measurements for it. As the later class depends on nonlocal operations to exhibit nonlocality, it arguably has a lower degree of nonlocality, and accordingly, can be considered as more local compared to the first class. This analysis exhibits a stronger manifestation of locality by elucidating the nuanced interplay between these distinct local phenomena within the framework of quantum state discrimination. Furthermore, we also explore their significant applications in the context of data hiding. Additionally, we introduce the concept of \emph{``strong local"} set and compare it with various activatable sets, highlighting differences in terms of locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Frenkel's integral representation of the quantum relative entropy provides a natural framework to derive continuity bounds for quantum information measures. Our main general result is a dimension-independent semi-continuity relation for the quantum relative entropy with respect to the first argument. Using it, we obtain a number of results: (1) a tight continuity relation for the conditional entropy in the case where the two states have equal marginals on the conditioning system, resolving a conjecture by Wilde in this special case; (2) a stronger version of the Fannes-Audenaert inequality on quantum entropy; (3) better estimates on the quantum capacity of approximately degradable channels; (4) an improved continuity relation for the entanglement cost; (5) general upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates in infinite-dimensional entanglement theory; and (6) a proof of a conjecture due to Christandl, Ferrara, and Lancien on the continuity of 'filtered' relative entropy distances.</description>

Abstract: Random spin systems at low temperatures are glassy and feature computational hardness in finding low-energy states. We study the random all-to-all interacting fermionic Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model and prove that, in contrast, (I) the low-energy states have polynomial circuit depth, yet (II) the annealed and quenched free energies agree to inverse-polynomially low temperatures, ruling out a glassy phase transition in this sense. These results are derived by showing that fermionic and spin systems significantly differ in their commutation index, which quantifies the non-commutativity of Hamiltonian terms. Our results suggest that low-temperature strongly interacting fermions, unlike spins, belong in a classically nontrivial yet quantumly easy phase.</description>

Abstract: Interest in quantum machine learning is increasingly growing due to its potential to offer more efficient solutions for problems that are difficult to tackle with classical methods. In this context, the research work presented here focuses on the use of quantum machine learning techniques for image classification tasks. We exploit a quantum extreme learning machine by taking advantage of its rich feature map provided by the quantum reservoir substrate. We systematically analyse different phases of the quantum extreme learning machine process, from the dataset preparation to the image final classification. In particular, we have tested different encodings, together with Principal Component Analysis, the use of Auto-Encoders, as well as the dynamics of the model through the use of different Hamiltonians for the quantum reservoir. Our results show that the introduction of a quantum reservoir systematically improves the accuracy of the classifier. Additionally, while different encodings can lead to significantly different performances, Hamiltonians with varying degrees of connectivity exhibit the same discrimination rate, provided they are interacting.</description>

Abstract: Memristive systems exhibit dynamics that depend on their past states, making them useful as memory units. Due to their functional resemblance to real synapses, memristors can also constitute the building blocks of neural networks for a variety of tasks. Recently, quantum memristor models have been proposed and notably, a photonic quantum memristor (PQM) has been experimentally proven. In this work, we explore and characterize various quantum properties that emerge from this specific model of PQM. Firstly, we find that a single PQM displays memristive dynamics on its quantum coherence. Secondly, we show that a network made of two independent PQMs can manifest memory effects on the dynamics of both entanglement and coherence of correlated photons traveling through the network, regardless of their distance. Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that: (i) this system can effectively be used for non-linear quantum computing under specific conditions, and (ii) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of testing properties of quantum channels. First, we show that testing identity to any channel $\mathcal N: \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{in}} \times d_{\mathrm{in}}} \to \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{out}} \times d_{\mathrm{out}}}$ in diamond norm distance requires $\Omega(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{in}}} / \varepsilon)$ queries, even in the strongest algorithmic model that admits ancillae, coherence, and adaptivity. This is due to the worst-case nature of the distance induced by the diamond norm.
  Motivated by this limitation and other theoretical and practical applications, we introduce an average-case analogue of the diamond norm, which we call the average-case imitation diamond (ACID) norm. In the weakest algorithmic model without ancillae, coherence, or adaptivity, we prove that testing identity to certain types of channels in ACID distance can be done with complexity independent of the dimensions of the channel, while for other types of channels the complexity depends on both the input and output dimensions. Building on previous work, we also show that identity to any fixed channel can be tested with $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in ACID distance and $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}}^2 d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in diamond distance in this model. Finally, we prove tight bounds on the complexity of channel tomography in ACID distance.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of multi-controlled Pauli gate decompositions with optimal $T$-count</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-controlled Pauli gates are typical high-level qubit operations that appear in the quantum circuits of various quantum algorithms. We find multi-controlled Pauli gate decompositions with smaller CNOT-count or $T$-depth while keeping the currently known minimum $T$-count. For example, for the CCCZ gate, we find decompositions with CNOT-count 7 or $T$-depth 2 while keeping the $T$-count at the currently known minimum of 6. The discovery of these efficient decompositions improves the computational efficiency of many quantum algorithms. What led to this discovery is the systematic procedure for constructing multi-controlled Pauli gate decompositions. This procedure not only deepens our theoretical understanding of quantum gate decomposition but also leads to more efficient decompositions that have yet to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Faraday Effect as a Two-State Quantum Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Faraday effect can be derived from a simple two-state model. This approach uses a quantized electromagnetic field and does not make reference to differences in refractive indices of left- and right-circularly polarized light. Instead it treats the effect as a forward Rayleigh scattering process between two orthogonal modes of the quantized field, and thus emphasises the quantum-mechanical aspects of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Virial expansion for the optical response of doped two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum virial expansion for the optical response of a doped two-dimensional semiconductor. As we show, this constitutes a perturbatively exact theory in the high-temperature or low-doping regime, where the electrons' thermal wavelength is smaller than their interparticle spacing. The virial expansion predicts new features of the photoluminescence, such as a non-trivial shape of the attractive branch related to universal low-energy exciton-electron scattering and an associated shift of the attractive peak from the trion energy. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped monolayer MoSe2 [Zipfel et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 075311 (2022)] and they imply that the trion binding energy is likely to have been overestimated in previous measurements. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify two distinct theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, with the conventional trion picture results emerging as a high-temperature and weak-interaction limit of Fermi polaron theory.</description>

      <title>Unitary k-designs from random number-conserving quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global $U(1)$ charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of $k$-fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a $k_c$-design with $k_c = O(L^d)$ for a system in $d$ spatial dimensions with linear dimension $L$. Second, for $k &lt; k_c$, we derive bounds on the depth $\tau$ required for the circuit to converge to an approximate $k$-design. The depth is lower bounded by diffusion $k L^2 \ln(L) \lesssim \tau$. In contrast, without number conservation $\tau \sim \text{poly}(k) L$. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks $k$ $U(1)$ symmetries. We conjecture that the associated Goldstone modes set the spectral gap for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions, leading to an upper bound $\tau \lesssim k L^{d+2}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of helicity states for general scattering processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum tomography has become an indispensable tool in order to compute the density matrix $\rho$ of quantum systems in Physics. Recently, it has further gained importance as a basic step to test entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities in High-Energy Particle Physics. In this work, we present the theoretical framework for reconstructing the helicity quantum initial state of a general scattering process. In particular, we perform an expansion of $\rho$ over the irreducible tensor operators $\{T^L_M\}$ and compute the corresponding coefficients uniquely by averaging, under properly chosen Wigner D-matrices weights, the angular distribution data of the final particles. Besides, we provide the explicit angular dependence of both the normalised differential cross section and the generalised production matrix $\Gamma$. Finally, we re-derive all our previous results from a quantum-information perspective using the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism and we obtain in addition simple analytical expressions for the Wigner $P$ and $Q$ symbols.</description>

      <title>Weaving the (AdS) spaces with partial entanglement entropy threads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we propose a general scheme for reconstructing bulk geometric quantities in a static pure AdS background using the partial entanglement entropy (PEE), a measure of the entanglement structure on the boundary CFT. The PEE between any two points $\mathcal{I}(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ serves as the fundamental building block of the PEE structure. Following \cite{Lin:2023rbd}, we geometrize any two-point PEE $\mathcal{I}(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ by the bulk geodesic connecting two boundary points $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$, which we call the PEE thread, with the density of the threads determined by the boundary PEE structure. In the AdS bulk, the set of all the PEE threads forms a continuous ``network'', which we call the PEE network.
  In this paper, we show that the density of the PEE threads passing through any bulk point is exactly $1/(4G)$. Based on this observation we give a complete reformulation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for a generic boundary region in general dimensional Poincar\'e AdS space. More explicitly, for any static boundary region $A$, the homologous surface $\Sigma_{A}$ that has the minimal number of intersections with the bulk PEE network is exactly the RT surface of $A$, and the minimal number of intersections reproduces the holographic entanglement entropy. The reconstruction for the area of bulk geometric quantities by counting the number of intersections with the bulk PEE network applies to generic bulk geometric quantities. Interestingly, this reconstruction indicates a pure geometric statement, which is exactly the so-called \emph{Crofton formula} in Poincar\'e AdS.</description>

      <title>Decoherence by warm horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) have shown that quantum superpositions held outside of Killing horizons will decohere at a steady rate. This occurs because of the inevitable radiation of soft photons (gravitons), which imprint a electromagnetic (gravitational) ``which-path'' memory onto the horizon. Rather than appealing to this global description, an experimenter ought to also have a local description for the cause of decoherence. One might intuitively guess that this is just the bombardment of Hawking/Unruh radiation on the system, however simple calculations challenge this idea -- the same superposition held in a finite temperature inertial laboratory does not decohere at the DSW rate. In this work we provide a local description of the decoherence by mapping the DSW set-up onto a worldline-localized model resembling an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector. We present an interpretation in terms of random local forces which do not sufficiently self-average over long times. Using the Rindler horizon as a concrete example we clarify the crucial role of temperature, and show that the Unruh effect is the only quantum mechanical effect underlying these random forces. A general lesson is that for an environment which induces Ohmic friction on the central system (as one gets from the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force, in an accelerating frame) the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies that when this environment is at finite temperature it will cause steady decoherence on the central system. Our results agree with DSW and provide the complementary local perspective.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>

      <title>Performance of a radio-frequency two-photon atomic magnetometer in different magnetic induction measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements monitoring the inductive coupling between oscillating radio-frequency magnetic fields and objects of interest create versatile platforms for non-destructive testing. The benefits of ultra low frequency measurements, i.e., below 3 kHz, are sometimes outweighed by the fundamental and technical difficulties related to operating pick-up coils or other field sensors in this frequency range. Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements. In this paper, all spectral components of the two-photon process are identified, which result from the non-linear interactions between the rf fields and atoms. A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, a self-compensation configuration is introduced, whereby high contrast measurements of defects can be obtained due to the sensor's insensitivity to the primary field, including using simplified instrumentation for this configuration by producing two rf fields with a single rf coil.</description>

      <title>Condensation phenomena of ions in an electrostatic logarithmic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of an electrostatic logarithmic trap (ELT) on an ionic gas confined in a cylindric chamber are studied in detail, with special reference to the effects of the ion-ion Coulombic interactions and the resulting low-temperature thermodynamics. The collapse of the ions in radially localized states, about the axial cathode, is shown to cause an abrupt (but not critical) transition from non degeneration to strong degeneration, at a special temperature $T_c$. This transition could actually involve both Bosons and Fermions and is not to be confused with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is excluded in principle. However, while for Bosons the resulting effects on the pressure are observable in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) regime, the Fermions' density should fall well below UHV, for the pressure change to be observable. This is because the ion-ion \emph{exchange} interactions increase the kinetic energy along the axial cathode, which makes the Fermi level and the non degeneration threshold temperature increase accordingly.</description>
