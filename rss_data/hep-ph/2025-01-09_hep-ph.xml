      <title>Axion misalignment with memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of producing axion dark matter (DM) via misalignment mechanisms in a non-standard cosmological era dominated by ultra-light primordial black holes (PBH). While the effect of PBH domination on the production of axion via vacuum misalignment is known assuming the PBH evaporation to proceed according to Hawking's semi-classical (SC) approximation, we go beyond these simplest possibilities to include kinetic misalignment of axion and backreaction effect of emitted particles on the PBH themselves, referred to as the memory-burden (MB) effect. We show that, depending upon the type of misalignment mechanism and PBH evaporation regime, the axion as well as PBH parameter space consistent with the observed DM relic changes significantly having interesting implications for axion detection experiments. PBH also offer complementary detection prospects via gravitational wave due to PBH density fluctuations and excess radiation due to emission of hot axions within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing triple-gauge couplings in anomalous gauge theories at hadron and lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge anomalous quantum field theories are inconsistent as full UV theories since they lead to the breaking of Lorentz invariance or Unitarity, as well as non-renormalizability. It is well known, however, that they can be interpreted as effective field theories (EFT) with a cut-off. The latter cannot be made arbitrarily large and it is related to the energy scale at which additional fermions with suitable gauge charges enter, rendering the full model anomaly-free. A nondecoupling effect that remains in the EFT is the appearance of anomalous loop-induced triple-gauge couplings, encapsulating information from the full UV theory. In this work we take as an example an Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)'_\mu$ under which $2^{nd}$-generation leptons are axially charged, leading to an EFT that consists of the Standard Model (SM) with an additional massive $Z'$ gauge boson. As a consequence, there are triple gauge couplings involving the $Z'$ and Electroweak SM gauge bosons via mixed gauge anomalies. We study the possibility of probing these loop suppressed anomalous couplings at hadron and lepton colliders, with $Z'$-lepton couplings allowed by current experimental bounds, finding that due to the large SM backgrounds and small signal, the HL-LHC is incapable of this task. The 100 TeV $pp$ collider at $\mathcal{L}=20~\mathrm {ab}^{-1}$ on the other hand could probe anomalous couplings for $m_{Z'}\in[150,800]~\mathrm{GeV}$ and obtain discovery significances for $m_{Z'}\in[230,330]~\mathrm{GeV}$. Lepton colliders are also well suited for probing these anomalous couplings. In particular we show that a muon collider running at the $Z'$-resonance and an electron-positron collider such as CLIC with $\sqrt{s}=3~{\rm TeV}$ can be complimentary in probing the anomalous couplings for $m_{Z'}\in[100,700]~{\rm GeV}$, with CLIC sensitive to discovery for $m_{Z'}\in[125,225]~{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Two-loop form factors for $P$-wave quarkonium production and decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytical results for the two-loop form factors needed for $\chi_{Q,J}$ production and decay. We consider the two-loop corrections to the process $\gamma \gamma \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[1]}}$, that has been known only numerically before, and the processes $gg \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[1]}}$, $\gamma g \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[8]}}$ and $gg \leftrightarrow {^3 P_J^{[8]}}$, which have not been computed before. We observe that the NRQCD pole structure of the two-loop amplitude in the $gg$ channel is more involved for the spin-triplet $P$-wave case than for the pseudo-scalar $S$-wave case. It involves in addition to the standard Coulomb singularity also a new singularity whose cancellation requires the inclusion of the $gg \leftrightarrow {^3S_1^{[8]}}$ form factor. We give the high precision numerical results for the hard functions that can be used to compute $\chi_{Q,J}$ production and decay up to NNLO accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the $\theta$-angle physics of QCD under pressure: The strange and isospin phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil the impact of the $\theta$-angle on the QCD phase diagram at nonzero isospin and strangeness chemical potentials for three light flavors and different quark mass ratios. We establish the phase boundaries as well as the nature of the associated phase transitions. The order parameters and the physical spectrum in the different phases are determined. We further elucidate the physics around $\theta=\pi$ where we discover a novel parity-preserving superfluid phase. Finally, we comment on Dashen's phenomenon in the superfluid phases when varying the number of light flavors.</description>

      <title>Coupled channel effects for the bottom-strange mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calculated the mass spectrum of $B_s$ mesons within a nonrelativistic potential model considering coupled channel effects, and the corresponding strong decay widths within the $^3P_0$ model using the numerically calculated wave functions. By comparing with the available experimental data, we find that the states $B_s$, $B_s^*$, $B_{s1}(5830)$, and $B_{s2}^*(5840)$ could be interpreted as the $B_s(1^1S_0)$, $B_s(1^3S_1)$, $B_s(1P^\prime)$, and $B_s(1^3P_2)$, respectively. Although the quantum numbers of the newly observed $B_s(6064)$ and $B_s(6158)$ states have not been determined, our results support the assignments of $B_s(1^3D_3)$ and $B_s(1^3D_1)$ for them. Our predictions are helpful in searching for the bottom-strange meson in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos provide a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. This proceeding is a brief summary of a plenary talk given at the 12th Neutrino Oscillation Workshop (NOW2024). We present a discussion on various topics on neutrino non-standard properties, such as the origin of neutrino mass, their decay modes, interaction mechanisms, and a potential connection to dark matter. Constraints and observational results from cosmology, astrophysics, and laboratory experiments are reviewed to illustrate the interplay between neutrino physics and broader questions about the universe.</description>

      <title>Imaginary potential and thermal width in the spinning black hole background from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the imaginary potential and thermal width of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Using a holographic approach, we systematically analyze how angular momentum influences these quantities. Our results reveal that increasing angular momentum causes the imaginary potential to emerge at smaller interquark distances, suggesting that angular momentum accelerates quarkonium melting. Furthermore, we find that angular momentum enhances the thermal width, indicating greater instability of the bound state at higher angular momentum. Notably, we observe that the effect of angular momentum on quarkonium dissociation is more pronounced when the axis of the quark-antiquark pair is transverse to the direction of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <title>Precision Higgs Constraints in U(1) Extensions of the Standard Model with a Light Z'-Boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly free $U(1)$ extensions of the standard model (SM) predict a new neutral gauge boson $Z'$. When the $Z'$ obtains its mass from the spontaneous breaking of the new $U(1)$ symmetry by a new complex scalar field, the model also predicts a second real scalar $s$ and the searches for the new scalar and the new gauge boson become intertwined. We present the computation of production cross sections and decay widths of such a scalar $s$ in models with a light $Z'$ boson, when the decay $h\to Z' Z'$ may have a sizeable branching ratio. We show how Higgs signal strength measurement in this channel can provide stricter exclusion bounds on the parameters of the model than those obtained from the total signal strength for Higgs boson production.</description>

      <title>Isospin strikes back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming isospin conservation, the decay of a $c\bar c$ vector meson into the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state is purely electromagnetic. At the leading order, the $c\bar c$ vector meson first converts into a virtual photon that, then produces the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state. Moreover, such a mechanism, i.e., the virtual photon coupling to \LS, is the solely intermediate process through which, in Born approximation, the reaction $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ does proceed. It follows that any significant difference between the amplitudes of the processes $c\bar c\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ at the $c\bar c$ mass must be ascribed to an isospin-violating contribution in the $c\bar c$ decay. In Eur. Phys. J. C $\boldsymbol{80}$, 903 (2020) we studied the decay of the $\psi(2S)$ vector meson into $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and, on the light of the large branching fraction ${\rm BR}_{18}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.23\pm0.24)\times 10^{-5}$, published in the 2018 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{98}$, 030001 (2018), we claimed either the presence of a significant isospin-violating contribution or, with a lesser emphasis, a "not complete reliability of the only available datum". In any case, we propose a new measurement. Apparently, our second and considered less serious hypothesis was the right one, indeed the branching fraction published in the 2024 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{110}$, 030001 (2024) is $ {\rm BR}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$, more than seven times lower with the error that increased from $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 45\%$.</description>

      <title>The Non-Relativistic Limit of Keldysh Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keldysh spinors obey Dirac equation, but have the negative of the Dirac action and Hamiltonian. In an example of the U(1) EM coupling, we show that, despite the sign changes, they have a well-defined non-relativistic limit resulting in quantum mechanics with the positive-definite Pauli Hamiltonian. When non-relativistic Dirac and Keldysh fields are brought to interact, we observe curious decoupling of the two fields in mass-like and vector couplings.</description>

      <title>ALPs coupled to gluons in the GeV mass range -- data-driven and consistent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new, fully consistent framework for describing GeV-scale axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to gluons. Unlike previous approaches, which either rely on pure chiral perturbation theory or introduce scheme-dependent parameters, our treatment simultaneously (i) enforces invariance under unphysical chiral rotations used to remove the ALP-gluon coupling, and (ii) incorporates heavier resonances relevant at the GeV scale. This construction enables robust matching between exclusive and perturbative descriptions of ALP decays, and reveals that commonly used descriptions can underestimate or overestimate ALP decay widths and production rates by orders of magnitude. We further show that the production of ALPs at proton accelerator experiments can incur large theoretical uncertainties, significantly impacting ALP event yields at past and future Lifetime Frontier experiments.</description>

      <title>Properties of QCD axion in two-flavor color superconductive matter with massive quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of QCD axion at low temperature and moderate density in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with instanton induced interactions by simultaneously considering the scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates in both quark-antiquark and diquark channels. We derive the analytical dispersion relations of quarks with four-type condensates at nonzero theta angle $\theta=a/f_a$. The axion mass, quadratic self-coupling, and the axion potential are calculated in both the chiral symmetry broken and two-flavor color superconductive phases. Using the commonly adopted model parameters, we find that due to the emergence of color superconductivity, the chiral phase transition not only does not lead to a significant decrease in axion mass and self-coupling, but rather results in an obvious enhancement of them. As a $\theta$ function, the axion potential exhibits an appropriate period of $\pi$, which is quite different from the case without considering the color superconductivity. The surface tension of axion domain wall is also calculated in the presence of color superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We explore the decay properties of the isovector and isoscalar $1^{-+}$ light hybrids, $\pi_1$ and $\eta_1$, in $N_f=2$ lattice QCD at a pion mass $m_\pi \approx 417~\mathrm{MeV}$. The McNeile and Michael method is adopted to extract the effective couplings for individual decay modes, which are used to estimate the partial decay widths of $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ by assuming SU(3) symmetry. The partial decay widths of $\pi_1(1600)$ are predicted to be $(\Gamma_{b_1\pi}, \Gamma_{f_1(1285)\pi}, \Gamma_{\rho\pi}, \Gamma_{K^*\bar{K}}) = (325 \pm 75, \mathcal{O}(10), 52 \pm 7, 8.6 \pm 1.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$, and the total width is estimated to be $396 \pm 90~\mathrm{MeV}$, considering only statistical errors. If $\eta_1(1855)$ and the $4.4\sigma$ signal observed by BESIII (labeled as $\eta_1(2200)$) are taken as the two mass eigenstates of the isoscalar $1^{-+}$ light hybrids in SU(3), then the dominant decay channel(s) of $\eta_1(1855)$ ($\eta_1(2200)$) is $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ ($K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ and $K_1(1400)\bar{K}$) through the $1^{+(-)}0^{-(+)}$ mode. The vector-vector decay modes are also significant for the two $\eta_1$ states. Using the mixing angle $\alpha \approx 22.7^\circ$ obtained from lattice QCD for the two $\eta_1$ states, the total widths are estimated to be $\Gamma_{\eta_1(1855)}=282(85)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{\eta_1(2200)}=455(143)~\mathrm{MeV}$. The former is compatible with the experimental width of $\eta_1(1855)$. Although many systematic uncertainties are not well controlled, these results are qualitatively informative for the experimental search for light hybrids.</description>

      <title>An Open Effective Field Theory for light in a medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many scenarios of interest, a quantum system interacts with an unknown environment, necessitating the use of open quantum system methods to capture dissipative effects and environmental noise. With the long-term goal of developing a perturbative theory for open quantum gravity, we take an important step by studying Abelian gauge theories within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We begin with a pedagogical review of general results for open free theories, setting the stage for our primary focus: constructing the most general open effective field theory for electromagnetism in a medium. We assume locality in time and space, but allow for an arbitrary finite number of derivatives. Crucially, we demonstrate that the two copies of the gauge group associated with the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour are not broken but are instead deformed by dissipative effects. We provide a thorough discussion of gauge fixing, define covariant gauges, and calculate the photon propagators, proving that they yield gauge-invariant results. A notable result is the discovery that gauge invariance is accompanied by non-trivial constraints on noise fluctuations. We derive these constraints through three independent methods, highlighting their fundamental significance for the consistent formulation of open quantum gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Many-body atomic response functions of xenon and germanium for leading-order sub-GeV dark matter-electron interactions in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct searches of dark matter candidates with mass energies less than 1 GeV is an active research field. The energy depositions are comparable to the scale of atomic, molecular, or condensed matter systems, therefore many-body physics plays an important role in understanding the detector's response in dark matter scattering. We present in this work a comprehensive data set of atomic response functions for xenon and germanium with 12.2 and 80 eV energy thresholds, respectively, using the (multiconfiguration) relativistic random phase approximation. This approach takes into account the relativistic, exchange, and correlation effects in one self-consistent framework, and is benchmarked successfully by photoabsorption data from thresholds to 30 keV with $\lesssim5\%$ errors. Comparisons with our previous and some other independent particle approaches in literature are made. It is also found that the spin-dependent (SD) response has significant difference from the spin-independent (SI) one such that the dark matter SD and SI interactions with electrons can be distinguished in unpolarized scattering, which is typical for direct search detectors. Finally, the exclusion limits set by current experiments are updated with our new results.</description>

      <title>A novel BPS bound with a first order BPS system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel BPS bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations which satisfy a system of two first-order PDE: when such BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are satisfied as well. The analytic solutions of this BPS system constructed in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Understanding the approach to thermalization in a non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ of physical states in a SU(2) gauge theory both in and out-of-thermal equilibrium conditions using ab-initio lattice techniques. A non-equilibrium state is realized starting from an over-occupied initial condition for low momentum, soft gluons whereas the thermal state comprises of strongly interacting soft gluons at temperatures where these are well separated from the hard momentum modes. A spectra of positive Lyapunov exponents is observed in both these states, similar to a chaotic dynamical system. From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate the typical time-scale of $\sim 0.50(3)$ fm/c to achieve thermalization at $T\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. We also measure, for the first time, the $\lambda_L$ for long wavelength critical modes of SU(2) using the out-of-time-ordered correlation functions of a classical $Z_2$ scalar field theory, which shares the same universal behavior near the deconfinement phase transition. The $\lambda_L$ is observed to maximize at the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Effective action for relativistic hydrodynamics from Crooks fluctuation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new effective theory framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics in the relativistic regime is derived using standard thermodynamical principles and general properties of non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics. For the first time, we establish clear and concise conditions for ensuring that the resulting effective theories are causal, stable, and well-posed within general relativity. These properties are independent of spacetime foliation and are valid in the full nonlinear regime. Out-of-equilibrium fluctuations are constrained by a relativistically covariant version of Crooks fluctuation theorem, which determines how the entropy production is distributed even when the system is driven by an external force. This leads to an emerging $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for imposing fluctuation-dissipation relations for n-point correlation functions, which matches the standard constraints for the Schwinger-Keldysh effective action.</description>

      <title>Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter annihilating into light-long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of 10 nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section using model-independent methods. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld Enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process, obtaining bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbations from a New Approach to Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper we proposed a new approach to the beginning of inflation -- a lingering universe. The universe begins in a lingering state with a nearly vanishing Hubble parameter. This calls into question the absolute age of the universe, as the Hubble time can be nearly infinite. It also provides promise for addressing the initial singularity of inflation and issues with quantum field theory in de Sitter space-time. Such models arise in classical cosmologies with non-vanishing spatial curvature (inspired by PLANCK 2018 data), and independently by models that arise in string cosmology. In this paper, we consider the importance of cosmological perturbations for the stability of the lingering phase and how this influences cosmological observations. Our goal is to establish observables in this new paradigm for the origin of inflation which is in contrast to eternal inflation and cyclic cosmologies. We also address questions of stability and the transition to inflation.</description>

      <title>Chiral and isospin breaking in the 2-flavour Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model with two massive fermions is a non-trivial theory for which no analytical solution is known. The strong coupling limit of the theory allows for different semiclassical approximations to extract properties of its low-lying spectrum. In particular, analytical results exist for the fermion condensate, the fermion mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson mass or its decay constant. These approximations, nonetheless, are not able to quantitatively predict isospin breaking effects in the light spectrum, for example. In this paper we use lattice simulations to test various analytical predictions, and study isospin breaking effects from non-degenerate quark masses. We also introduce a low-energy effective field theory based on a non-linear sigma model with a dilaton field, which leads to the correct fermion mass dependence of the pion mass, the correct $\sigma$-to-$\pi$ mass ratio and a prediction of the isospin breaking effects, which we test numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several indications of lepton non-universality observables have been perceived in semileptonic $B$ meson decay processes, both in the neutral-current ($b \to s ll $) and charged-current ($b \to c l \bar \nu_l$) transitions. Influenced by these fascinating quotients, we examine the semileptonic decays involving the $b \to c l \bar \nu_l$ quark level transitions. We execute it through a model independent analysis in order to probe the nature of new physics. Taking into consideration the most general effective Hamiltonian, we scrutinize $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau \bar \nu_\tau$, $ B_c^+ \to \eta_c \tau^+ \nu_\tau$, and $ B \to D^{**} \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ (where $D^{**} = \{D^*_0, D_1^*, D_1, D_2^*\}$ are the four lightest excited charm mesons) processes, in the presence of new physics. We perform a global fit to different sets of new coefficients, making use of the measurements on $R_{D}$, $R_{D^{*}}$, $R_{J/\psi}$, $P_{\tau}^{D^*}$ and the upper limit on Br($B_c^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$). We then inspect the effect of constrained new couplings on the branching ratios, forward-backward asymmetry parameters, lepton non-universality ratios (LNU), lepton and hadron polarization asymmetries of these decay modes.</description>

      <title>Schwinger particle production: Rapid switch off of the external field versus dynamical assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the process of electron-positron pair production in the presence of strong electric backgrounds being rapidly switched on and off and examine the total particle yield. For sufficiently sharp field profiles, the particle number can be substantially enhanced. It is demonstrated that this enhancement is quite similar to the phenomenon of dynamical assistance by a weak high-frequency field superimposed on a strong background. Both these mechanisms are analyzed by means of exact numerical computations, worldline instanton approach, and the locally-constant field approximation. We identify the time scale of the switching profile leading to the pair-production enhancement and argue that the particle yield is highly unlikely to be increased by shaping the switch off of realistic laser pulses. On the other hand, we confirm that it is feasible to observe the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect by adding a rapidly oscillating field to a strong electric background.</description>

      <title>A modular perspective to the jet suppression from a small to large radius in very high transverse momentum jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we expand the scope of the JETSCAPE framework to investigate the dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, on the jet radius parameter ($R$) for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets extending up to 1 TeV to probe the quark-gluon plasma medium at much shorter distance scales. It focuses on quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed during Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, particularly for the most-central (0-10\%) collisions. Jet-medium interactions represent a pivotal domain of both theoretical and experimental QGP studies, with various models offering different assumptions to describe these phenomena. To illustrate this modular approach, this work computes the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets via coupling of the MATTER model (which simulates the high virtuality phase of the parton evolution) with the LBT model (which simulates the low virtuality phase of the parton evolution). Additionally, the two successful energy loss models: MARTINI and AdS/CFT are employed to characterize the jet-suppression effectively within the JETSCAPE framework. The results are compared with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors, covering jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$) ranging from 100 GeV to 1 TeV for ATLAS and 300 GeV to 1 TeV for CMS. The predictions made by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes, showing deviation within 10-25\%. Our major focus is on calculating the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet-R and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the experimental results align well with predictions from the JETSCAPE framework.</description>

      <title>Visible GeV ALP from TeV Vector-like Leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model where a GeV axion-like-particle (ALP) is predicted in a large portion of the parameter space due to the presence of explicit Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking terms in an exotic leptonic sector. The latter provides a solution to the muon $g-2$ anomaly, within the framework of the Linear Seesaw neutrino mechanism. The spectrum is extended by a complex scalar singlet only transforming under the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which generates the ALP. Its couplings with fermions can continuously span over many orders of magnitude, which constitutes a specific feature of this model in contrast to generic ultraviolet constructions. Interestingly, these couplings are suppressed by the ALP characteristic scale that can be as low as the TeV scale, which represents a novel feature of the model and opens up to several phenomenological consequences.</description>

Abstract: The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 70s. Nearly half a century later, we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to proton and neutron's Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer, to the leading-twist accuracy in collinear factorization. The NLO hard-scattering kernel is computed in the Krankl and Manashov renormalization scheme. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Confronting our state-of-the-art pQCD predictions with the available data for nucleon Dirac form factors, in both space-like and time-like regions, imposes a stringent test on the validity of the parameterized forms of nucleon leading-twist light-cone-distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which have been predicted by a class of QCD sum rules-based models and lattice QCD simulation.</description>

      <title>Ultimate light-shining-through-a-wall experiments to establish QCD axions as the dominant form of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing the axion as the dark matter (DM) particle after a haloscope discovery typically requires follow-up experiments to break the degeneracy between the axion's coupling to photons and its local DM abundance. Given that a discovery would justify more significant investments, we explore the prospects of ambitious light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) setups to probe the QCD axion band. Leveraging the excellent mass determination in haloscopes, we show how to design LSW experiments with lengths on the order of 100 km and suitably aligned magnetic fields with apertures of around 1 m to reach well-motivated axion models across up to four orders of magnitude in mass. Beyond presenting a concrete plan for post-discovery experimental efforts, we briefly discuss complementary experiments and future directions beyond LSW experiments.</description>

      <title>Holographic Schwinger Effect in Flavor-Dependent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic Schwinger effect is investigated in systems with $N_{f}=0$, $N_{f}=2$, and $N_{f}=2+1$ using the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, incorporating equation of state and baryon number susceptibility information from lattice QCD. It is found that the critical electric field is smallest for $N_{f}=0$, indicating that the Schwinger effect is more likely to occur than in systems with $N_{f}=2$ and $N_{f}=2+1$. The critical electric field decreases with increasing chemical potential and temperature across all systems. Additionally, potential analysis confirms that the maximum total potential energy increases with the number of flavors, suggesting that existing particles may reduce the probability of particle pair production.</description>

      <title>Searches for long-lived dark photons at proton accelerator experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic and unified analysis of the capability of lifetime frontier experiments to probe the parameter space of hypothetical long-lived particles is crucial for defining the targets of future searches. However, such a comprehensive study has not yet been conducted for dark photons - hypothetical massive particles that kinetically mix with Standard Model photons. Existing studies often rely on outdated assumptions about dark photon phenomenology, leading to inaccurate calculations of the parameter space, including regions already excluded or relevant for future experiments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive calculation of the parameter space for GeV-scale dark photons and light dark matter accessible to lifetime frontier experiments. Our analysis highlights how theoretical uncertainties in dark photon phenomenology can significantly impact experimental sensitivity across coupling and mass parameters. To facilitate further investigation, we provide these results in a publicly accessible form, incorporating updated dark photon phenomenology into the event generator \texttt{SensCalc}.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the weak semileptonic decay of the $ \Omega^{+}_{ccb} \rightarrow \Xi^{++}_{cc} ~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$, where a triply heavy baryon with spin 1/2 decays into the observed doubly heavy baryon with spin 1/2, using QCD sum rule method in all lepton channels. We compute the six relevant vector and axial vector form factors entering the low energy matrix elements in full theory. The invariant form factors are building blocks, using the fit faction of which in terms of $ q^2 $ in whole physical region, we calculate the exclusive widths in three lepton channels. Our predictions may help the present and future experiments in the course of their search for doubly and triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>NLO EW corrections to tau pair production via photon fusion in Pb-Pb ultraperipheral collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to the $\gamma \gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ process in Pb-Pb ultraperipheral collision (UPC). We find that the EW correction $\delta \sigma_{\mathrm{EW}}$ decreases the total cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{NLO}} = \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}} + \delta \sigma_{\mathrm{EW}}$ by -3\% at Pb-Pb center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. The weak correction plays significant role whose contribution is about -4 times of that of QED. The CMS and ATLAS collaborations use the reaction $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ in Pb-Pb and proton-proton UPC to constrain tau's anomalous magnetic moment $a_\tau$. By parameterizing the $\gamma \tau \tau$ vertex with two form factors $F_{1,2}$, the cross section can be written as $\sigma_{a_\tau} = \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}} + \delta \sigma_{a_\tau}$, where $\delta \sigma_{a_\tau}$ is proportional to $a_\tau$. The impact of NLO EW corrections on $a_\tau$ bounds in Pb-Pb UPC is limited, as the current experimental bounds are loose. We also find that various differential distributions of the two ratios $\mathrm{d} \sigma_{\mathrm{NLO}}/ \mathrm{d} \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}}$ and $\mathrm{d} \sigma_{a_\tau}/ \mathrm{d} \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}}$ have different lineshapes. This work is significant to precisely study the interaction of $\gamma \tau \tau$ via $\gamma \gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ process.</description>

      <title>Dispersion theory of nucleon (nucleus) Compton scattering spin polarizabilities and quasi-optical $\gamma$-ray polarization plane rotation and birefringence effect in a matter with polarized protons (nuclei)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental observation of quasi-optical phenomenon of $\gamma$-quanta polarization plane rotation in matter with polarized proton (nuclei) is demonstrated to be possible. This effect is similar to the magneto-optic Faraday effect (Faraday optical rotation). Quasi-optical birefringence effect for $\gamma$-quanta in matter with polarized nuclei having spin $S \ge 1$ could also be observed. The latter effect is similar to double refraction (birefringence) of light in uniaxial and biaxial crystals. The above phenomena open up possibility to investigate how spin vector and tensor polarizabilities depend on $\gamma$-quanta energy. In particular, studying the effect of $\gamma$-quanta polarization plane rotation, it is possible to find the range of $\gamma$-quanta energies, which is associated with strong dependence of spin polarizability on $\gamma$-quanta energy.</description>

      <title>An Improved Precision Calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ Contact Term within Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is an as-yet unobserved nuclear process, which stands to provide crucial insights for model-building beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Its detection would simultaneously confirm the hypothesis that neutrinos are Majorana fermions, thus violating lepton-number conservation, and provide the first measurement of the absolute neutrino mass scale. This work aims to improve the estimation within chiral effective field theory of the so-called ''contact term'' for $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay, a short-range two-nucleon effect which is unaccounted for in traditional nuclear approaches to the process. We conduct a thorough review of the justifications for this contact term and the most precise computation of its size to date ($g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.3(6) at renormalisation point $\mu=m_\pi$), whose precision is limited by a truncation to elastic intermediate hadronic states. We then perform an extension of this analysis to a subleading class of inelastic intermediate states which we characterise, delivering an updated figure for the contact coefficient ($g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.4(3) at $\mu=m_\pi$) with uncertainty reduced by half. Such ab initio nuclear results, especially with enhanced precision, show promise for the resolution of disagreements between estimates of $0\nu\beta\beta$ from different many-body methods.</description>

      <title>HQET sum rules for matrix elements of dimension-six four-quark operators for meson lifetimes within and beyond the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theory predictions of heavy-hadron lifetime ratios critically depend on precise determinations of the dimension-six spectator effects arising from the double insertion of the weak effective $|\Delta B| = 1$ Hamiltonian. In the presence of beyond-standard-model (BSM) operators, the resulting $\Delta B = 0$ Hamiltonian features additional four-quark operators whose matrix elements need to be determined using non-perturbative methods. We present for the first time results for the non-perturbative hadronic matrix elements of the four-quark operators relevant for the description of the meson lifetime ratio $\tau\left(B^+\right) / \tau\left(B_d\right)$, obtained using heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) sum rules with the full BSM effective Hamiltonian. In addition, we recompute and update the bag parameters for the Standard Model operators.</description>

      <title>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

We compute the effective operators that emerge at two-loop for two example models: heavy electroweak complex Triplet and Doublet scalars. We present our results on the SILH basis. We also capture the effect in the fermion sector. For these two scenarios, we compute all the fermionic effective operators up to dimension six.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the topological susceptibility and the axion properties in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field, considering a three flavor NJL model that includes strong CP violation through a 't Hooft-like flavor mixing term. Both thermal and finite density effects are studied for magnetic fields up to 1 GeV$^2$, and the corresponding phase transitions are analyzed. To capture the inverse magnetic catalysis effect at finite temperatures and densities, a magnetic field-dependent coupling constant is considered. Our analytical and numerical results are compared with those previously obtained from lattice QCD, chiral perturbation theory and other effective models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some scenarios for the early universe, non-relativistic thermal dark matter chemically decouples from the thermal environment once the temperature drops well below the dark matter mass. The value at which the energy density freezes out depends on the underlying model. In a simple setting, we provide a comprehensive study of heavy fermionic dark matter interacting with the light degrees of freedom of a dark thermal sector whose temperature $T$ decreases from an initial value close to the freeze-out temperature. Different temperatures imply different hierarchies of energy scales. By exploiting the methods of non-relativistic effective field theories at finite $T$, we systematically determine the thermal and in-vacuum interaction rates. In particular, we address the impact of the Debye mass on the observables and ultimately on the dark matter relic abundance. We numerically compare the corrections to the present energy density originating from the resummation of Debye mass effects with the corrections coming from a next-to-leading order treatment of the bath-particle interactions. We observe that the fixed-order calculation of the inelastic heavy-light scattering at high temperatures provides a larger dark matter depletion, and hence an undersized yield for given benchmark points in the parameter space, with respect to the calculation where Debye mass effects are resummed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06953v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report investigates general relativity and the Yang-Mills theory in four-dimensional space-time using a common mathematical framework, the Chern-Weil theory for principal bundles. The whole theory is described owing to the fibre bundle with the GL(4) symmetry by twisting several principal bundles with the gauge symmetry.
  In addition to the principal connection, we introduce the Hodge-dual connection into the Lagrangian to make gauge fields have dynamics independent from the Bianchi identity. We show that the duplex superstructure appears in the bundle when a Z2-grading operator exists in the total space of the bundle in general. The Dirac operator appears in the secondary superspace using the one-dimensional Clifford algebra, and it provides topological indices from the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.
  Though the topological index is usually discussed in the elliptic-type manifold, this report treats it in the hyperbolic-type space-time manifold using a novel method, the theta-metric space. The theta-metric treats the Euclidean and Minkowski spaces simultaneously and defines the topological index in the Minkowski space-time.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Features of Parton Energy Loss in Heavy-ion Collisions at RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energetic quarks and gluons lose energy as they traverse the hot and dense medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles quantifies parton energy loss in such collisions, with the particle spectrum in $p+p$ collisions as a reference. Previous $R_{AA}$ measurements at RHIC energies have revealed an approximately constant trend at high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$), implying a scenario where parton energy loss, $\Delta p_{T}$, scales proportionally with $p_{T}$, a feature naively expected from energy loss dynamics in elastic collisions. In this study, we investigate the LHC $R_{AA}$ measurements which exhibit a pronounced $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for various particle species, and our analysis attributes this behavior to $\Delta p_T$ being approximately proportional to $\sqrt{p_{T}}$. These distinct features are consistent with model calculations of dominant radiative energy loss dynamics at the LHC, in contrast to the dominance of collisional energy loss at RHIC. Additionally, the linear increase of fractional energy loss with medium density at different $p_{T}$ magnitudes affirms the previous empirical observation that the magnitude of the energy loss depends mostly on the initial entropy density, with no significant path-length dependence. Implications on the dynamical scenarios of parton energy loss and future experimental investigations will also be discussed.</description>

Abstract: We use a combination of high-redshift observables to extract the strongest constraints to date on the fraction of axion fuzzy dark matter (FDM) in the mass window $10^{-26}\,\mathrm{eV}\!\lesssim\! m_\mathrm{FDM}\!\lesssim\!10^{-23}\,\mathrm{eV}$. These observables include ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) at redshifts $4-10$ measured by the Hubble Space Telescope, a constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction from high-redshift quasar spectroscopy, the cosmic microwave background optical depth to reionization measurement from Planck and upper bounds on the 21cm power spectrum from HERA. In order to calculate these signals for FDM cosmology, we use the 21cmFirstCLASS code to interface between AxiCLASS and 21cmFAST and consistently account for the full cosmic history from recombination to reionization. To facilitate a full Bayesian likelihood analysis, we developed a machine-learning based pipeline, which is both accurate, and enables a swift statistical inference, orders of magnitude faster than a brute force approach. We find that FDM of mass $m_\mathrm{FDM} \!= \!10^{-23} \, \mathrm{eV}$ is bound to less than $16\%$ of the total dark matter, where the constrains strengthen towards smaller masses, reaching down to $1\%$ for $m_\mathrm{FDM}\! =\! 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{eV}$, both at $95\%$ confidence level. In addition, we forecast that a future detection of the 21cm power spectrum with HERA will lower the upper bound at $m_\mathrm{FDM}\! =\! 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to $\lesssim\!1\%$.</description>

      <title>The massless S-matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contradistinction to the case of massive excitations, the connection between integrability and the tree-level massless scattering matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models is lost. Namely, in well-known 2-d integrable models the tree-level massless S-matrix exhibits particle production and fails to factorise. This is conjectured to happen due to IR ambiguities in the massless tree-level amplitudes. We present a definition of the massless S-matrix which has all the nice properties of integrable theories, there is no particle production and the S-matrix factorises. As an example, we present in detail the case of the $SU(2)$ principal chiral model (PCM).</description>

      <title>On the Gravitational Wave Counterpart to a Gamma-ray Galactic Center Signal from Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The new tools of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy allow for the study of astrophysical phenomenon in new ways and enables light to be shed on some of the longest-enduring mysteries of high-energy astrophysics. Among the latter stands the Galactic center gamma-ray excess, associated with a source whose nature could be annihilating dark matter or a yet-unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). MSPs are most likely asymmetric about their axis of rotation, and are thus thought to also source quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves, that dark matter processes would not emit. Using statistical methods, we simulate realistic MSP population samples with differing morphology and moment of inertia, that could give rise to the gamma-ray excess, and we compute the corresponding gravitational wave signal amplitude and frequency. We find that the gravitational wave signal frequency likely ranges between $\sim$200 and 1400 Hz, and that the collective dimensionless strain from the center of the Galaxy has an amplitude between $10^{-26}$ and $10^{-24}$, thus most likely beyond current and near-term detectors, unless the unresolved MSPs are extraordinarily gamma-ray dim.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from the Hagedorn Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We illustrate the main points behind the computation of the gravitational wave spectrum originated from a phase in the early universe where the energy density is dominated by highly excited fundamental string degrees of freedom - a Hagedorn phase. This phase is described using the Boltzmann equation approach to string thermodynamics, which we illustrate via a toy model which permits analytic computations for the evolution of perturbations. This window into the out-of-equilibrium regime allows us to compute equilibration rates and conclude that, in realistic scenarios, long, open strings dominate the ensemble, source gravitational waves and provide a succesful reheating. Furthermore, we compare the results against the Standard Model prediction for a gravitational wave background of thermal origin and conclude that the string prediction is larger. This is one of the few cases in which a signal of stringy origin dominates over the field theory analogue. This work is based on arXiv:2310.11494 and arXiv:2408.13803 and is a contribution to the Proceedings of the 29th symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS 2024).</description>

      <title>Exploring the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ interaction via femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very recently the Wood-Saxon (WS) type interaction in the single-folding potential approach are constructed to simulate the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials. One set of the $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials are based on the first principle HAL QCD $\phi{\text -}N $ interactions in $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel, and in another set, the $\phi$-meson-nucleus potentials were calculated by employing the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. By utilizing these two set of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ potentials, the two-particle momentum correlation of $ \phi{\text -}\alpha $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored. The numerical results show that the correlation functions at small source size (high density nuclear medium) depends on the employed potential model. Also, the correlation functions are obtained within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism. For small source size, it is found that, the LL formula returns significantly different values due to the large interaction range of the $\phi{\text -}\alpha $ potential.</description>

      <title>Learning Hadron Emitting Sources with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation function observed in high-energy collision experiments encodes critical information about the emitted source and hadronic interactions. While the proton-proton interaction potential is well constrained by nucleon-nucleon scattering data, these measurements offer a unique avenue to investigate the proton-emitting source, reflecting the dynamical properties of the collisions. In this Letter, we present an unbiased approach to reconstruct proton-emitting sources from experimental correlation functions. Within an automatic differentiation framework, we parameterize the source functions with deep neural networks, to compute correlation functions. This approach achieves a lower chi-squared value compared to conventional Gaussian source functions and captures the long-tail behavior, in qualitative agreement with simulation predictions.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts Graph Transformers for Interpretable Particle Collision Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider at CERN produces immense volumes of complex data from high-energy particle collisions, demanding sophisticated analytical techniques for effective interpretation. Neural Networks, including Graph Neural Networks, have shown promise in tasks such as event classification and object identification by representing collisions as graphs. However, while Graph Neural Networks excel in predictive accuracy, their "black box" nature often limits their interpretability, making it difficult to trust their decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a Graph Transformer model with Mixture-of-Expert layers to achieve high predictive performance while embedding interpretability into the architecture. By leveraging attention maps and expert specialization, the model offers insights into its internal decision-making, linking predictions to physics-informed features. We evaluate the model on simulated events from the ATLAS experiment, focusing on distinguishing rare Supersymmetric signal events from Standard Model background. Our results highlight that the model achieves competitive classification accuracy while providing interpretable outputs that align with known physics, demonstrating its potential as a robust and transparent tool for high-energy physics data analysis. This approach underscores the importance of explainability in machine learning methods applied to high energy physics, offering a path toward greater trust in AI-driven discoveries.</description>
