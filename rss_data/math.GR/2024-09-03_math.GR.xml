      <title>A classification of finite groups with small Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. By a sequence over $G$, we mean a finite unordered string of terms from $G$ with repetition allowed, and we say that it is a product-one sequence if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity element of $G$. Then, the Davenport constant $\mathsf D (G)$ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence, that is a product-one sequence which cannot be partitioned into two non-trivial product-one subsequences. The Davenport constant is a combinatorial group invariant that has been studied fruitfully over several decades in additive combinatorics, invariant theory, and factorization theory, etc. Apart from a few cases of finite groups, the precise value of the Davenport constant is unknown. Even in the abelian case, little is known beyond groups of rank at most two. On the other hand, for a fixed positive integer $r$, structural results characterizing which groups $G$ satisfy $\mathsf D (G) = r$ are rare. We only know that there are finitely many such groups. In this paper, we study the classification of finite groups based on the Davenport constant.</description>

      <title>Normal extensions and full restricted semidirect products of inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the normal extensions of inverse semigroups isomorphic to full restricted semidirect products, and present a Kalouznin-Krasner theorem which holds for a wider class of normal extensions of inverse semigroups than that in the well-known embedding theorem due to Billhardt, and also strengthens that result in two respects. First, the wreath product construction applied in our result, and stemmming from Houghton's wreath product, is a full restricted semidirect product not merely a lambda-semidirect product. Second, the Kernel classes of our wreath product construction are direct products of some Kernel classes of the normal extension to be embedded rather than only inverse subsemigroups of the direct power of its whole Kernel.</description>

      <title>An inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle and applications to van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we give characterizations of the notions of van der Corput (vdC) set, nice vdC set and set of nice recurrence (defined below) in countable amenable groups. This allows us to prove that nice vdC sets are sets of nice recurrence and that vdC sets are independent of the F{\o}lner sequence used to define them, answering questions from Bergelson and Lesigne in the context of countable amenable groups. We also give a spectral characterization of vdC sets in abelian groups. The methods developed in this paper allow us to establish a converse to the Furstenberg correspondence principle. In addition, we introduce vdC sets in general non amenable groups and establish some basic properties of them, such as partition regularity.
  Several results in this paper, including the converse to Furstenberg's correspondence principle, have also been proved independently by Robin Tucker-Drob and Sohail Farhangi in their article `Van der Corput sets in amenable groups and beyond', which is being uploaded to arXiv simultaneously to this one.</description>

      <title>On derangements in simple permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G \leqslant {\rm Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group and recall that an element in $G$ is a derangement if it has no fixed points on $\Omega$. Let $\Delta(G)$ be the set of derangements in $G$ and define $\delta(G) = |\Delta(G)|/|G|$ and $\Delta(G)^2 = \{ xy \,:\, x,y \in \Delta(G)\}$. In recent years, there has been a focus on studying derangements in simple groups, leading to several remarkable results. For example, by combining a theorem of Fulman and Guralnick with recent work by Larsen, Shalev and Tiep, it follows that $\delta(G) \geqslant 0.016$ and $G = \Delta(G)^2$ for all sufficiently large simple transitive groups $G$. In this paper, we extend these results in several directions. For example, we prove that $\delta(G) \geqslant 89/325$ and $G = \Delta(G)^2$ for all finite simple primitive groups with soluble point stabilisers, without any order assumptions, and we show that the given lower bound on $\delta(G)$ is best possible. We also prove that every finite simple transitive group can be generated by two conjugate derangements, and we present several new results on derangements in arbitrary primitive permutation groups.</description>

      <title>Branch actions and the structure lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J. S. Wilson proved in 1971 an isomorphism between the structural lattice associated to a group belonging to his second class of groups with every proper quotient finite and the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of Cantor's ternary set. In this paper we generalize this isomorphism to the class of branch groups. Moreover, we show that for every faithful branch action of a group $G$ on a spherically homogeneous rooted tree $T$ there is a canonical $G$-equivariant isomorphism between the Boolean algebra associated with the structure lattice of $G$ and the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of the boundary of $T$.</description>

      <title>Double-coset zeta functions for groups acting on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the double-coset zeta functions for groups acting on trees, focusing mainly on weakly locally $\infty$-transitive or (P)-closed actions. After giving a geometric characterisation of convergence for the defining series, we provide explicit determinant formulae for the relevant zeta functions in terms of local data of the action. Moreover, we prove that evaluation at $-1$ satisfies the expected identity with the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of the group. The behaviour at $-1$ also sheds light on a connection with the Ihara zeta function of a weighted graph introduced by A. Deitmar.</description>

      <title>Non-C*-simple groups admit non-free actions on their Poisson boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a classical result of Kaimanovich and Vershik and independently of Rosenblatt that a non-amenable group admits a non-degenerate symmetric measure such that the Poisson boundary is trivial. Most if not all examples to date of non-free actions of countable groups on their Poisson boundaries had the stabilizers sitting inside the amenable radical. We show that every countable non-C*-simple group admits a symmetric measure of full support with non-trivial stabilizers. For a class of non-C*-simple groups with trivial amenable radical, which is non-empty as was shown by le Boudec, this gives a wealth of examples with non-normal stabilizers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the extension of the faithfulness question for the Burau representation of braid groups to the case of Artin--Tits groups. We prove that the Burau representation is not faithful in affine type $\tilde{A_3}$, and not faithful over several finite rings in type $D_4$, using an algorithmic approach based on categorical methods that generalize Bigelow's curve strategy outside of type $A$.</description>

      <title>Lifting Brauer indecomposability of a Scott module</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proven that if a finite group $G$ has a normal subgroup $H$ with $p'$-index (where $p$ is a prime) and $G/H$ is solvable, then for a $p$-subgroup $P$ of $H$, if the Scott $kH$-module with vertex $P$ is Brauer indecomposable, then so is the Scott $kG$-module with vertex $P$, where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. This has several applications.</description>

      <title>Limit Groups and Automorphisms of $\kappa$-Existentially Closed Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of automorphism groups of $\kappa$-existentially closed groups are studied
  by Kaya-Kuzucuo\u{g}lu in 2022.
  It was proved that Aut(G) is the union of subgroups of level preserving automorphisms and $|Aut(G)|=2^\kappa$
  whenever $\kappa$ is an inaccessible cardinal and $G$ is the unique
  $\kappa$-existentially closed group of
  cardinality $\kappa$. The cardinality of the automorphism group of a $\kappa$-existentially
  closed group of cardinality $\lambda&gt;\kappa$ is asked in Kourovka Notebook Question 20.40.
  Here we answer positively the promised case $\kappa=\lambda$ namely:
  If $G$ is a $\kappa$-existentially closed group of cardinality $\kappa$,
  then $|Aut(G)|=2^{\kappa}$. We also answer Kegel's question
  on universal groups, namely: For any uncountable cardinal $\kappa$,
  there exist universal groups of cardinality $\kappa$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $m$-location is a local combinatorial condition for flag simplicial complexes introduced by Osajda. Osajda showed that simply connected 8-located locally 5-large complexes are hyperbolic. We treat the nonpositive curvature case of 7-located locally 5-large complexes.
  We show that any minimal area disc diagram in a 7-located locally 5-large complex is itself 7-located and locally 5-large. We define a natural CAT(0) metric for 7-located disc diagrams and use this to prove that simply connected 7-located locally 5-large complexes have quadratic isoperimetric function. Along the way, we prove that locally weakly systolic complexes are 7-located locally 5-large.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic dynamics on amenable groups and van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergelson and Lesigne by showing that the notion of van der Corput set does not depend on the F\o lner sequence used to define it. This result has been discovered independently by Sa\'ul Rodr\'iguez Mart\'in. Both ours and Rodr\'iguez's proofs proceed by first establishing a converse to the Furstenberg Correspondence Principle for amenable groups.
  This involves studying the distributions of Reiter sequences over congruent sequences of tilings of the group.
  Lastly, we show that many of the equivalent characterizations of van der Corput sets in $\mathbb{N}$ that do not involve F\o lner sequences remain equivalent for arbitrary countably infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal roots, Macdonald representations, and quasiparabolic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a simply laced Weyl group of finite type and rank $n$. If $W$ has type $E_7$, $E_8$, or $D_n$ for $n$ even, then the root system of $W$ has subsystems of type $nA_1$. This gives rise to an irreducible Macdonald representation of $W$ spanned by $n$-roots, which are products of $n$ orthogonal roots in the symmetric algebra of the reflection representation. We prove that in these cases, the set of all maximal sets of orthogonal positive roots has the structure of a quasiparabolic set in the sense of Rains--Vazirani. The quasiparabolic structure can be described in terms of certain quadruples of orthogonal positive roots which we call crossings, nestings, and alignments. This leads to nonnesting and noncrossing bases for the Macdonald representation, as well as some highly structured partially ordered sets. We use the $8$-roots in type $E_8$ to give a concise description of a graph that is known to be non-isomorphic but quantum isomorphic to the orthogonality graph of the $E_8$ root system.</description>

      <title>Solvable Groups and Affine Actions on the Line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a structural result for orientation-preserving actions of finitely generated solvable groups on real intervals, considered up to semi-conjugacy. As applications we obtain new answers to a problem first considered by J. F. Plante, which asks under which conditions an action of a solvable group on a real interval is semi-conjugate to an action on the line by affine transformations. We show that this is always the case for actions by $C^1$ diffeomorphisms on closed intervals. For arbitrary actions by homeomorphisms, for which this result is no longer true (as shown by Plante), we show that a semi-conjugacy to an affine action still exists in a local sense, at the level of germs near the endpoints. Finally for a vast class of solvable groups, including all solvable linear groups, we show that the family of affine actions on the line is robust, in the sense that any action by homeomorphisms on the line which is sufficiently close to an affine action must be semi-conjugate to an affine action. This robustness fails for general solvable groups, as illustrated by a counterexample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two automorphisms of a group $G$, one is interested in knowing whether they are conjugate in the automorphism group of $G$, or in the abstract commensurator of $G$, and how these two properties may differ. When $G$ is the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface, we present a uniform finiteness theorem for the class of pseudo-Anosov automorphisms. We present an explicit example of a commensurably conjugate pair of pseudo-Anosov automorphisms of a genus $3$ surface, that are not conjugate in the Mapping Class Group, and we also show that infinitely many independent automorphisms of hyperbolic orbifolds have class number equal to one. In the appendix, we briefly survey the Latimer-MacDuffee theorem that addresses the case of automorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, with a point of view that is suited to an analogy with surface group automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Hopfian wreath products and the stable finiteness conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hopf property for wreath products of finitely generated groups, focusing on the case of an abelian base group. Our main result establishes a strong connection between this problem and Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture. Namely, the latter holds true if and only if for every finitely generated abelian group $A$ and every finitely generated Hopfian group $\Gamma$ the wreath product $A \wr \Gamma$ is Hopfian. In fact, we characterize precisely when $A \wr \Gamma$ is Hopfian, in terms of the existence of one-sided units in certain matrix algebras over $\mathbb{F}_p[\Gamma]$, for every prime $p$ occurring as the order of some element in $A$. A tool in our arguments is the fact that fields of positive characteristic locally embed into matrix algebras over $\mathbb{F}_p$ thus reducing the stable finiteness conjecture to the case of $\mathbb{F}_p$. A further application of this result shows that the validity of Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture is equivalent to a version of Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for additive cellular automata.</description>

      <title>A realisation result for moduli spaces of group actions on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03846v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated group $G$, the possible actions of $G$ on the real line (without global fixed points), considered up to semi-conjugacy, can be encoded by the space of orbits of a flow on a compact space $(Y, \Phi)$ naturally associated with $G$ and uniquely defined up to flow equivalence, that we call the \emph{Deroin space} of $G$. We show a realisation result: every expansive flow $(Y, \Phi)$ on a compact metrisable space of topological dimension 1, satisfying some mild additional assumptions, arises as the Deroin space of a finitely generated group. This is proven by identifying the Deroin space of an explicit family of groups acting on suspension flows of subshifts, which is a variant of a construction introduced by the second and fourth authors. This result provides a source of examples of finitely generated groups satisfying various new phenomena for actions on the line, related to their rigidity/flexibility properties and to the structure of (path-)connected components of the space of actions.</description>

      <title>Coarse group theoretic study on stable mixed commutator length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. We study the large scale behavior, not the exact values themselves, of the stable mixed commutator length $scl_{G,N}$ on the mixed commutator subgroup $[G,N]$; when $N=G$, $scl_{G,N}$ equals the stable commutator length $scl_G$ on the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$. For this purpose, we regard $scl_{G,N}$ not only as a function from $[G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, but as a bi-invariant metric function $d^+_{scl_{G,N}}$ from $[G,N]\times [G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Our main focus is coarse group theoretic structures of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$. Our preliminary result (the absolute version) connects, via the Bavard duality, $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$ and the quotient vector space of the space of $G$-invariant quasimorphisms on $N$ over one of such homomorphisms. In particular, we prove that the dimension of this vector space equals the asymptotic dimension of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$.
  Our main result is the comparative version: we connect the coarse kernel, formulated by Leitner and Vigolo, of the coarse homomorphism $\iota_{G,N}\colon ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})\to ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G}})$; $y\mapsto y$, and a certain quotient vector space $W(G,N)$ of the space of invariant quasimorphisms. Assume that $N=[G,G]$ and that $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional with dimension $\ell$. Then we prove that the coarse kernel of $\iota_{G,N}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ as a coarse group. In contrast to the absolute version, the space $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional in many cases, including all $(G,N)$ with finitely generated $G$ and nilpotent $G/N$. As an application of our result, given a group homomorphism $\varphi\colon G\to H$ between finitely generated groups, we define an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map `inside' the groups, which is dual to the naturally defined $\mathbb{R}$-linear map from $W(H,[H,H])$ to $W(G,[G,G])$ induced by $\varphi$.</description>

Abstract: In this review, we have reached from the most basic definitions in the theory of groups, group structures, etc. to representation theory and irreducible representations of the Poincar'e group. Also, we tried to get a more comprehensible understanding of group theory by presenting examples from the nature around us to examples in mathematics and physics and using them to examine more important groups in physics such as the Lorentz group and Poincar'e group and representations It is achieved in the physical fields that are used in the quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Statistically characterized subgroups related to some non-arithmetic sequence of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, in Das et al. (Mediterr. J. Math. 21 : 164, 2024), characterized subgroups are investigated for some special kind of non-arithmetic sequences. In this note, we study subsequent problems in case of ``statistically characterized subgroups" introduced in Dikranjan et al. (Fund. Math. 249 : 185-209, 2020). The entire investigation emphasizes that these statistically characterized subgroups are mostly larger in size, having cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$, and exhibit behavior that significantly differs from that of classically characterized subgroups. As a consequence, we solve an open problem raised in Dikranjan et al. (Fund. Math. 249 : 185-209, 2020).</description>

      <title>Orbits of permutation groups with no derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial finite permutation group of degree $n$. If $G$ is transitive, then a theorem of Jordan states that $G$ has a derangement. Equivalently, a finite group is never the union of conjugates of a proper subgroup. If $G$ is intransitive, then $G$ may fail to have a derangement, and this can happen even if $G$ has only two orbits, both of which have size $(1/2+o(1))n$. However, we conjecture that if $G$ has two orbits of size exactly $n/2$ then $G$ does have a derangement, and we prove this conjecture when $G$ acts primitively on at least one of the orbits. Equivalently, we conjecture that a finite group is never the union of conjugates of two proper subgroups of the same order, and we prove this conjecture when at least one of the subgroups is maximal. The same conjecture was implicitly made by Feldman. We prove other cases of the conjecture, and we highlight connections our results have with intersecting families of permutations and roots of polynomials modulo primes. Along the way, we also prove a linear variant on Isbell's conjecture regarding derangements of prime-power order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.04462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide characterizations of Anosov representations of word hyperbolic groups into real semisimple Lie groups in terms of the existence of equivariant limit maps on the Gromov boundary, the Cartan property and the uniform gap summation property introduced by Guichard-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel-Wienhard. We also study representations of finitely generated groups satisfying weak uniform gaps in eigenvalues and establish conditions to be Anosov. As an application, we also obtain a characterization of strongly convex cocompact subgroups of the projective linear group $\mathsf{PGL}_d(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>The ideal intersection property for essential groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise, in several complementary ways, \'etale groupoids with locally compact Hausdorff space of units whose essential groupoid C*-algebra has the ideal intersection property, assuming that the groupoid is topologically transitive and either Hausdorff or $\sigma$-compact. This leads directly to a characterisation of the simplicity of this C*-algebra which, for Hausdorff groupoids, agrees with the reduced groupoid C*-algebra. Specifically, we prove for topologically transitive groupoids that the ideal intersection property is equivalent to the absence of essentially confined amenable sections of isotropy groups. For topologically transitive groupoids with compact space of units we moreover show that this is equivalent to the uniqueness of equivariant pseudo-expectations. A key technical idea underlying our results is a new notion of groupoid action on C*-algebras including the essential groupoid C*-algebra itself. For minimal groupoids, we further obtain a relative version of Powers averaging property. Examples arise from suitable group representations into simple groupoid \Cstar-algebras. This is illustrated by the example of the quasi-regular representation of Thompson's group $\mathrm{T}$ with respect to Thompson's group $\mathrm{F}$, which satisfies the relative Powers averaging property in the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$.</description>

      <title>Connections and Finsler geometry of the structure group of a JB-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We endow the Banach-Lie structure group $Str(V)$ of an infinite dimensional JB-algebra $V$ with a left-invariant connection and Finsler metric, and we compute all the quantities of its connection. We show how this connection reduces to $G(\Omega)$, the group of transformations that preserve the positive cone $\Omega$ of the algebra $V$, and to $Aut(V)$, the group of Jordan automorphisms of the algebra. We present the cone $\Omega$ as an homogeneous space for the action of $G(\Omega)$, therefore inducing a quotient Finsler metric and distance. With the techniques introduced, we prove the minimality of the one-parameter groups in $\Omega$ for any symmetric gauge norm in $V$. We establish that the two presentations of the Finsler metric in $\Omega$ give the same distance there, which helps us prove the minimality of certain paths in $G(\Omega)$ for its left-invariant Finsler metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider diffeomorphism groups of manifolds with smooth boundary. We show that the diffeomorphism groups of the manifold and its boundary fit into a short exact sequence which admits local sections. In other words, they form an infinite-dimensional fibre bundle. Manifolds with boundary are of interest in numerical analysis and with a view towards applications in machine learning we establish controllability results for families of vector fields. This generalises older results due to Agrachev and Caponigro in the boundary-less case. Our results show in particular that the diffeomorphism group of a manifold with smooth boundary is generated by the image of the exponential map.</description>

Abstract: We prove a duality theorem for Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes. This is a generalisation of Poincar\'e Duality, framed in the language of combinatorial sheaves. Our treatment is self-contained and accessible for readers with a working knowledge of simplicial complexes and (co)homology. The main motivation is a link with Bieri-Eckmann duality for discrete groups, which is explored in a companion paper.</description>

These equations can be used to construct some groups of exponent $p^n$. These groups, as well as others of exponent $p^{n+1}$, explain why $p=2$ is not really an exceptional prime in relation to the Heisenberg group over the field with $p$ elements.</description>
