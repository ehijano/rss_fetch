      <title>Unconventional Spintronics from Chiral Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic devices typically employ heterostructures with ferromagnets which break time-reversal symmetry and have non-vanishing magnetization. With the growing class of materials that support spin-polarized carriers, current, and excitations,it is possible to envision emerging spintronic applications that are not limited to magnetoresistance. Here we focus on chiral perovskites with no net magnetization where the space-inversion and mirror symmetries are broken to induce chiral structure. The known importance of these perovskites is further expanded by the demonstration of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, the generation of the spin-polarized carriers across the interface with these chiral perovskites remains to be fully understood. Our first-principles studies for two-dimensional PbBr$_4$-based chiral perovskites provide their electronic structure and an orbital-based symmetry analysis, which allows us to establish an effective Hamiltonian to elucidate the underlying origin of their chirality. We also use this analysis for the Edelstein effect, responsible for electrical generation of the nonequilibrium spin polarization in many materials, which in chiral perovskites could be a mechanism contributing to CISS. Furthermore, by examining optical properties of chiral perovskites and the opportunity to use them to realize tunable altermagnets, another class of zero-magnetization spintronic materials, we put forth a versatile materials platform for unconventional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Engineering Quantum Wire States for Atom Scale Circuitry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput NEB for Li-Ion Conductor Discovery via Fine-Tuned CHGNet Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes are essential in the development of all-solid-state batteries. While density functional theory (DFT)-based nudged elastic band (NEB) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods provide fundamental insights on lithium-ion migration barriers and ionic conductivity, their computational costs make large-scale materials exploration challenging. In this study, we developed a high-throughput NEB computational framework integrated with the fine-tuned universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), enabling accelerated prediction of migration barriers based on transition state theory for the efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors. This framework automates the construction of initial/final states and migration paths, mitigating the inaccurate barriers prediction in pretrained potentials due to the insufficient training data on high-energy states. We employed the fine-tuned CHGNet model into NEB/MD calculations and the dual CHGNet-NEB/MD achieves a balance between computational speed and accuracy, as validated in NASICON-type Li$_{1+x}$Al$_x$Ti$_{2-x}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ (LATP) structures. Through high-throughput screening, we identified orthorhombic Pnma-group structures (LiMgPO$_4$, LiTiPO$_5$, etc.) which can serve as promising frameworks for fast ion conductors. Their aliovalent-doped variants, Li$_{0.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$PO$_4$ and Li$_{0.5}$TiPO$_{4.5}$F$_{0.5}$, were predicted to possess low activation energies, as well as high ionic conductivity of 0.19 mS/cm and 0.024 mS/cm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Time- and Polarization-Resolved Extreme Ultraviolet Momentum Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of an instrument combining an ultrafast, high-repetition-rate, polarization-tunable monochromatic extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 21.6 eV) beamline and a next-generation momentum microscope endstation. This setup enables time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of quantum materials, offering multimodal photoemission dichroism capabilities. The momentum microscope simultaneously detects the full surface Brillouin zone over an extended binding energy range. It is equipped with advanced electron optics, including a new type of front lens that supports multiple operational modes. Enhanced spatial resolution is achieved by combining the small XUV beam footprint (33 $\mu$m by 45 $\mu$m) with the selection of small regions of interest using apertures positioned in the Gaussian plane of the momentum microscope. This instrument achieves an energy resolution of 44 meV and a temporal resolution of 144 fs. We demonstrate the capability to perform linear, Fourier, and circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions from photoexcited 2D materials. This functionality paves the way for time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved investigations of orbital and quantum geometrical properties underlying electronic structures of quantum materials driven out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce N\'eel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</description>

      <title>Triboelectric charge transfer theory driven by interfacial thermoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive study and the practical significance of friction-driven static electricity, a quantitative triboelectric charge transfer theory has yet to be established. Here, we elucidate the detailed dynamics of triboelectric charge transfer driven by interfacial thermoelectric bias maintaining a steady state at the interface. We demonstrate that triboelectric charge exists in a delta-like distribution at a steady state. We suggest that the transferred triboelectric charge is dictated by half of the difference between thermoelectrically induced surface charges. Moreover, we quantitatively discuss electrostatic adhesion and static discharge between the transferred charges, which we may experience every day, including the role of surface charge inhomogeneity. Our findings may have significant implications for applications ranging from static electricity phenomena to advanced energy harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Radiation stability of nanocomposite scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole tunnelling probed in de Haas - van Alphen oscillations in the (double) Dirac semimetal NbTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NbTe$_4$ undergoes multiple charge density wave transitions that have attracted great interest in this material for decades. Previous work has shown that the crystal obtains the space group P4/ncc (130) at temperatures below 50K which allows for the existence of eightfold degenerate double Dirac points in the band structure. We provide insights into the electronic structure of this material through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and a rotation study of de Haas - van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations in the magnetic torque. We find that NbTe$_4$ exhibits magnetic breakdown orbits between electron and hole pockets.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum oscillation measurements in the Dirac nodal-line semimetal TaNiTe$_5$ which exhibit a strongly enhanced amplitude in the magnetoresistance. We show that mechanical properties of the measurement setup in combination with de Haas - van Alphen oscillations in the magnetic torque can cause this enhancement in the measured resistance, without involvement of any topological properties in this material. To support the empirical data, a numerical model is provided, showing good agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lactose is widely used in agri-food and pharma industries. New materials that can be obtained from renewable sources are currently being sought. I have studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure on structural properties of currently known forms of crystalline lactose within the framework of density functional theory with van der Waals interactions. The computed parameters have good agreement with experimental data. The effect of mechanical deformations on electron structure of crystalline lactose was also studied. Compression of the crystal leads to the band gap increase. The analysis of partial density of states of lactose crystals was performed. The band gap of different forms of crystalline lactose was also computed using the quasiparticle G0W0 approximation.</description>

      <title>Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Mapping of Anisotropic Thermal Transport in GaN Thin Films via Ultrafast X-ray Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is essential for the reliability of modern power electronics, where increasing device density leads to severe heat dissipation challenges. However, in thin-film systems, thermal transport is often compromised by interfacial resistance and microscale defects introduced during synthesis or transfer, which are difficult to characterize using conventional techniques. Here we present a non-contact, spatiotemporal-resolved ultrafast x-ray diffraction method to extract in-plane thermal conductivity and thermal boundary conductance, using GaN thin films on silicon as a model system. By tracking the pump-induced lattice strain, we reconstruct the lateral heat flow dynamics and quantitatively probe thermal transport near a wrinkle defect. We uncover pronounced asymmetric heat dissipation across the wrinkle, with a four-fold reduction in the local thermal conductivity near the wrinkle and a 25% drop in interfacial conductance. Our work demonstrates that ultrafast x-ray diffraction can serve as a precise thermal metrology tool for characterizing heat transport in multilayered thin-film structures for next-generation microelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Electronic Properties of Monoclinic (InxAl1-x)2O3 Alloys via Substitutional Donors and Acceptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</description>

      <title>Prediction of synthesis parameters for N, Si, Ge and Sn diamond vacancy centers using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers, including worldwide trends in fabrication techniques and processes. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.</description>

Abstract: Many viscous liquids behave effectively as incompressible under high pressures but display a pronounced dependence of viscosity on pressure. The classical incompressible Navier-Stokes model cannot account for both features, and a simple pressure-dependent modification introduces questions about the well-posedness of the resulting equations. This paper presents the first study of a second-gradient extension of the incompressible Navier-Stokes model, recently introduced by the authors, which includes higher-order spatial derivatives, pressure-sensitive viscosities, and complementary boundary conditions. Focusing on steady flow down an inclined plane, we adopt Barus' exponential law and impose weak adherence at the lower boundary and a prescribed ambient pressure at the free surface. Through numerical simulations, we examine how the flow profile varies with the angle of inclination, ambient pressure, viscosity sensitivity to pressure, and internal length scale.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry in the NbSe$_2$ Family I: Obstructed Compact Wannier Function and New Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Nonreciprocal Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional disordered block subwavelength resonator systems subject to nonreciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.</description>

      <title>Coercivity-size map of magnetic nanoflowers: spin disorder tunes the vortex reversal mechanism and tailors the hyperthermia sweet spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron-oxide nanoflowers (NFs) are one of the most efficient nanoheaters for magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT). However, the physics underlying the spin texture of disordered iron-oxide nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit remains still poorly understood. Using large-scale micromagnetic simulations we completely map the magnetization of NFs over an unprecedented size range, from 10 to 400 nm in diameter, connecting their microstructure to their macroscopic magnetic response. Above the single domain (d &gt; 50 nm), the magnetization folds into a vortex state, within which the coercivity describes a secondary maximum, not present for non-disordered nanoparticles. We have extended our understanding by resolving also the NF magnetization dynamics, capturing the physics of the magnetization reversal. Within the vortex regime, two distinct reversal modes exist: i) A core-dominated one, in which the core immediately switches along the direction of the applied field, resulting in an increasing coercivity for larger sizes; and ii) a flux-closure dominated reversal mode, going through the perpendicular alignment of the vortex core to the field, resulting in a decreasing coercivity-size dependence. The coercivity maximum is located at the transition between both reversal modes, and results from the combination of grain anisotropy and grain-boundary pinning: weak (but non-negligible) inter-grain exchange keeps the vortex profile coherent, yet allows the core to be pinned by the random anisotropy easy axes of the single grains, maximizing magnetic losses. Our results provide the first full description of spin textures in iron oxide NFs beyond the macrospin framework, and clarify the role of internal spin disorder in magnetic hyperthermia heating. By adjusting the grain size, the coercivity "sweet spot" can be tailored, offering a practical route to next-generation, high-efficiency nanoheaters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use symmetry arguments to show that the matrix elements of electron-electron interaction on a lattice reach extrema in states composed of wavevectors near high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. The mechanism is illustrated by minimal models of cuprates and Fe-based superconductors, where this dependence originates from the wavevector-dependent orbital composition of wavefunctions. We discuss how these dependences can facilitate finite-momentum pairing. Our results provide symmetry-based guidance for the search for new high-temperature superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Topological nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) are a new family of topological materials characterized by electronic band crossings that form lines in the Brillouin zone. These NLSMs host exotic nodal-line structures and exhibit distinct features such as drumhead surface states and unique electromagnetic responses. This review classifies various NLSM types based on their nodal structures and protecting symmetries, highlighting that these nodal-line structures can form links, knots, and chains. We discuss their characteristic electromagnetic responses, including Landau level spectroscopy, optical conductivity, and permittivity. Furthermore, the strong correlation effects in these NLSMs modify their semimetallic phases and lead to novel quantum phases where magnetism and superconductivity intertwine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Activation entropy of dislocation glide in body-centered cubic metals from atomistic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The activation entropy of dislocation glide, a key process controlling the strength of many metals, is often assumed to be constant or linked to enthalpy through the empirical Meyer-Neldel law-both of which are simplified approximations. In this study, we take a more direct approach by calculating the activation Gibbs energy for kink-pair nucleation on screw dislocations of two body-centered cubic metals, iron and tungsten. To ensure reliability, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials for both metals, carefully trained on dislocation data from density functional theory. Our findings reveal that dislocations undergo harmonic transitions between Peierls valleys, with an activation entropy that remains largely constant, regardless of temperature or applied stress. We use these results to parameterize a thermally-activated model of yield stress, which consistently matches experimental data in both iron and tungsten. Our work challenges recent studies using classical potentials, which report highly varying activation entropies, and suggests that simulations relying on classical potentials-widely used in materials modeling-could be significantly influenced by overestimated entropic effects.</description>

      <title>The impact of morphological structure and flexo-chemical strains on the electric transport mechanisms in the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00603v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric conduction mechanisms are studied in the pressed nanoflake powder of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) depending on their content and structure. The MoSxOy nanoflakes were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. The sintered nanoflakes are 10-20 nm thick and self-assembled in the "nanoflower"-shape aggregates forming powder particles. The chemical composition and structure of the powders were studied by XPS, EDS and Raman spectroscopy, which show that the powders have different chemical composition and structure depending on the preparation conditions. These studies revealed the existence of different forms of MoS2 and its oxides in the powders. These features are impactful on electric transport properties. The current-voltage (I-V) curves of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal hysteresis-like behavior; at that the loop width depends on the chemical composition and structure. The negative differential conductivity is observed for the highest content of Mo in oxide/sulfoxide form. The I-V curves of all MoSxOy nanoflake samples manifest the three-state resistive switching and the long-lasting transient charge/discharge on switching "on/off" the voltage across the sample, which evidences the role of interface charges in their conductivity. To describe theoretically the observed I-V curves, polar and electric-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, the Landau-Cahn-Hilliard approach considering flexo-chemical field has been used. The revealed experimentally and explained theoretically features of resistive switching and charge accumulation look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>Tunable altermagnetism via inter-chain engineering in parallelassembled atomic chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently drawn considerable attention in three- and twodimensional materials. Here, we extend this concept to quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) monolayers assembled from single-atomic magnetic chains. Through systematically examining nine types of structures, two stacking orders, and intra-/inter-chain magnetic couplings, we identify four out of thirty promising structural prototypes for hosting altermagnetism, which yields 192 potential monolayer materials. We further confirm eight thermodynamically stable Q1D monolayers via high-throughput calculations. Using symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we find that the existence of altermagnetism is determined by the type of inter-chain magnetic coupling and predict three intrinsic altermagnets,\(CrBr_3\),\(VBr_3\),\(MnBr_3\),due to their ferromagnetic inter-chain couplings and five extrinsic ones,\(CrF_3\),\(CrCl_3\),\(CrI_3\),\(FeCl_3\)and \(CoTe_3\), ascribed to their neglectable or antiferromagnetic inter-chain couplings. Moreover, the inter-chain magnetic coupling here is highly tunable by manipulating the inter-chain spacing, leading to experimentally feasible transitions between altermagnetic and nodal-line semiconducting states. In addition, applying external electric fields can further modulate the spin splitting. Our findings establish a highly tunable family of Q1D altermagnets, offering fundamental insights into the intricate relationship between geometry, electronic structure, and magnetism.These discoveries hold significant promises for experimental realization and future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Interstitials as a key ingredient for P segregation to grain boundaries in polycrystalline $\alpha$-Fe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</description>

Abstract: Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to 52% among more than one thousand candidate fragments. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.</description>

      <title>Nine circles of elastic brittle fracture: A series of challenge problems to assess fracture models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.</description>
