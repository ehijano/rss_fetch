      <title>Clustering Confuses Spectro-photometry: An Investigation of 2D and 3D Forced Profile Matching for Stacking Line-intensity Mapping Data on Source Catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging observational technique that is used to observe the universe on large scales at low resolution through spectral line emission. Stacking analyses coadd cutouts of LIM data on positions of known signal emitters, robustly detecting signal otherwise hidden in a noisy map. In this article, we present two augmentations of a stacking pipeline, both aiming to refine the sensitivity of the stack by assuming a specific observed signal shape in 2D spatial axes or 3D spatial and spectral axes, as well as stacking on source coordinates more precise than the resolution of the LIM data cube. We test these methods on a series of simplistic and complex simulations mimicking observations with the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder. We find that these fitting methods provide up to a 25% advantage in detection significance over the original stack method in realistic COMAP-like simulations. We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias.</description>

      <title>A Generative Reconstruction of Low-$\ell$ CMB B-Mode Signal using Reverse Diffusion in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting primordial B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides a direct probe of inflationary gravitational waves. However, the signal is extremely faint and contaminated by gravitational lensing, instrumental noise, and astrophysical foregrounds. Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes within Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) during the radiation-dominated era. The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $\sigma(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $\beta(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number.</description>

      <title>A new path to constrain the expansion history of the Universe in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current tension between early- and late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), along with the still elusive nature of dark matter and dark energy, calls for model-independent probes of the Universe's expansion history. The cosmic chronometers (CC) method offers a unique opportunity to directly measure the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ without relying on any cosmological model assumptions or integrated distance measurements. Despite its potential, this technique remains statistics-limited: no current survey is optimized to detect large samples of CC, restricting the precision on $H(z)$ to $\sim$20% at intermediate redshifts. Here, we investigate the opportunities that a next-generation spectroscopic facility could offer to CC studies, providing an estimate of the accuracy achievable on the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter in redshift. We demonstrate that with such a facility, it will be possible to derive constraints on key cosmological parameters, assessing the impact that such improvements would have on our understanding of the expansion history of the Universe and on current cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Three channel dissipative warm Higgs inflation with global inference via genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs and analyzes a three channel dissipative framework for Warm Higgs Inflation, wherein the total dissipation coefficient, $\Upsilon(h,T)$, is decomposed into low temperature, high temperature, and threshold activated contributions. A genetic algorithm is employed for the global numerical solution and statistical inference of the background field dynamics. To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \equiv \Upsilon/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency. The complete workflow is demonstrated on a $14$ dimensional phenomenological model. An ablation study of the priors (\texttt{noprior} vs. \texttt{mixing} vs. \texttt{mixing+entropy}) yields $18871$ viable parameter points, revealing that the priors significantly enhance the discovery probability of non-trivial multi channel solutions within a parameter space naturally biased towards single channel dominance. After imposing the observational constraint $r &lt; 0.036$, the number of retained solutions for each scenario is $14485$, $1889$, and $1971$, respectively. A typical best fit solution exhibits a "channel relay" dynamical feature during its evolution and a genuinely mixed state at the pivot scale (e.g., $f_{{\rm HT},*}\simeq 0.399480$, $f_{{\rm th},*}\simeq 0.600517$), implying that the microscopic origin of dissipation need not be unique within a single inflationary history.</description>

      <title>Quenching pathways in the green valley at low redshift: confronting SDSS AGN hosts with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare low-redshift ($z&lt;0.1$) BPT-selected pure optical AGN hosts in SDSS DR7 to colour-selected "green-valley" analogue central galaxies in IllustrisTNG100 and EAGLE Ref-L0100N1504. To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)&gt;10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc). SDSS hosts are linked to the MPA-JHU catalogue for stellar masses and aperture-corrected total SFRs. TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-14.85$ ($\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts. All catalogues and analysis scripts are publicly released.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from seesaw assisted collapsing domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries like $Z_2$ leads to the formation of stable topological defects such as domain walls which, if allowed to dominate, can potentially be in conflict with cosmological observations. Incorporating explicit $Z_2$-breaking bias terms can lead to annihilation of such walls while also emitting stochastic gravitational wave (GW). We study the role of heavy right-handed neutrinos present in type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino masses to generate such bias term via quantum corrections. This offers interesting correlation among the seesaw scale, GW peak amplitude and peak frequency which can be probed at present and future experiments related to GW as well as precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In flavor symmetric UV complete scenarios with degenerate RHNs at leading order, such tiny coupling of RHNs to a $Z_2$-odd scalar can also lead to small mass splittings suitable for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via resonant leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Cosmological long-wavelength solutions in non-adiabatic multi-fluid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formulation of nonlinear cosmological perturbations on superhorizon scales in multi-fluid systems. It is based on the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism combined with a spatial gradient expansion characterized by a small expansion parameter defined as the ratio of the comoving wavenumber to the Hubble scale. The background spacetime is assumed to be a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. Within this framework, we explicitly construct nonlinear long-wavelength solutions for cosmological perturbations. Since multi-fluid systems are inherently non-adiabatic, these solutions admit both adiabatic and entropy modes already at leading nonlinear order. We define adiabatic and entropy perturbations and discuss the non-uniqueness in defining pure entropy perturbations. Using different choices of pure entropy initial conditions, we analyze the time evolution of physical quantities such as the curvature perturbation and density perturbations in the geodesic slicing for two-fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh Cosmological Cutting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.</description>

      <title>Heavy dark matter in rapidly evolving massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of heavy dark matter (DM) captured in massive stars via scattering(s) with the star constituents. We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effective parameter space associated with the axion mass and the axion decay constant in both the light and heavy QCD axion scenarios. We initiate our discussion by considering the simplest case of two axions, quantitatively analyzing the parameter space in these two distinct scenarios. We find that the axion mass ratios exhibit a high degree of similarity in these two situations. In contrast, the ratios of axion decay constants display a complete opposition. Furthermore, we generalize our conclusions to encompass the case of multiple axions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Noether-Ward identities for scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Noether-Ward identities for the evolution of general metric perturbations on quantum matter backgrounds. In this work we consider Einstein's gravity covariantly coupled to a massive, non-minimally coupled, quantum scalar field in general curved backgrounds. We find that each term in the equation of motion for gravitational perturbations satisfies its own Noether-Ward identity. Even though each term is non-transverse, the whole equation of motion maintains transversality. In particular, each counterterm needed to renormalize the graviton self-energy satisfies its own Noether identity, and we derive the explicit form for each. Finally, in order to understand how the Noether-Ward identities are affected by the definition of the metric perturbation, we consider two inequivalent definitions of metric perturbations and derive the Noether-Ward identities for both definitions. This implies that there are Noether-Ward identities for every definition of the metric perturbation.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Law to Reproduce the Galaxy Rotation Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Profiles of galaxy's rotation velocity (rotation curves) remain unexpectedly flat at large distances, where visible matter alone should make the rotation speed decrease with radius. The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $\Phi_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $\rho_b$ generates an additional energy density $\rho_s = \mu_s \Phi_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $\Phi_{\rm tot}$, \[ \nabla^2\Phi_{\rm tot} = 4\pi G\,\rho_b /c^2 + 4\pi G\,\mu_s\,\Phi_b^2 / c^6. \] When assuming $\mu_s = K M_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database. The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied.</description>

Abstract: Direct dark matter detection experiments search for rare signals induced by hypothetical, galactic dark matter particles in low-background detectors operated deep underground. I will briefly review the direct detection principles, the expected signals and backgrounds, and the main experimental techniques. I will then discuss the status of ongoing experiments aiming to discover new particles in the keV - TeV mass range, as well as future detectors and their sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Predicting large scale cosmological structure evolution with generative adversarial network-based autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Predicting the nonlinear evolution of cosmic structure from initial conditions is typically approached using Lagrangian, particle-based methods. These techniques excel in terms of tracking individual trajectories, but they might not be suitable for applications where point-based information is unavailable or impractical. In this work, we explore an alternative, field-based approach using Eulerian inputs. Specifically, we developed an autoencoder architecture based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) and trained it to evolve density fields drawn from dark matter N-body simulations. We tested this method on both 2D and 3D data. We find that while predictions on 2D density maps perform well based on density alone, accurate 3D predictions require the inclusion of associated velocity fields. Our results demonstrate the potential of field-based representations to model cosmic structure evolution, offering a complementary path to Lagrangian methods in contexts where field-level data is more accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal infrared gravitational reheating in light of ACT observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} &gt; 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi&gt;1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest from LBGs: First 3D Correlation Measurement with DESI and Prospects for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest is a key tracer of large-scale structure at redshifts z &gt; 2, traditionally studied using spectra of quasars. Here, we explore the viability Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as alternative background sources for Ly$\alpha$ forest studies. We analyze 4,151 Ly$\alpha$ forest skewers extracted from LBG spectra obtained in the DESI pilot surveys in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function derived exclusively from LBG spectra, probing comoving separations up to 48 $h^{-1}$Mpc at an effective redshift of $z_\mathrm{eff}$ = 2.70. The measured signal is consistent with that from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift, validating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the cross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy positions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for galaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic LBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over 5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than our dataset, could enable Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the anisotropic (Alcock-Paczynski) scale. Combining BAO with a Ly$\alpha$ forest full-shape analysis improves the AP constraint to 0.6%. These results open a new path for precision cosmology at high redshift using dense LBG samples.</description>

      <title>Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</description>

      <title>A Unified Photometric Redshift Calibration for Weak Lensing Surveys using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective redshift distribution $n(z)$ of galaxies is a critical component in the study of weak gravitational lensing. Here, we introduce a new method for determining $n(z)$ for weak lensing surveys based on high-quality redshifts and neural network-based importance weights. Additionally, we present the first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain $n(z)$ constraints with statistical uncertainties of order $\sigma_{\bar z} \sim 0.01$ and smaller. Our analysis is largely independent of previous photometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check in light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations with DESI data.</description>

      <title>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation and the Latest CMB Data: A Subtle Tension?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Scalar Field Model for Dark Energy: Addressing the Hubble Tension and Cosmic Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical dark energy model based on a canonical scalar field with a hybrid potential of the form $V(\phi) = V_{0}e^{-\lambda\phi} + V_{1}\phi^{n}$. We constrain the model's 11-dimensional parameter space using a comprehensive combination of cosmological data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the Pantheon+ supernova sample, SH0ES and the matter power spectrum from SDSS. The model provides an excellent fit to the data, with a reduced chi-squared of $\chi^2_{\text{red}} = 0.989$, while successfully alleviating the Hubble constant tension. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 \approx 72.820$ km/s/Mpc, reducing the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements. We find that the data favors a 'thawing' quintessence scenario, characterized by a potential slope parameter $\lambda \approx 0.056$. This small but non-zero slope drives a late-time deviation from $\Lambda$CDM ($w(z=0) \approx -0.85$) while preserving the standard expansion history at high redshifts. A model comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion finds that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is still slightly preferred ($\Delta\text{BIC} = 2.178$) due to its fewer parameters. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that this hybrid potential model is a compelling, physically motivated alternative to a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Connecting clustering and the cosmic web:Observational constraints on secondary halo bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\rm relative}$ ranging from $\sim 1.2$ for the 15\% reddest centrals to $\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\% of environments reach $b_{\rm relative} \sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\rm relative} \sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.</description>

      <title>The Evolving Baryonic Tully Fisher Relation: A Universal Law from Galaxies to Galactic Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) links the baryonic mass of galaxies to their characteristic rotational velocity and has been shown to hold with remarkable precision across a wide mass range. Recent studies, however, indicate that galaxy clusters occupy a parallel but offset relation, raising questions about the universality of the BTFR. Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs. Our results unify mass-velocity scaling across five orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, offering new insights into cosmic structure formation.</description>

Abstract: Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\Omega_1\Omega_2}$-$\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM: A promising phenomenological extension of the standard model of cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a phenomenological extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework and contributes two additional terms, $\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, in the dark energy sector, alongside the cosmological constant, leading to a physically interpretable and observationally testable dynamics of effective dark energy. Using Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, we find that the model allows increased freedom in the late-time expansion history while preserving the standard early-universe physics. When DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data are included in the analysis, the inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 69.74 \pm 0.77~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL), which is consistent with recent Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) measurements from the Carnegie--Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP). The reconstructed dark energy equation of state exhibits a smooth transition across the phantom divide followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior, leading to modified late-time dynamics of universe while maintaining standard early-time cosmology. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM can improve cosmological concordance.</description>

      <title>Dynamical de Sitter conjecture and quintessence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

      <title>Search for a photon peak from keV-scale dark matter annihilation with NuSTAR: Constraints on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ after 11 years of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints on the velocity-independent annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ of keV-scale dark matter particles based on 11 years of observations with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope. Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.</description>

      <title>Light thermal dark matter models in the light of DAMIC-M 2025 constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM charged under a new Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)$, we outline two possibilities: (i) family non-universal $U(1)$ gauge coupling with resonantly enhanced DM annihilation into standard model (SM) fermions and (ii) family universal dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry where relic is set by DM annihilation into light gauge bosons. As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Multi-Component Axion Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mechanism for multi-component dark matter (DM) that originates from axion mixing and present some of its defining properties. In this context, multi-component DM implies that the cold DM is composed of the QCD axion and many ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs). This framework can be realized in the type IIB string axiverse with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants. Our investigation reveals that in the light QCD axion scenario, the energy density of the lightest ALP often dominates after mixing. On the other hand, in the heavy QCD axion scenario, both the QCD axion and non-lightest ALPs may dominate, depending on the ALP decay constants. Under certain conditions, the QCD axion can dominate the DM budget. Finally, we briefly discuss a theoretical framework featuring $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ axions, with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants.</description>

      <title>Higher Curvature Inflation and the Species Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scalar potentials that arise from higher curvature corrections in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity and their connection to a dynamical species scale. Starting from general considerations in arbitrary dimensions, we show that at large field values, the scalar potential generated by an infinite series of curvature terms and the field dependent species scale arising from circle compactification both decay exponentially, in complementary ways. We identify conditions under which these two effects precisely balance out, giving rise to exponentially flat, plateau-like potentials. We additionally find a precise embedding of Starobinsky inflation consistent with the Swampland program, and we discuss possible implications the mechanism proposed could have for M and string theory.</description>

      <title>Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.
  One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).
  In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that "similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>A Search for Hard X-ray/Soft $\gamma$-ray Emission from SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) Using INTEGRAL/ISGRI</title>

Abstract: We present a search for hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell~3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations. This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the hard X-ray to soft $\gamma$-ray regime. We searched for emission in the 30--300~keV energy range using the INTEGRAL Off-line scientific analysis software with a total effective exposure of 2817 s. No significant emission was detected at the cluster position in the aforementioned energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3\sigma$ upper limit of $F_{30-100\,\mathrm{keV}} &lt; 4.4 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. This limit rules out bright IC scenarios and constrains the efficiency of merger-driven particle acceleration in SPT-CL J2012-5649. Our results provide the most stringent soft $\gamma$-ray constraint on this system to date and highlight the need for next-generation hard X-ray missions, such as HEX-P or eXTP, to probe IC emission at theoretically predicted levels in merging clusters.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Between Black Hole Mass and Dark Matter Halo Concentration in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a positive correlation between supermassive black hole mass and dark matter halo concentration at fixed halo mass in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Analyzing central galaxies in TNG100 (N = 18,954), EAGLE (N = 1,522), and CAMELS-TNG (N = 6,664), we find partial correlation coefficients of r = +0.24, +0.34, and +0.66 respectively, all highly significant (p &lt; 10^-10). The correlation is absent in SIMBA (r = +0.01, p = 0.09), which employs a torque-limited black hole accretion model rather than the Bondi-based prescription used by the other simulations. Both TNG and EAGLE exhibit a mass-dependent sign transition: the correlation is negative or null at log(M200/Msun) &lt; 11.5 but strongly positive at higher masses. We interpret this pattern as reflecting the coupling between Bondi accretion rates and central gas density structure: halos with higher concentration have denser cores, enabling more efficient black hole growth at fixed halo mass. The absence of the correlation in torque-limited models supports this interpretation. These results suggest that halo concentration may be a fundamental parameter governing black hole-galaxy coevolution.</description>
