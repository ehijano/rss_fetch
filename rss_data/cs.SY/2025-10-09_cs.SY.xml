      <title>Auctioning Future Services in Edge Networks with Moving Vehicles: N-Step Look-Ahead Contracts for Sustainable Resource Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely resource allocation in edge-assisted vehicular networks is essential for compute-intensive services such as autonomous driving and navigation. However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading. Experiments on real-world (UTD19) and synthetic traces demonstrate that our method improves time efficiency, energy use, and social welfare compared with existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear System Identification for Model-Based Control of Waked Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a nonlinear system identification framework for modeling the power extraction dynamics of wind turbines, including both freestream and waked conditions. The approach models turbine dynamics using data-driven power coefficient maps expressed as combinations of compact radial basis functions and polynomial bases, parameterized in terms of tip-speed ratio and upstream conditions. These surrogate models are embedded in a first-order dynamic system suitable for model-based control. Experimental validation is carried out in two wind tunnel configurations: a low-turbulence tandem setup and a high-turbulence wind farm scenario. In the tandem case, the identified model is integrated into an adapted K\omega^2 controller, resulting in improved tip-speed ratio tracking and power stability compared to BEM-based and steady-state models. In the wind farm scenario, the model captures the statistical behavior of the turbines despite unresolved turbulence. The proposed method enables interpretable, adaptive control across a range of operating conditions without relying on black-box learning strategies.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control Allocation for Underactuated Time-Scale Separated Non-Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many robotic systems are underactuated, meaning not all degrees of freedom can be directly controlled due to lack of actuators, input constraints, or state-dependent actuation. This property, compounded by modeling uncertainties and disturbances, complicates the control design process for trajectory tracking. In this work, we propose an adaptive control architecture for uncertain, nonlinear, underactuated systems with input constraints. Leveraging time-scale separation, we construct a reduced-order model where fast dynamics provide virtual inputs to the slower subsystem and use dynamic control allocation to select the optimal control inputs given the non-affine dynamics. To handle uncertainty, we introduce a state predictor-based adaptive law, and through singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis, we prove stability and bounded tracking of reference trajectories. The proposed method is validated on a VTOL quadplane with nonlinear, state-dependent actuation, demonstrating its utility as a unified controller across various flight regimes, including cruise, landing transition, and hover.</description>

      <title>Some Reflections on Sliding Mode Designs in Control Systems: An Example of Adaptive Tracking Control for Simple Mechanical Systems With Friction Without Measurement of Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this note is to share some reflections of the authors regarding the use of sliding mode designs in control systems. We believe the abundant, and ever increasing, appearance of this kind of works on our scientific publications deserves some critical evaluation of their actual role, relevance and pertinence. First, we discuss the procedure followed by most of these designs -- illustrated with examples from the literature. Second, we bring to the readers attention several aspects of the control problem, central in classical designs, which are disregarded in the sliding mode literature. Finally, to illustrate with an specific example our previous considerations, we compare the performance of two adaptive tracking controllers for a simple one degree of freedom mechanical systems with unknown parameters and static and Coulomb friction -- that do not rely on the measurement of velocity.</description>

      <title>Space Logistics Analysis and Incentive Design for Commercialization of Orbital Debris Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As orbital debris continues to become a higher priority for the space industry, there is a need to explore how partnerships between the public and private space sector may aid in addressing this issue. This research develops a space logistics framework for planning orbital debris remediation missions, providing a quantitative basis for partnerships that are mutually beneficial between space operators and debris remediators. By integrating network-based space logistics and game theory, we illuminate the high-level costs of remediating orbital debris, and the surplus that stands to be shared as a result. These findings indicate significant progress toward the continued development of a safe, sustainable, and profitable space economy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity Methods for Path Integral and Safe Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling-based approaches are widely used in systems without analytic models to estimate risk or find optimal control. However, gathering sufficient data in such scenarios can be prohibitively costly. On the other hand, in many situations, low-fidelity models or simulators are available from which samples can be obtained at low cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for risk quantification and path integral control that leverages such data from multiple models with heterogeneous sampling costs. A key technical novelty of our approach is the integration of Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) and Multi-fidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) that enable data from different time and state representations (system models) to be jointly used to reduce variance and improve sampling efficiency. We also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method and show that our estimator is unbiased and consistent under mild conditions. Finally, we demonstrate via numerical simulation that the proposed method has improved computation (sampling costs) vs. accuracy trade-offs for risk quantification and path integral control.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of nonlinear forced response curves via reduction on spectral submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forced response curves (FRCs) of nonlinear systems can exhibit complex behaviors, including hardening/softening behavior and bifurcations. Although topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model (ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving targeted performance optimization. This framework provides a practical and efficient strategy for incorporating nonlinear dynamic effects into the topology optimization of structures.</description>

      <title>Multi-level informed optimization via decomposed Kriging for large design problems under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering design involves demanding models encompassing many decision variables and uncontrollable parameters. In addition, unavoidable aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties can be very impactful and add further complexity. The state-of-the-art adopts two steps, uncertainty quantification and design optimization, to optimize systems under uncertainty by means of robust or stochastic metrics. However, conventional scenario-based, surrogate-assisted, and mathematical programming methods are not sufficiently scalable to be affordable and precise in large and complex cases. Here, a multi-level approach is proposed to accurately optimize resource-intensive, high-dimensional, and complex engineering problems under uncertainty with minimal resources. A non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate is developed to map the combined design/parameter domain efficiently. Multiple surrogates are adaptively updated by hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to leverage the fewer and most uncertainty-informed data. The proposed method is statistically compared to the state-of-the-art via an analytical testbed and is shown to be concurrently faster and more accurate by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Stable, Accurate and Well-Conditioned Time-Domain PMCHWT Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new boundary element formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by homogeneous dielectric objects based on the time-domain PMCHWT equation. To address dense-mesh breakdown, a multiplicative Calderon preconditioner utilizing a modified static electric field integral operator is employed. Large-timestep breakdown and late-time instability are simultaneously resolved by rescaling the Helmholtz components leveraging the quasi-Helmholtz projectors and using temporal differentiation and integration as rescaling operators. This rescaling also balances the loop and star components at large timesteps, improving solution accuracy. The resulting discrete system is solved using a marching-on-in-time scheme and iterative solvers. Numerical experiments for simply- and multiply-connected dielectric scatterers, including highly non-smooth geometries, corroborate the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic and scalable method for arbitrary rigid-bodies equipped with vectorized thrusters. Two novel solutions are proposed: a closed-form, Lipschitz continuous mapping that ensures smooth actuator orientation references, and a convex optimization formulation capable of handling practical actuator constraints such as thrust saturation and angular rate limits. Both methods leverage the null-space structure of the allocation mapping to perform singularity avoidance while generating sub-optimal yet practical solutions. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework are demonstrated through numerical simulations on a 3DOF marine vessel and a 6DOF aerial quadcopter.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop control of sloshing fuel in a spinning spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New-generation space missions require satellites to carry substantial amounts of liquid propellant, making it essential to analyse the coupled control-structure-propellant dynamics in detail. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers high-fidelity predictions, its computational cost limits its use in iterative design. Equivalent Mechanical Models (EMMs) provide a faster alternative, though their predictive performance, especially in closed-loop scenarios, remains largely unexplored. This work presents a comparative analysis of a spacecraft under feedback control, using both CFD and a reduced-order sloshing model. Results show good agreement, validating the simplified model for the manoeuvrer considered. This validation enables efficient sensitivity and stability studies, offering a practical tool for early-stage spacecraft design.</description>

      <title>SecuLEx: a Secure Limit Exchange Market for Dynamic Operating Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) are transforming power networks, challenging traditional operational methods, and requiring new coordination mechanisms. To address this challenge, this paper introduces SecuLEx (Secure Limit Exchange), a new market-based paradigm to allocate power injection and withdrawal limits that guarantee network security during time periods, called dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). Under this paradigm, distribution system operators (DSOs) assign initial DOEs to customers. These limits can be exchanged afterward through a market, allowing customers to reallocate them according to their needs while ensuring network operational constraints. We formalize SecuLEx and illustrate DOE allocation and market exchanges on a small-scale low-voltage (LV) network, demonstrating that both procedures are computationally tractable. In this example, SecuLEx reduces renewable curtailment and improves grid utilization and social welfare compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Satellite Navigation and Control using Physics-Informed Artificial Potential Field and Sliding Mode Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increase in the number of space exploration missions has led to the accumulation of space debris, posing risk of collision with the operational satellites. Addressing this challenge is crucial for the sustainability of space operations. To plan a safe trajectory in the presence of moving space debris, an integrated approach of artificial potential field and sliding mode controller is proposed and implemented in this paper. The relative 6-DOF kinematics and dynamics of the spacecraft is modelled in the framework of geometric mechanics with the relative configuration expressed through exponential coordinates. Various collision avoidance guidance algorithms have been proposed in the literature but the Artificial Potential Field guidance algorithm is computationally efficient and enables real-time path adjustments to avoid collision with obstacles. However, it is prone to issues such as local minima. In literature, local minima issue is typically avoided by either redefining the potential function such as adding vorticity or by employing search techniques which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, a physics-informed APF is proposed in this paper where Hamiltonian mechanics is used instead of the traditional Newtonian mechanics-based approach. In this approach, instead of relying on attractive and repulsive forces for path planning, the Hamiltonian approach uses the potential field to define a path of minimum potential. Additionally, to track the desired trajectory planned by the guidance algorithm within a fixed-time frame, a non-singular fixed-time sliding mode controller (FTSMC) is used. The proposed fixed-time sliding surface not only ensures fixed-time convergence of system states but also guarantees the global stability of the closed-loop system without singularity. The simulation results presented support the claims made.</description>

      <title>A Control Allocation Algorithm for Hypersonic Glide Vehicles with Input Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) operate in challenging flight regimes characterized by strong nonlinearities in actuation and stringent physical constraints. These include state-dependent actuator limitations, asymmetric control bounds, and thermal loads that vary with maneuvering conditions. This paper introduces an iterative control allocation method to address these challenges in real time. The proposed algorithm searches for control inputs that achieve the desired moment commands while respecting constraints on input magnitude and rate. For slender HGV configurations, thermal loads and drag generation are strongly correlated-lower drag typically results in reduced surface heating. By embedding drag-sensitive soft constraints, the method improves energy efficiency and implicitly reduces surface temperatures, lowering the vehicle's infrared signature. These features are particularly advantageous for long-range military operations that require low observability. The approach is demonstrated using the DLR's Generic Hypersonic Glide Vehicle 2 (GHGV-2) simulation model. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in maintaining control authority under realistic, constrained flight conditions.</description>

      <title>CPU- and GPU-Based Parallelization of the Robust Reference Governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint management is a central challenge in modern control systems. A solution is the Reference Governor (RG), which is an add-on strategy to pre-stabilized feedback control systems to enforce state and input constraints by shaping the reference command. While robust formulations of RG exist for linear systems, their extension to nonlinear systems is often computationally intractable. This paper develops a scenario-based robust RG formulation for nonlinear systems and investigates its parallel implementation on multi-core CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPUs. We analyze the computational structure of the algorithm, identify parallelization opportunities, and implement the resulting schemes on modern parallel hardware. Benchmarking on a nonlinear hydrogen fuel cell model demonstrates order-of-magnitude speedups (by as much as three orders of magnitude) compared to sequential implementations.</description>

      <title>Underground Power Distribution System Restoration Using Inverter Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground power distribution systems (PDSs) are increasingly deployed in urban areas. The integration of smart devices including smart switchgears, pad-mounted distribution transformers and inverter-based resources (IBRs) enhance system resilience, however simultaneously introducing unique challenges. The challenges include inrush currents caused by trapped charges in underground cables, ferroresonance in distribution transformers during energization, and three-phase load imbalance resulting from single-phase underground laterals. To address these issues, this paper proposes an underground PDS restoration framework using IBRs. Firstly, an underground cable energization model is developed to quantify inrush current by analyzing voltage differences across both switchgear terminals. Secondly, a distribution transformer energization model is proposed to evaluate ferroresonance using Q-factor constraints based on underground cable capacitance and damping resistance. Thirdly, a phase-swapping model is proposed to improve load balancing by dynamically reassigning lateral-phase connections through smart switchgears. The proposed models are further integrated into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to maximize the total weighted restored load while constraining inrush currents, ferroresonance, and phase imbalance. To address the nonlinearity induced by impedance matrix reordering during phase swapping, a permutation-based linearization technique is proposed. Finally, case studies on an underground PDS established based on IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving uderground PDS restoration performance.</description>

      <title>Learning to Mitigate Post-Outage Load Surges: A Data-Driven Framework for Electrifying and Decarbonizing Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrification and decarbonization are transforming power system demand and recovery dynamics, yet their implications for post-outage load surges remain poorly understood. Here we analyze a metropolitan-scale heterogeneous dataset for Indianapolis comprising 30,046 feeder-level outages between 2020 and 2024, linked to smart meters and submetering, to quantify the causal impact of electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) on restoration surges. Statistical analysis and causal forest inference demonstrate that rising penetrations of all three assets significantly increase surge ratios, with effects strongly modulated by restoration timing, outage duration and weather conditions. We develop a component-aware multi-task Transformer estimator that disaggregates EV, HP and DER contributions, and apply it to project historical outages under counterfactual 2035 adoption pathways. In a policy-aligned pathway, evening restorations emerge as the binding reliability constraint, with exceedance probabilities of 0.057 when 30\% of system load is restored within the first 15 minutes. Mitigation measures, probabilistic EV restarts, short thermostat offsets and accelerated DER reconnection, reduce exceedance to 0.019 and eliminate it entirely when 20\% or less of system load is restored. These results demonstrate that transition-era surges are asset-driven and causally linked to electrification and decarbonization, but can be effectively managed through integrated operational strategies.</description>

      <title>A time-causal and time-recursive analogue of the Gabor transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14512v9 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a time-causal analogue of the Gabor filter, as well as a both time-causal and time-recursive analogue of the Gabor transform, where the proposed time-causal representations obey both temporal scale covariance and a cascade property with a simplifying kernel over temporal scales. The motivation behind these constructions is to enable theoretically well-founded time-frequency analysis over multiple temporal scales for real-time situations, or for physical or biological modelling situations, when the future cannot be accessed, and the non-causal access to future in Gabor filtering is therefore not viable for a time-frequency analysis of the system.
  We develop the theory for these representations, obtained by replacing the Gaussian kernel in Gabor filtering with a time-causal kernel, referred to as the time-causal limit kernel, which guarantees simplification properties from finer to coarser levels of scales in a time-causal situation, similar as the Gaussian kernel can be shown to guarantee over a non-causal temporal domain. In these ways, the proposed time-frequency representations guarantee well-founded treatment over multiple scales, in situations when the characteristic scales in the signals, or physical or biological phenomena, to be analyzed may vary substantially, and additionally all steps in the time-frequency analysis have to be fully time-causal.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

      <title>A Digital Pheromone-Based Approach for In/Out-of-Control Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control (OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences, representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics, imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and predictive maintenance in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Accuracy, Memory Efficiency and Generalization: A Comparative Study on Liquid Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks (LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network, demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks. This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs, summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in broader and more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>GATO: GPU-Accelerated and Batched Trajectory Optimization for Scalable Edge Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm, software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality, without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections. We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude less computation time than projection based methods.</description>

      <title>Optimizing BCI Rehabilitation Protocols for Stroke: Exploring Task Design and Training Duration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and the second most common cause of death worldwide. Although acute treatments have advanced, recovery remains challenging and limited. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a promising tool for post-stroke rehabilitation by promoting neuroplasticity. However, clinical outcomes remain variable, and optimal protocols have yet to be established. This study explores strategies to optimize BCI-based rehabilitation by comparing motor imagery of affected hand movement versus rest, instead of the conventional left-versus-right motor imagery. This alternative aims to simplify the task and address the weak contralateral activation commonly observed in stroke patients. Two datasets, one from healthy individuals and one from stroke patients, were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The results showed improved performance using both FBCSP and EEGNet. Additionally, we investigated the impact of session duration and found that shorter training sessions produced better BCI performance than longer sessions.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory optimisation using finite-horizon, decoherence time and discounted mean-square performance criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum memory systems for approximately retaining quantum information, such as initial dynamic variables or quantum states to be stored over a bounded time interval. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics, the deviation of the system variables from their initial values lends itself to closed-form computation in terms of tractable moment dynamics for open quantum harmonic oscillators and finite-level quantum systems governed by linear or quasi-linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations, respectively. This tractability is used in a recently proposed optimality criterion for varying the system parameters so as to maximise the memory decoherence time when the mean-square deviation achieves a given critical threshold. The memory decoherence time maximisation approach is extended beyond the previously considered low-threshold asymptotic approximation and to Schr\"{o}dinger type mean-square deviation functionals for the reduced system state governed by the Lindblad master equation. We link this approach with the minimisation of the mean-square deviation functionals at a finite time horizon and with their discounted version which quantifies the averaged performance of the quantum system as a temporary memory under a Poisson flow of storage requests.</description>

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a classical bilevel implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16250v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end engineering design pipelines, in which designs are evaluated using concurrently defined optimal controllers, are becoming increasingly common in practice. To discover designs that perform well even under the misspecification of system dynamics, such end-to-end pipelines have now begun evaluating designs with a robust control objective in place of the nominal optimal control setup. Current approaches of specifying such robust control subproblems, however, rely on hand specification of perturbations anticipated to be present upon deployment or margin methods that ignore problem structure, resulting in a lack of theoretical guarantees and overly conservative empirical performance. We, instead, propose a novel methodology for LQR systems that leverages conformal prediction to specify such uncertainty regions in a data-driven fashion. Such regions have distribution-free coverage guarantees on the true system dynamics, in turn allowing for a probabilistic characterization of the regret of the resulting robust controller. We then demonstrate that such a controller can be efficiently produced via a novel policy gradient method that has convergence guarantees. We finally demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our method over alternate robust control specifications, such as $H_{\infty}$ and LQR with multiplicative noise, across a collection of engineering control systems.</description>

      <title>A Long-Duration Autonomy Approach to Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>

Abstract: In this article, we present a long-duration autonomy approach for the control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating in a transportation network. In particular, we focus on the performance of CAVs at traffic bottlenecks, including roundabouts, merging roadways, and intersections. We take a principled approach based on optimal control, and derive a reactive controller with guarantees on safety, performance, and energy efficiency. We guarantee safety through high order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), which we ``lift'' to first order CBFs using time-optimal motion primitives. This yields a set of first-order CBFs that are compatible with the control bounds. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in simulation and compare it to an optimal control-based approach.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Functional Derivatives in Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probability generating functionals (PGFLs) are efficient and powerful tools for tracking independent objects in clutter. It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity. Key properties of the functional derivative are revealed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Low-Level MPC for Multi-Agent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with model-based control.</description>

      <title>Resilient Multi-Dimensional Consensus and Distributed Optimization against Agent-Based and Denial-of-Service Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resilient multi-dimensional consensus and distributed optimization problems of multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of both agent-based and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered agent-based attacks can cover malicious, Byzantine, and stubborn agents. The links between agents in the network can be blocked by DoS attacks, which may lead the digraph to be time-varying and even disconnected. The objective is to ensure that the remaining benign agents achieve consensus. To this end, an "auxiliary point"-based resilient control algorithm is proposed for MASs. Under the proposed algorithm, each healthy agent constructs a "safe kernel" utilizing the states of its in-neighbors and updates its state toward a specific point within this kernel at each iteration. If an agent cannot receive its neighbors' states owing to DoS attacks, it will use the states received immediately before the DoS period. Moreover, a resilient multi-dimensional distributed optimization (RMDO) algorithm is also proposed. Theoretical proofs and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Identification and optimal control strategies for the transversal splitting of ultra--cold Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</description>

Abstract: An iterative learning algorithm is presented for continuous-time linear-quadratic optimal control problems where the system is externally symmetric with unknown dynamics. Both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon problems are considered. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is globally convergent to the optimal solution and has some advantages over adaptive dynamic programming, including being unbiased under noisy measurements and having a relatively low computational burden. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the results.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Structural Health Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a critical task for ensuring the safety and reliability of civil infrastructures, typically realized on bridges and viaducts by means of vibration monitoring. In this paper, we propose for the first time the use of Transformer neural networks, with a Masked Auto-Encoder architecture, as Foundation Models for SHM. We demonstrate the ability of these models to learn generalizable representations from multiple large datasets through self-supervised pre-training, which, coupled with task-specific fine-tuning, allows them to outperform state-of-the-art traditional methods on diverse tasks, including Anomaly Detection (AD) and Traffic Load Estimation (TLE). We then extensively explore model size versus accuracy trade-offs and experiment with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve the performance of smaller Transformers, enabling their embedding directly into the SHM edge nodes.
  We showcase the effectiveness of our foundation models using data from three operational viaducts. For AD, we achieve a near-perfect 99.9% accuracy with a monitoring time span of just 15 windows. In contrast, a state-of-the-art method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) obtains its first good result (95.03% accuracy), only considering 120 windows. On two different TLE tasks, our models obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation metrics (R$^2$ score, MAE% and MSE%). On the first benchmark, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.97 and 0.90 for light and heavy vehicle traffic, respectively, while the best previous approach (a Random Forest) stops at 0.91 and 0.84. On the second one, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.54 versus the 0.51 of the best competitor method, a Long-Short Term Memory network.</description>

      <title>Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves: Representation, measurements and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. The past 5 years have seen an explosion in the availability of large-scale traffic data containing traffic waves and complex congestion patterns, making existing approaches unsuitable for repeatable and scalable analysis of traffic waves in these data. This paper makes a first step towards addressing this challenge by introducing an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. It enables the measurement of wave properties at scale. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. Our results show insights on the complexity of traffic waves. Traffic waves can bifurcate and merge at a scale that has never been observed or described before. The clustering analysis of all the identified wave components reveals the different topological structures of traffic waves. We explored that the wave merge or bifurcation points can be explained by spatial features. The gallery of all the identified wave topologies is demonstrated at https://trafficwaves.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Optimizing Real-Time Optimal Control for Embedded SoCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resource-limited robots face significant challenges in executing computationally intensive tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, particularly for real-time optimal control algorithms like Model Predictive Control (MPC). This paper provides a comprehensive design space exploration to identify optimal hardware computation architectures for these demanding model-based control algorithms. We profile and optimize representative architectural designs, including general-purpose scalar CPUs, vector processors, and specialized accelerators. By characterizing kernel-level benchmarks and end-to-end robotic scenarios, including a hardware-in-the-loop evaluation on a fabricated RISC-V multi-core vector SoC, we present a quantitative comparison of performance, area, and utilization across distinct architectural design points. Our findings demonstrate that targeted architectural modifications, coupled with deep software and system optimizations, enable up to 3.71x speedups for MPC, resulting in up to 27% system-level power reductions while completing robotic tasks. Finally, we propose a code generation flow designed to simplify the complex engineering effort required for mapping robotic workloads onto specialized architectures.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Carleman-Fourier linearization for analyzing nonlinear real dynamical systems with periodic vector fields. Using Fourier basis functions, this novel framework transforms such dynamical systems into equivalent infinite-dimensional linear dynamical systems. In this paper, we establish the exponential convergence of the primary block in the finite-section approximation of this linearized system to the state vector of the original nonlinear system. To showcase the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the Kuramoto model, a prominent model for coupled oscillators. The results demonstrate promising accuracy in approximating the original system's behavior.</description>

      <title>Learn to Bid as a Price-Maker Wind Power Producer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wind power producers (WPPs) participating in short-term power markets face significant imbalance costs due to their non-dispatchable and variable production. While some WPPs have a large enough market share to influence prices with their bidding decisions, existing optimal bidding methods rarely account for this aspect. Price-maker approaches typically model bidding as a bilevel optimization problem, but these methods require complex market models, estimating other participants' actions, and are computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we propose an online learning algorithm that leverages contextual information to optimize WPP bids in the price-maker setting. We formulate the strategic bidding problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit, ensuring provable regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against various benchmark strategies using a numerical simulation of the German day-ahead and real-time markets.</description>

      <title>Autonomy Architectures for Safe Planning in Unknown Environments Under Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mission planning can often be formulated as a constrained control problem under multiple path constraints (i.e., safety constraints) and budget constraints (i.e., resource expenditure constraints). In a priori unknown environments, verifying that an offline solution will satisfy the constraints for all time can be difficult, if not impossible. We present ReRoot, a novel sampling-based framework that enforces safety and budget constraints for nonlinear systems in unknown environments. The main idea is that ReRoot grows multiple reverse RRT* trees online, starting from renewal sets, i.e., sets where the budget constraints are renewed. The dynamically feasible backup trajectories guarantee safety and reduce resource expenditure, which provides a principled backup policy when integrated into the gatekeeper safety verification architecture. We demonstrate our approach in simulation with a fixed-wing UAV in a GNSS-denied environment with a budget constraint on localization error that can be renewed at visual landmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16369v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Foundation Models for IoT: Taxonomy and Criteria-Based Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security &amp; privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.</description>

      <title>MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</description>

      <title>OmniRetarget: Interaction-Preserving Data Generation for Humanoid Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Scene Interaction</title>

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.</description>

      <title>Product-oriented Product-Process-Resource Asset Network and its Representation in AutomationML for Asset Administration Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00933</link>

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and (ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating the impacts of the end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This paper proposes a modeling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource (PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) incorporates repairing, remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization via a Control-Centric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical technologies, where the speed and reliability of convergence directly impact performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard: controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control. In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and gradient dynamics. Each realization shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics, and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.</description>
