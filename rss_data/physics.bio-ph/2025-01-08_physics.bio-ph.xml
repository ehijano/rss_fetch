      <title>Neural networks consisting of DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks based on soft and biological matter constitute an interesting potential alternative to traditional implementations based on electric circuits. DNA is a particularly promising system in this context due its natural ability to store information. In recent years, researchers have started to construct neural networks that are based on DNA. In this chapter, I provide a very basic introduction to the concept of DNA neural networks, aiming at an audience that is not familiar with biochemistry.</description>

      <title>Energy injection in an epithelial cell monolayer via negative viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids are driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by internally generated forces, causing complex patterns of motion. Even when both the forces and motion are measurable, it is not yet possible to relate the two, because the sources of energy injection and dissipation are often unclear. Here, we study how energy is transferred by developing a method to measure viscosity from the shear stresses and strain rates within an epithelial cell monolayer. Surprisingly, there emerged multicellular regions in which the relationship between shear stress and shear strain rate was negatively proportional, indicating a negative viscosity. We provide direct experimental evidence that the negative viscosity results from cells aligning their stresses with the orientation of the flow. Regions of negative viscosity consistently exhibited greater cell speed and vorticity, and the cells had elevated metabolic activity, indicating that negative viscosity is a mechanism for injection of surplus energy. More broadly, our study shows that negative viscosity is a useful means of quantifying the flow of energy in active materials.</description>

      <title>Illuminating extracellular vesicles biology with super resolution microscopy: Insights into morphology and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03713v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Resolution Microscopy (SRM) is emerging as a powerful and innovative tool for imaging, characterizing, and understanding the structure of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). By addressing the need for single-particle analysis with the high resolution required to study the composition and organization of these nanoparticles, SRM provides unique insights into EV biology. However, its application is accompanied by significant challenges, ranging from experimental setup to data analysis. This review outlines the fundamentals of SRM and its position within the broader field of EV research. We then explore its applications in evaluating (i) the morphological structure of EVs, (ii) their molecular composition, and (iii) their roles in biological systems. By offering practical guidance and an overview of critical parameters for standardization, this review aims at providing researchers with the tools and insights necessary to effectively apply SRM to EV investigation.</description>

      <title>Red blood cells aggregates transport for finite concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are responsible for transporting oxygen and various metabolites to tissues and organs, as well as removing waste. Several cardiovascular diseases can impair these functions. For instance, in diabetes, increased RBC aggregation can lead to blood occlusion, thereby depriving tissues of efficient oxygen delivery. Interestingly, RBC adhesion occurs not only in disease states but also under physiological conditions, with the key difference being that adhesion is reversible in healthy situations. This paper focuses on numerical simulations in 2D, exploring different adhesion energies (both physiological and pathological) alongside varying flow strengths and hematocrit levels. A systematic analysis of RBC flux and viscosity is conducted. A remarkable finding is that moderate adhesion energy (within the physiological range) enhances RBC transport, thereby improving oxygen delivery to tissues. This provides insight into why RBC adhesion is present under normal conditions. Conversely, increasing adhesion energy beyond a certain point causes a collapse in RBC flux, thus reducing oxygen transport. We provide a basic explanation for the non-monotonic effect of adhesion energy on blood flow efficiency. This finding serves as an initial step in understanding the impact (both positive and negative) of RBC adhesion before addressing this issue in complex networks inspired by realistic microvasculatures.</description>

      <title>Analog of the Carnot engine for fluctuating diffusivity in living cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a formal analogy between the fluctuating diffusivity and thermodynamics has been proposed based on phenomena of heterogeneous diffusion observed in living cells. This not only offers the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also achieves that of the Clausius inequality for the entropy concerning diffusivity fluctuations. Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Activity-Driven Dynamics of Semiflexible Polymers in Motility Assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of semiflexible polymers in a motility assay, where motor proteins (MPs) stochastically bind, unbind, and walk along the polymer, under the influence of harmonic confinement. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we explore the interplay between the polymer's rigidity, activity in the form of attachment/detachment of MPs and subsequent movement of attached MPs, and trap strength, revealing a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region. Rigidity significantly impacts the trapping behaviour, with flexible polymers remaining trapped at the higher activity. Attachment/detachment of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap.The polymer undergoes spiral and open-chain conformations, with the turning number serving as a key order parameter to quantify spiral formation. We show that confinement stabilizes spiral structures and suppresses open-chain motion, especially at higher activity. The centre of mass (COM) dynamics are analyzed through the mean square displacement (MSD), showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Negative excess kurtosis indicates nonequilibrium behaviour, which saturates with increasing confinement, reflecting the dominance of the trap over the activity.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble chemotaxis using reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial cells use run-and-tumble motion to climb up attractant concentration gradient in their environment. By extending the uphill runs and shortening the downhill runs the cells migrate towards the higher attractant zones. Motivated by this, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm where an agent moves in one dimension in the presence of an attractant gradient. The agent can perform two actions: either persistent motion in the same direction or reversal of direction. We assign costs for these actions based on the recent history of the agent's trajectory. We ask the question: which RL strategy works best in different types of attractant environment. We quantify efficiency of the RL strategy by the ability of the agent (a) to localize in the favorable zones after large times, and (b) to learn about its complete environment. Depending on the attractant profile and the initial condition, we find an optimum balance is needed between exploration and exploitation to ensure the most efficient performance.</description>

      <title>Damage and recovery of flagella in soil bacteria exposed to shear within long microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The swimming motility of bacteria is driven by the action of bacterial flagellar motors, whose outermost structure is a long and thin helicoidal filament. When rotated, the fluid medium exerts an anisotropic viscous drag on the flagellar filaments, ultimately leading to bacterial propulsion. The flagellar filaments are protein-based flexible structures that can break due to interactions with fluid flows. Here, we study the evolution of flagellar filaments in the soil bacterium $\textit{Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens}$ after being exposed to shear flows created in long microchannels, for shear rates between $1$ s$^{-1}$ and $10^5$ s$^{-1}$, and for durations between tens of milliseconds and minutes. We demonstrate that the average swimming speed and fraction of swimming cells decrease after exposition to shear, but both parameters can recover, at least partially, with time. These observations support the hypothesis that shear flows cut flagellar filaments but that reversibly damaged bacterial flagellar motors can be restored thanks to filament regeneration. By fitting our observations with phenomenological expressions, we obtain the individual growth rates of the two different flagellar filaments that $\textit{B. diazoefficiens}$ possesses, showing that the lateral filaments have a recovery time of about 40 min while the subpolar one requires more than 4.5 h to regrow. Our work demonstrates that simple monitoring of bacterial motility after exposition to shear can be used to characterize the process of flagellar filament breakup and growth, a phenomenon widely present in bacteria swimming in porous soil and exposed to shear flows due to rainfall and watering systems.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of bacterial growth by antibiotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growth in bacterial populations generally depends on the environment (availability and quality of nutrients, presence of a toxic inhibitor, product inhibition..). Here, we build a general model to describe the action of a bacteriostatic antibiotic, assuming that this drug inhibits essential autocatalytic cycles involved in the cell metabolism. The model can describe various types of antibiotics and confirms the existence of two distinct regimes of growth-dependent susceptibility, previously identified only for ribosome targeting antibiotics. Interestingly, below a certain threshold, a coexistence of two values of the growth rate is possible, which has also been observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>Wave-driven phase wave patterns in a ring of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.</description>
