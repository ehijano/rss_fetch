      <title>The nature of mathematical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling has become a widespread, useful tool in mathematics applied to diverse fields, from physics to economics to biomedicine. Practitioners of modeling may use algebraic or differential equations, to the elements of which they attribute an intuitive relationship with some relevant aspect of reality they wish to represent. More sophisticated expressions may include stochasticity, either as observation error or system noise. However, a clear, unambiguous mathematical definition of what a model is and of what is the relationship between the model and the real-life phenomena it purports to represent has so far not been formulated. The present work aims to fill this gap, motivating the definition of a mathematical model as an operator on a Hilbert space of random variables, identifying the experimental realization as the map between the theoretical space of model construction and the computational space of statistical model identification, and tracing the relationship of the geometry of the model manifold in the abstract setting with the corresponding geometry of the prediction surfaces in statistical estimation.</description>

      <title>Nested Instrumental Variables Design: Switcher Average Treatment Effect, Identification, Efficient Estimation and Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) are a commonly used tool to estimate causal effects from non-randomized data. An archetype of an IV is a randomized trial with non-compliance where the randomized treatment assignment serves as an IV for the non-ignorable treatment received. Under a monotonicity assumption, a valid IV non-parametrically identifies the average treatment effect among a non-identified, latent complier subgroup, whose generalizability is often under debate. In many studies, there could exist multiple versions of an IV, for instance, different nudges to take the same treatment in different study sites in a multicentre clinical trial. These different versions of an IV may result in different compliance rates and offer a unique opportunity to study IV estimates' generalizability. In this article, we introduce a novel nested IV assumption and study identification of the average treatment effect among two latent subgroups: always-compliers and switchers, who are defined based on the joint potential treatment received under two versions of a binary IV. We derive the efficient influence function for the SWitcher Average Treatment Effect (SWATE) under a non-parametric model and propose efficient estimators. We then propose formal statistical tests of the generalizability of IV estimates under the nested IV framework. We apply the proposed method to the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and study the causal effect of colorectal cancer screening and its generalizability.</description>
