      <title>Beliefs about Bots: How Employers Plan for AI in White-Collar Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide experimental evidence on how employers adjust expectations to automation risk in high-skill, white-collar work. Using a randomized information intervention among tax advisors in Germany, we show that firms systematically underestimate automatability. Information provision raises risk perceptions, especially for routine-intensive roles. Yet, it leaves short-run hiring plans unchanged. Instead, updated beliefs increase productivity and financial expectations with minor wage adjustments, implying within-firm inequality like limited rent-sharing. Employers also anticipate new tasks in legal tech, compliance, and AI interaction, and report higher training and adoption intentions.</description>

      <title>There's Nothing in the Air</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do wages grow faster in bigger cities? We use French administrative data to decompose the urban wage growth premium and find that the answer has surprisingly little to do with cities themselves. While we document substantially faster wage growth in larger cities, 80% of the premium disappears after controlling for the composition of firms and coworkers. We also document significantly higher job-to-job transition rates in larger cities, suggesting workers climb the job ladder faster. Most strikingly, when we focus on workers who remain in the same job -- eliminating the job ladder mechanism -- the urban wage growth premium falls by 94.1% after accounting for firms and coworkers. The residual effect is statistically indistinguishable from zero. These results challenge the view that cities generate human capital spillovers ``in the air,'' suggesting instead that urban wage dynamics reflect the sorting of firms and workers and the pace of job mobility.</description>

      <title>Wildfire and house prices: A synthetic control case study of Altadena (Jan 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to estimate the causal impact of a January 2025 wildfire on housing prices in Altadena, California. We construct a 'synthetic' Altadena from a weighted average of peer cities to serve as a counterfactual; this approach assumes no spillover effects on the donor pool. The results reveal a substantial negative price effect that intensifies over time. Over the six months following the event, we estimate an average monthly loss of $32,125. The statistical evidence for this effect is nuanced. Based on the robust post-to-pre-treatment RMSPE ratio, the result is statistically significant at the 10% level (p = 0.0508). In contrast, the effect is not statistically significant when measured by the average post-treatment gap (p = 0.3220). This analysis highlights the significant financial risks faced by communities in fire-prone regions and demonstrates SCM's effectiveness in evaluating disaster-related economic damages.</description>

      <title>Exploring Vulnerability in AI Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid ascent of Foundation Models (FMs), enabled by the Transformer architecture, drives the current AI ecosystem. Characterized by large-scale training and downstream adaptability, FMs (as GPT family) have achieved massive public adoption, fueling a turbulent market shaped by platform economics and intense investment. Assessing the vulnerability of this fast-evolving industry is critical yet challenging due to data limitations. This paper proposes a synthetic AI Vulnerability Index (AIVI) focusing on the upstream value chain for FM production, prioritizing publicly available data. We model FM output as a function of five inputs: Compute, Data, Talent, Capital, and Energy, hypothesizing that supply vulnerability in any input threatens the industry. Key vulnerabilities include compute concentration, data scarcity and legal risks, talent bottlenecks, capital intensity and strategic dependencies, as well as escalating energy demands. Acknowledging imperfect input substitutability, we propose a weighted geometrical average of aggregate subindexes, normalized using theoretical or empirical benchmarks. Despite limitations and room for improvement, this preliminary index aims to quantify systemic risks in AI's core production engine, and implicitly shed a light on the risks for downstream value chain.</description>

      <title>A quality of mercy is not trained: the imagined vs. the practiced in healthcare process-specialized AI development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high stakes organizational contexts like healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being designed to augment complex coordination tasks. This paper investigates how the ethical stakes of such systems are shaped by their epistemic framings: what aspects of work they represent, and what they exclude. Drawing on an embedded study of AI development for operating room (OR) scheduling at a Canadian hospital, we compare scheduling-as-imagined in the AI design process: rule-bound, predictable, and surgeon-centric, with scheduling-as-practiced as a fluid, patient-facing coordination process involving ethical discretion. We show how early representational decisions narrowed what the AI could support, resulting in epistemic foreclosure: the premature exclusion of key ethical dimensions from system design. Our findings surface the moral consequences of abstraction and call for a more situated approach to designing healthcare process-specialized artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>MacroEnergy.jl: A large-scale multi-sector energy system framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MacroEnergy.jl (aka Macro) is an open-source framework for multi-sector capacity expansion modeling and analysis of macro-energy systems. It is written in Julia and uses the JuMP package to interface with a wide range of mathematical solvers. It enables researchers and practitioners to design and analyze energy and industrial systems that span electricity, fuels, bioenergy, steel, chemicals, and other sectors. The framework is organized around a small set of sector-agnostic components that can be combined into flexible graph structures, making it straightforward to extend to new technologies, policies, and commodities. Its companion packages support decomposition methods and other advanced techniques, allowing users to scale models across fine temporal and spatial resolutions. MacroEnergy.jl provides a versatile platform for studying energy transitions at the detail and scale demanded by modern research and policy.</description>

      <title>Multiplexing in Networks and Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social and economic networks are often multiplexed, meaning that people are connected by different types of relationships -- such as borrowing goods and giving advice. We make two contributions to the study of multiplexing and the understanding of simple versus complex contagion. On the theoretical side, we introduce a model and theoretical results about diffusion in multiplex networks. We show that multiplexing impedes the spread of simple contagions, such as diseases or basic information that only require one interaction to transmit an infection. We show, however that multiplexing enhances the spread of a complex contagion when infection rates are low, but then impedes complex contagion if infection rates become high. On the empirical side, we document empirical multiplexing patterns in Indian village data. We show that relationships such as socializing, advising, helping, and lending are correlated but distinct, while commonly used proxies for networks based on ethnicity and geography are nearly uncorrelated with actual relationships. We also show that these layers and their overlap affect information diffusion in a field experiment. The advice network is the best predictor of diffusion, but combining layers improves predictions further. Villages with greater overlap between layers -- more multiplexing -- experience less overall diffusion. Finally, we identify differences in multiplexing by gender and connectedness. These have implications for inequality in diffusion-mediated outcomes such as access to information and adherence to norms.</description>

      <title>The Underlying Stimulators of Chinese Government Spending on Pension and Welfare: A Co-Integrated Socio-Economic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs a co-integrated socio-economic model to investigate the long-run drivers of Chinese government expenditure on public pensions, addressing critical stability and sustainability challenges. Our methodology establishes a genuine long-run relationship and confirmed uni-directional causality from key socioeconomic variables to government spending. The central finding is the confirmation that China still possesses an exploitable demographic dividend (DD), which counters widespread assumptions of an immediate demographic crisis and provides a limited window for proactive policy action. However, the analysis also conclusively demonstrates that relying solely on strong GDP growth is insufficient for fund stabilization. Sustainability is fundamentally governed by the ratio of contributors to pensionaries. Consequently, the study concludes that comprehensive, structural labour market reforms are mandatory to maximize the current DD and strategically mitigate the financial imbalance caused by the eventual absence of this demographic advantage.</description>

      <title>Do Temporary Workers Face Higher Wage Markdowns? Evidence from India's Automotive Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contract workers constitute half of India's automotive employment but earn substantially less than permanent workers. Using ASI data (2002-2019), I develop an estimator of labor supply and demand schedules to explain this wage premium. The model features worker-type-specific discrete choice labor supply, nested CES production, Nash-Bertrand competition for contract workers, and plant-union bargaining for permanent workers. I find the premium stems entirely from higher productivity rather than differential monopsony power. While a lump-sum transfer offsetting wage markdowns would increase welfare by 14% for permanent and 12% for contract workers, it would simultaneously increase the premium by 14%, exacerbating inequality.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Flipped Classrooms in Higher Education: A Causal Machine Learning Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses double/debiased machine learning (DML) to evaluate the impact of transitioning from lecture-based blended teaching to a flipped classroom concept. Our findings indicate effects on students' self-conception, procrastination, and enjoyment. We do not find significant positive effects on exam scores, passing rates, or knowledge retention. This can be explained by the insufficient use of the instructional approach that we can identify with uniquely detailed usage data and highlights the need for additional teaching strategies. Methodologically, we propose a powerful DML approach that acknowledges the latent structure inherent in Likert scale variables and, hence, aligns with psychometric principles.</description>

      <title>Do More Suspicious Transaction Reports Lead to More Convictions for Money Laundering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Almost all countries in the world require banks to report suspicious transactions to national authorities. The reports are known as suspicious transaction or activity reports (we use the former term) and are intended to help authorities detect and prosecute money laundering. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between suspicious transaction reports and convictions for money laundering in the European Union. We use publicly available data from Europol, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics. To analyze the data, we employ a log-transformation and fit pooled (i.e., ordinary least squares) and fixed effects regression models. The fixed effects models, in particular, allow us to control for unobserved country-specific confounders (e.g., different laws regarding when and how reports should be filed). Initial results indicate that the number of suspicious transaction reports and convictions for money laundering in a country follow a sub-linear power law. Thus, while more reports may lead to more convictions, their marginal effect decreases with their amount. The relationship is robust to control variables such as the size of shadow economies and police forces. However, when we include time as a control, the relationship disappears in the fixed effects models. This suggests that the relationship is spurious rather than causal, driven by cross-country differences and a common time trend. In turn, a country cannot, ceteris paribus and with statistical confidence, expect that an increase in suspicious transaction reports will drive an increase in convictions.
  Our results have important implications for international anti-money laundering efforts and policies. (...)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The record-breaking heat in recent years, along with other extreme weather conditions worldwide has not only warned us about the devastating effects of global warming but also revived our interest in studying sustainability risks on a broader scale. In this paper, we propose a generalised model of sustainability risks characterising the economic-environmental-social nexus (EVS) based on a classic Lotka-Volterra framework. Compared to the World3 model proposed by Meadows et al. (1972) in their landmark study "The Limits to Growth", our model has numerous advantages such as i) better analytical tractability, ii) more representative characterisation of economic development arising from innovation, and iii) can be adopted in many potential applications of modelling sustainability risks from its sub-dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Subsidy Targeting in the Health Insurance Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act reached an all-time high of approximately 25 million Americans in 2025, roughly doubling since enhanced premium tax credit subsidies were made available in 2021. The scheduled expiration of enhanced subsidies in 2026 is estimated to leave over seven million Americans without health insurance coverage. Ten states have created supplemental Marketplace subsidies, yet little attention has been paid to how to best structure these subsidies to maximize coverage. Using administrative enrollment data from Maryland's Marketplace, we estimate demand for Marketplace coverage. Then, using estimated parameters and varying budget constraints, we simulate how to optimally allocate supplemental state premium subsidies to mitigate coverage losses from enhanced premium subsidy expiration. We find that premium sensitivity is greatest among enrollees with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, where the marginal effect of an additional ten dollars in monthly subsidies on the probability of coverage is approximately 6.5 percentage points, and decreases to roughly 2.5 percentage points above 200 percent FPL. Simulation results indicate that each 10 million dollars in annual state subsidies could retain roughly 5,000 enrollees, though the cost-effectiveness of these subsidies falls considerably once all enrollees below 200 percent of the federal poverty level are fully subsidized. We conclude that states are well positioned to mitigate, but not stop, coverage losses from expanded premium tax credit subsidy expiration.</description>

      <title>The Economic Dividends of Peace: Evidence from Arab-Israeli Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides the first causal evidence on the long-run economic dividends of Arab-Israeli peace treaties. Using synthetic control and difference-in-differences estimators, we analyze 1978 Camp David Accords and 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. Both cases reveal large and lasting gains. By 2011, real GDP of Egypt exceeded its synthetic counterfactual by 64 percent, and per capita income by 82 percent. Jordanian trajectory shows similarly permanent improvements, with real GDP higher by 75 percent and per capita income by more than 20 percent. The mechanisms differ: in Egypt, gains stem from a sharp fiscal reallocation together with higher foreign direct investment and improved institutional credibility, while Jordan benefited primarily through enhanced trade and financial inflows. Robustness and placebo tests confirm the uniqueness of these effects. The results demonstrate that peace agreements yield large, durable, and heterogeneous growth dividends.</description>

      <title>Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from European football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penalty shootouts play an important role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments, especially since the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule in its club competitions. Inspired by this rule change, our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, or psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, stronger teams, defined first by Elo ratings, do not perform better than their weaker opponents. Consequently, penalty shootouts are equivalent to a perfect lottery in top European football.</description>

Abstract: Entity resolution (probabilistic record linkage, deduplication) is a key step in scientific analysis and data science pipelines involving multiple data sources. The objective of entity resolution is to link records without common unique identifiers that refer to the same entity (e.g., person, company). However, without identifiers, researchers need to specify which records to compare in order to calculate matching probability and reduce computational complexity. One solution is to deterministically block records based on some common variables, such as names, dates of birth or sex or use phonetic algorithms. However, this approach assumes that these variables are free of errors and completely observed, which is often not the case. To address this challenge, we have developed a Python package, BlockingPy, which uses blocking using modern approximate nearest neighbour search and graph algorithms to reduce the number of comparisons. The package supports both CPU and GPU execution. In this paper, we present the design of the package, its functionalities and two case studies related to official statistics. The presented software will be useful for researchers interested in linking data from various sources.</description>

      <title>What Is Your AI Agent Buying? Evaluation, Implications and Emerging Questions for Agentic E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02630</link>

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, AI agents can parse webpages or interact through APIs to evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy-and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this. We first explore aggregate choices, revealing that modal choices can differ across models, with AI agents sometimes concentrating on a few products, raising competition questions. We then analyze the drivers of choices through rationality checks and randomized experiments on product positions and listing attributes. Models show sizeable and heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal ``top'' rank. They penalize sponsored tags, reward endorsements, and sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally as expected, but vary sharply across models. Finally, we find that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions can deliver substantial market-share gains by targeting AI buyer preferences. Our findings reveal how AI agents behave in e-commerce, and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions.</description>

      <title>Compensation-based risk-sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the mathematical problem of allocating payouts (compensations) in an endowment contingency fund using a risk-sharing rule that satisfies full allocation. Besides the participants, an administrator manages the fund by collecting ex-ante contributions to establish the fund and distributing ex-post payouts to members. Two types of administrators are considered. An 'active' administrator both invests in the fund and receives the payout of the fund when no participant receives a payout. A 'passive' administrator performs only administrative tasks and neither invests in nor receives a payout from the fund. We analyze the actuarial fairness of both compensation-based risk-sharing schemes and provide general conditions under which fairness is achieved. The results extend earlier work by Denuit and Robert (2025) and Dhaene and Milevsky (2024), who focused on payouts based on Bernoulli distributions, by allowing for general non-negative loss distributions.</description>
