      <title>Diversification Preferences and Risk Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio diversification is a cornerstone of modern finance, while risk aversion is central to decision theory; both concepts are long-standing and foundational. We investigate their connections by studying how different forms of diversification correspond to notions of risk aversion. We focus on the classical distinctions between weak and strong risk aversion, and consider diversification preferences for pairs of risks that are identically distributed, comonotonic, antimonotonic, independent, or exchangeable, as well as their intersections. Under a weak continuity condition and without assuming completeness of preferences, diversification for antimonotonic and identically distributed pairs implies weak risk aversion, and diversification for exchangeable pairs is equivalent to strong risk aversion. The implication from diversification for independent pairs to weak risk aversion requires a stronger continuity. We further provide results and examples that clarify the relationships between various diversification preferences and risk attitudes, in particular justifying the one-directional nature of many implications.</description>

      <title>The geometric adjudication of water rights in international rivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the adjudication of water rights in international rivers. We characterize allocation rules that formalize focal principles to deal with water disputes in a basic model. Central to our analysis is a family of geometric rules that implement concatenated transfers downstream. They can be seen as formalizing Limited Territorial Sovereignty, as suggested in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. We apply our rules to the case of the Nile River, with a long history of disputes between downstream and upstream nations</description>

      <title>From No-Regret to Strategically Robust Learning in Repeated Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian single-item auctions, a monotone bidding strategy--one that prescribes a higher bid for a higher value type--can be equivalently represented as a partition of the quantile space into consecutive intervals corresponding to increasing bids. Kumar et al. (2024) prove that agile online gradient descent (OGD), when used to update a monotone bidding strategy through its quantile representation, is strategically robust in repeated first-price auctions: when all bidders employ agile OGD in this way, the auctioneer's average revenue per round is at most the revenue of Myerson's optimal auction, regardless of how she adjusts the reserve price over time.
  In this work, we show that this strategic robustness guarantee is not unique to agile OGD or to the first-price auction: any no-regret learning algorithm, when fed gradient feedback with respect to the quantile representation, is strategically robust, even if the auction format changes every round, provided the format satisfies allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation. In particular, the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal regret guarantee and the best-known strategic robustness guarantee. At a technical level, our results are established via a simple relation that bridges Myerson's auction theory and standard no-regret learning theory. This showcases the potential of translating standard regret guarantees into strategic robustness guarantees for specific games, without explicitly minimizing any form of swap regret.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rating Design under Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimal rating design under moral hazard and strategic manipulation. An intermediary observes a noisy indicator of effort and commits to a rating policy that shapes market beliefs and pay. We characterize optimal ratings via concavification of a gain function. Optimal ratings depends on interaction of effort and risk: for activities that raise tail risk, optimal ratings exhibit lower censorship, pooling poor outcomes to insure and encourage risk-taking; for activities that reduce tail risk, upper censorship increases penalties for negligence. In multi-task environments with window dressing, less informative ratings deter manipulation. In redistributive test design, optimal tests exhibit mid-censorship.</description>

      <title>Flexible Moral Hazard Problems with Adverse Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a moral hazard problem with adverse selection: a risk-neutral agent can directly control the output distribution and possess private information about the production environment. The principal designs a menu of contracts satisfying limited liability. Deviating from classical models, not only can the principal motivate the agent to exert certain levels of aggregate efforts by designing the "power" of the contracts, but she can also regulate the support of the chosen output distributions by designing the "range" of the contract. We show that it is either optimal for the principal to provide a single full-range contract, or the optimal low-type contract range excludes some high outputs, or the optimal high-type contract range excludes some low outputs. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions on when a single full-range contract is optimal under convex effort functions, and show that this condition is also sufficient with general effort functions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an Epidemic with Intervention Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal control of an epidemic governed by a SEIR model with operational delays in vaccination and non pharmaceutical interventions. We address the mathematical challenge of imposing hard healthcare capacity constraints (e.g., ICU limits) over an infinite time horizon. To rigorously bridge the gap between theoretical constraints and numerical tractability, we employ a variational framework based on Moreau--Yosida regularization and establish the connection between finite- and infinite-horizon solutions via $\Gamma$-convergence. The necessary conditions for optimality are derived using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, allowing for the characterization of singular regimes where the optimal strategy maintains the infection level precisely at the capacity boundary. Numerical simulations illustrate these theoretical findings, quantifying the shadow prices of infection and costs associated with intervention delays.</description>
