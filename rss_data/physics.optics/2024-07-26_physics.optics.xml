      <title>Advanced Data Processing of THz-Time Domain Spectroscopy Data with Sinusoidally Moving Delay Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive technical analysis of the data acquisition process with oscillating delay lines for Terahertz time domain spectroscopy. The utilization of these rapid stages, particularly in high-repetition rate systems, permits an effective reduction of noise content through averaging. However, caution must be exercised to optimize the averaging process, with the goal of significantly optimizing the dynamic range (DR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A free and open-source program, called parrot (Processing All Rapidly &amp; Reliably Obtained THz-traces), is provided alongside this publication to overcome the discussed pitfalls and facilitate the acceleration of experimental setups and data analysis, thereby enhancing signal fidelity and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Lightwave-driven electrons in a Floquet topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators offer unique opportunities for novel electronics and quantum phenomena. However, intrinsic material limitations often restrict their applications and practical implementation. Over a decade ago it was predicted that a time-periodic perturbation can generate out-of-equilibrium states known as Floquet topological insulators (FTIs), hosting topologically protected transport and anomalous Hall physics, and opening routes to optically tunable bandstructures and devices compatible with petahertz electronics. Although such states have not yet been directly observed, indirect signatures such as the light-induced anomalous Hall effect were recently measured. Thus far, much remained experimentally unclear and fundamentally unknown about solid-state FTI and whether they can be employed for electronics. Here we demonstrate coherent control of photocurrents in light-dressed graphene. Circularly-polarized laser pulses dress the graphene band structure to obtain an FTI, and phase-locked second harmonic pulses drive electrons in the FTI. This approach allows us to measure resulting all-optical anomalous Hall photocurrents, FTI-valley-polarized currents, and photocurrent circular dichroism, all phenomena that put FTIs on equal footing with equilibrium topological insulators. We further present an intuitive description for the sub-optical-cycle light-matter interaction, revealing dynamical symmetry selection rules for photocurrents. All measurements are supported by strong agreement with ab-initio and analytic theory. Remarkably, the photocurrents show a strong sub-cycle phase-sensitivity that can be employed for ultrafast control in topotronics and spectroscopy. Our work connects Floquet and topological physics with attoscience and valleytronics, and goes beyond band structure engineering by initiating lightwave-driven dynamics in FTI states.</description>

      <title>Observation of robust intrinsic C points generation with magneto-optical bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: C points, characterized by circular polarization in momentum space, play crucial roles in chiral wave manipulations. However, conventional approaches of achieving intrinsic C points using photonic crystals with broken symmetries suffer from low Q factor and are highly sensitive to structural geometry, rendering them fragile and susceptible to perturbations and disorders. In this letter, we report the realization of magneto-optical (MO) bound states in the continuum (BICs) using a symmetry-preserved planar photonic crystal, achieving intrinsic at-{\Gamma} C points that are robust against variation in structural geometry and external magnetic field. MO coupling between two dipole modes induces Zeeman splitting of the eigenfrequencies, leading to MO BICs and quasi-BICs with circular eigenstates for high-Q chiral responses. Furthermore, switchable C point handedness and circular dichroism are enabled by reversing the magnetic field. These findings unveil a new type of BICs with circular eigenstates and on-demand control of C points, paving the way for advanced chiral wave manipulation with enhanced light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid patterns and solitonic frequency combs in non-Hermitian Kerr Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil a new scenario for the formation of dissipative localised structures in nonlinear systems. Commonly, the formation of such structures arises from the connection of a homogeneous steady state with either another homogeneous solution or a pattern. Both scenarios, typically found in cavities with normal and anomalous dispersion, respectively, exhibit unique fingerprints and particular features that characterise their behaviour. However, we show that the introduction of a periodic non-Hermitian modulation in Kerr cavities hybridises the two established soliton formation mechanisms, embodying the particular fingerprints of both. In the resulting novel scenario, the stationary states acquire a dual behaviour, playing the role that was unambiguously attributed to either homogeneous states or patterns. These fundamental findings have profound practical implications for frequency comb generation, introducing unprecedented reversible mechanisms for real-time manipulation.</description>

      <title>On-chip near-infrared spectroscopic sensing with over 520nm bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated spectrometers hold great promise for in-situ, in vitro, and even in vivo near-infrared (NIR) sensing applications. However, practical NIR applications require fine resolution, high accuracy, and mostly importantly, ultra-wide observation window that spans multiple overtone regions, for capturing spectral fingerprints. In this paper, we present an integrated reconstructive spectrometer utilizing dispersion-engineered ring resonators, achieving an over 520 nm operational bandwidth together with a superior resolution of less than 8 pm. This translates into an over 65,000 bandwidth-to-resolution ratio that represents a significant record breakthrough for miniaturized spectrometers. Moreover, we showcase a packaged spectrometer chip with auxiliary electronics, creating a fully functional NIR spectroscopic sensor. Various bandwidth-demanding NIR sensing applications are examined, including the classification of different types of solid substances and the concentration test of aqueous and organic solutions, all achieving approximately 100% accuracy. Specifically, we test the sensor's detection limit using glucose solutions and successfully identify concentrations as low as 0.1% (i.e. 100 mg/dL), which matches that of the commercial benchtop counterparts and sets up a new benchmark for miniaturized spectroscopic sensors.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Coupling in Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are ubiquitous in nature, and in Physics this realization has started to push boundaries by making non-hermiticity a fundamental rather than exceptional property. Despite the prevalence of evanescent coupling in physics, little attention has been paid to wavefunction profiles, with reciprocity often assumed for practical reasons. Our work challenges this assumption by demonstrating the origin of non-reciprocity in a photonic platform. We experimentally validate non-reciprocal dynamics on directional couplers fabricated via femtosecond laser writing, and corroborate our findings through continuous simulations. Extending these insights, we observe the topological Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in a Rice-Mele lattice model. Our findings open new avenues of research using simple and scalable configurations, and potentially guiding future developments in Physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer anti-reflection coats using ePTFE membrane for mm-wavelength plastic optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future millimeter wavelength experiments aim to both increase aperture diameters and broaden bandwidths to increase the sensitivity of the receivers. These changes produce a challenging anti-reflection (AR) design problem for refracting and transmissive optics. The higher frequency plastic optics require consistently thin polymer coats across a wide area, while wider bandwidths require multilayer designs. We present multilayer AR coats for plastic optics of the high frequency BICEP Array receiver (200-300 GHz) utilizing an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, layered and compressively heat-bonded to itself. This process allows for a range of densities (from 0.3g/cc to 1g/cc) and thicknesses (&gt;0.05mm) over a wide radius (33cm), opening the parameter space of potential AR coats in interesting directions. The layered ePTFE membrane has been combined with other polymer layers to produce band average reflections between 0.2% and 0.6% on high density polyethylene and a thin high modulus polyethylene window, respectively.</description>

      <title>Robust Room-Temperature Polariton Condensation and Lasing in Scalable FAPbBr$_3$ Perovskite Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton condensation in direct bandgap semiconductors strongly coupled to light enables a broad range of fundamental studies and applications like low-threshold and electrically driven lasing. Yet, materials hosting exciton-polariton condensation in ambient conditions are rare, with fabrication protocols that are often inefficient and non-scalable. Here, room-temperature exciton-polariton condensation and lasing is observed in a microcavity with embedded formamidiniumlead bromide (FAPbBr$_3$) perovskite film. This optically active material is spin-coated onto the microcavity mirror, which makes the whole device scalable up to large lateral sizes. The sub-$\mu$m granulation of the polycrystalline FAPbBr$_3$ film allows for observation of polariton lasing in a single quantum-confined mode of a polaritonic 'quantum dot'. Compared to random photon lasing, observed in bare FAPbBr$_3$ films, polariton lasing exhibits a lower threshold, narrower linewidth, and an order of magnitude longer coherence time. Both polariton and random photon lasing are observed under the conditions of pulsed optical pumping, and persist without significant degradation for up to 6 and 17 hours of a continuous experimental run, respectively. This study demonstrates the excellent potential of the FAPbBr$_3$ perovskite as a new material for room-temperature polaritonics, with the added value of efficient and scalable fabrication offered by the solution-based spin-coating process.</description>

      <title>Observation of excitonic Floquet states in a one-dimensional organic Mott insulator using mid-infrared pump near-infrared probe reflection spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an electric field of light with a frequency of{\hbar}{\Omega}is applied to a solid, Floquet states, consisting of sidebands with an interval of {\hbar}{\Omega} around an electronic state, are expected to be formed. However, only a few studies have experimentally detected such sidebands. Here, we apply mid-infrared pump near-infrared reflection probe spectroscopy to a one-dimensional Mott insulator, bis(ethylendithio)tetrathianfulvalence-difluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (ET-F2TCNQ), to detect the transient change in reflectivity R,{\Delta}R/R, due to the formation of excitonic Floquet states. Analyses, considering both odd- and even-parity excitons, demonstrate that the {\Delta}R/R spectrum reflects the formation of the first-order Floquet sidebands of excitons, and its spectral shape strongly depends on the widths of excitonic states. The experimental and analytical approach reported here is effective in demonstrating excitonic Floquet states in various solids.</description>

      <title>Design, manufacture and metrology of additively manufactured, metal and ceramic lightweight circular mirror prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spaced-based mirrors are a developing use-case for Additive Manufacturing (AM), the process that builds a part layer-by-layer. The increased geometric freedom results in novel and advantageous designs previously unachievable. Conventionally, mirror fabrication uses subtractive (milling &amp; turning), formative (casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing methods; however, an additive method can simplify an assembly by consolidating individual components into one, and incorporating lattice structures and function optimised geometries to reduce the mass of components, which are beneficial to space-based instrumentation as mass and volume are constrained. Attention must be given to the printability of the design - build orientation and powder/resin removal from lattices and internal cavities are challenges when designing for AM.
  This paper will describe the design, manufacture and metrology of mirror prototypes from the Active Deployable Optical Telescope (ADOT) 6U CubeSat project. The AM mirror is 52mm in diameter, 10mm deep, with a convex 100mm radius of curvature reflective surface and deploys telescopically on three booms. The objectives of the designs were to combine the boom mounting features into the mirror and to lightweight both prototypes by 50% and 70% using internal, thin-walled lattices. Four final lattice designs were downselected through simulation and prototype validation. Prototypes were printed in the aluminium alloy AlSi10Mg using powder bed fusion and fused silica using stereolithography. Aluminium mirrors were single point diamond turned and had surface roughness measurements taken. Fused silica designs were adapted from the aluminium designs and have completed printing.</description>

      <title>Long-lived collective Rydberg excitations in atomic gas achieved via ac-Stark lattice modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive electron physics captured in single-fluid extended MHD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known ponderomotive force, arising from the interaction of matter and light, has critical implications across a broad range of fields from laser fusion and astrophysics to laser diagnostics and even pulsed-power experiments. This pseudo-potential pushes electrons, which through coulomb forces causes ion density modulations that can steepen with profound implications. When used intentionally, density modulations can be used for plasma gratings, which are essential for optical components operating in extreme conditions for next generation lasers. They can also be important for plasma confinement and particle trapping, which can even impact magnetic confinement in fusion devices. The ponderomotive potential also leads to laser self-focusing, complicating laser diagnostics. In laser fusion, the force exacerbates challenges posed by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and crossed beam energy transfer (CBET), both of which destabilize the fusion process. It even plays an astrophysical role in the filamentation of fast radio bursts in the relativistic winds of magnetars. Since the ponderomotive force primarily effects electron dynamics, multi-fluid/particle codes or additional ansatz are required to include its effects. This paper demonstrates that by including electron effects on an ion timescale with a 1-fluid, 2-energy extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) model, ponderomotive effects are also naturally present. We introduce the theory for these dynamics and demonstrate their presence with 1-D pencil-like simulations.</description>
