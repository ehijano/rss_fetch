      <title>Exo-Daisy World: Revisiting Gaia Theory through an Informational Architecture Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights into the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic Information Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between the biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \emph{information architecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel methodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems, including biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological observations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To operationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World model tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets, formulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the co-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this Exo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and environment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these correlations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the coupled systems. This \emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description of the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing detailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new avenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature candidates.</description>

      <title>The low-rank hypothesis of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04848</link>

Abstract: Complex systems are high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems with intricate interactions among their constituents. To make interpretable predictions about their large-scale behavior, it is typically assumed, without a clear statement, that these dynamics can be reduced to a few number of equations involving a low-rank matrix describing the network of interactions -- what we call the low-rank hypothesis. Our paper sheds light on this assumption and questions its validity. By leveraging fundamental theorems on singular value decomposition, we expose the hypothesis for various random graphs, either by making explicit their low-rank formulation or by demonstrating the exponential decrease of their singular values. Notably, we verify the hypothesis experimentally for real networks by revealing the rapid decrease of their singular values, which has major consequences on their effective ranks. We then evaluate the impact of the low-rank hypothesis for general dynamical systems on networks through an optimal dimension reduction. This allows us to prove that recurrent neural networks can be exactly reduced, and to connect the rapidly decreasing singular values of real networks to the dimension reduction error of the nonlinear dynamics they support, be it microbial, neuronal or epidemiological. Finally, we prove that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from the dimension reduction, thus providing theoretical insights into the origin of higher-order interactions in complex systems.</description>
