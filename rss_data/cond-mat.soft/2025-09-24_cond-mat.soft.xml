      <title>Maze-solving with density-driven swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new kind of collective motion where swarms of simple agents are able to find and fix the solution of two-dimensional mazes. The model consists of active memoryless particles interacting exclusively via short-ranged perception of local density and orientations. This system generates traveling density waves when constrained in one dimension, and self-organized swarms exploring local branches in two-dimensional mazes. Depending on a single kinetic parameter, the swarms can develop large tails and further gain long-term persistence, which ultimately allows them to robustly solve mazes of virtually any kind and size. By systematic exploration of the parameter space, we show that there exists a fast solving regime where the resolution time is linear in number of squares, hence making it an efficient maze-solving algorithm. Our model represents a new class of active systems with unprecedented contrast between the minimality of the processed information and the complexity of the resolved task, which is of prime importance for the interpretation and modeling of collective intelligence in living systems as well as for the design of future swarms of active particles and robots.</description>

      <title>Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) particle in the presence of stochastic resetting. Using renewal approach, we compute the mean square displacement (MSD) and position probability distribution functions both in the overdamped and underdamped regimes. In contrast to the normal active OU particle, the MSD of an active OU particle with resetting displays an initial diffusive and long-time or steady-state non-diffusive behavior. The steady-state MSD gets suppressed with an increase in the resetting rate and approaches zero for an infinitely large resetting rate. Moreover, it has a nonmonotonic impact on the duration of activity. For an intermediate range of activity time, the steady-state MSD is enhanced, allowing the particle to explore a larger region, thereby increasing the probability of encountering a wide-spread target. Moreover, when the particle is suspended in a viscoelastic medium characterized by the presence of finite memory, the MSD interestingly develops an intermediate-time plateau and the plateau depends on the strength of the viscoelasticity and the viscoelastic relaxation time. With an increase in strength of the viscoelasticity, the width of the plateau increases and the MSD suppresses. In addition, slow viscoelastic relaxation makes memory effects weaker and hence the intermediate plateau disappears and steady state MSD gets enhanced, implying low strength and longer persistence of memory are beneficial for a wide spread target search. Similarly, for slow resetting, the intermediate plateau is more distinct, whereas fast resetting results in the system approaching steady state faster, overcoming the intermediate plateau in MSD. This emerging behavior might be due to the complex interplay between the resetting mechanism, activity, and memory effects. Finally, our analytical results are in good agreement with numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>A scaling law for large-deformation contact in soft materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compression of soft bodies is central to biology, materials science, and robotics, yet existing contact theories break down at large deformations. Here, we develop a general framework for soft-body compression by extending the method of dimensionality reduction into the nonlinear regime. Analytical solutions for contact force and radius are derived and validated against finite element simulations and experiments on canonical geometries (cone, hemisphere, cylinder), achieving high accuracy up to 50% compression. From this framework emerges a universal scaling law that unifies the nonlinear force-displacement response across diverse shapes and even irregular soft objects such as gummy candies. Leveraging this principle, we design a vision-based tactile sensor that reconstructs real-time pressure maps and enables delicate robotic manipulation of fragile items. By bridging nonlinear contact mechanics with practical sensing, this work both advances fundamental understanding of large-strain mechanics and opens a route to robust tactile technologies for soft robotics and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Chemically Active Liquid Bridges Generate Repulsive Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets help organize cells by compartmentalizing biomolecules and by mediating mechanical interactions. When bridging two structures, such droplets generate capillary forces, which depend on surface properties and distance. While the forces exerted by passive liquid bridges are well understood, the role of active chemical reactions, which are often present in biological droplets, remains unclear. To elucidate this case, we study a single liquid bridge with continuous chemical turnover. These reactions control the bridge radius and lead to purely repulsive forces-contrasting with the typically attractive forces in passive systems. Our results reveal how chemical activity can fundamentally alter forces generated by liquid bridges, which could be exploited by cells.</description>

      <title>Statistics and morphologies of stable droplets in scalar active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional phase segregation is controlled by a positive interfacial tension, which implies that the system relaxes towards a state in which the interfacial area (or length) is minimized, typically manifesting as a single droplet that grows with the system size. Intriguingly, the extension of the underlying Model B paradigm by two non-potential terms (Active Model B+) is able to describe the stable coexistence of many finite droplets. Here we numerical study Active Model B+ in the vicinity of the transition between a single droplet (macrophase segregation) and multiple droplets (microphase segregation). Our results show that, although noise shifts transitions, the overall agreement with the mean-field theoretical predictions is very good. We find a strong correlation of droplet properties with a single parameter that determines the number, density, and the fractal dimension of droplets. Deeper inside the droplet phase we observe another transition to a hexagonal lattice of regular droplets.</description>

      <title>Contraction waves in pulsating active liquids: From pacemaker to aster dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hydrodynamic theory to examine the emergence of contraction waves in dense active liquids composed of pulsating deformable particles. Our theory couples the liquid density with a chemical phase that determines the periodic deformation of the particles. This mechanochemical coupling regulates the interplay between the flow induced by local deformation, and the resistance to pulsation stemming from steric interaction. We show that this interplay leads the emergent contraction waves to spontaneously organize into a packing of pacemakers. We reveal that the dynamics of these pacemakers is governed by a complex feedback between slow and fast topological defects that form asters in velocity flows. In fact, our defect analysis is a versatile platform for investigating the self-organization of waves in a wide range of contractile systems. Our results shed light on the key mechanisms that control the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids, with relevance for biological systems such as tissues made of confluent pulsating cells.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance in driven macroscopic capillary self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic objects supported by surface tension at the fluid interface can self-assemble through the action of capillary forces arising from interfacial deformations. The resulting self-assembled structures are typically ordered but remain trapped in one of potentially many metastable states in the capillary energy landscape in the absence of external forces. In contrast, microscopic colloidal systems leverage both thermal and active fluctuations to overcome energy barriers, enabling transitions between microstates of the system. We herein utilize supercritical Faraday waves to drive structural rearrangements between metastable states of few-particle clusters of millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface. By tracking all microstate transitions experimentally, we find that the system is endowed with a non-zero entropy production rate reflecting broken detailed balance and the system's departure from equilibrium. Our experimental results are in quantitative agreement with simulations of a many-body active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, pointing to universal features of active and driven self-assembly across scales. These findings invite a corresponding investigation at the microscale using colloids that are themselves active or are placed in a wider class of athermal environments such as bacterial baths.</description>

      <title>Effects of Stirring Time on Formation of Microplastics Fragmented from Photo-aged Polypropylene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of microplastic (MP) size distributions fragmented from photo-aged polypropylene (PP) in stirred water. PP specimens fragmented into MPs with their size of 1-30 um after UV irradiation and stirring in laboratory settings. These laboratory-fragmented MPs were dispersed into the water during the stirring process. A series of MP size distributions was analyzed from optical microscope images of obtained MPs. The MP size distribution was described by an exponential function in the short stirring time domain, whereas it changed to a power-law function as the stirring time increased. The fragmentation rate of MPs and nanoplastics (NPs) decreased with increasing stirring time. The obtained MP exhibited higher crystallinity than the photo-aged PP specimen after stirring. This result implies that MP fragmentation, as observed under controlled laboratory conditions, is related with the chemi-crystallization of PP.</description>

      <title>The self-assembly behavior of a diblock copolymer/homopolymer induced by Janus nanorods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ cell dynamics simulation based on the CH/BD model to investigate the self-assembly behavior of a mixed system consisting of diblock copolymers (AB), homopolymers (C), and Janus nanorods. The results indicate that, at different component ratios, the mixed system undergoes various phase transitions with an increasing number of nanorods. Specifically, when the homopolymer component is 0.40, the mixed system transitions from a disordered structure to a parallel lamellar structure, subsequently to a tilted layered structure, and ultimately to a perpendicular lamellar structure as the number of nanorods increases. To explore this phenomenon in greater depth, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of domain sizes and pattern evolution. Additionally, we investigate the effects of the repulsive interaction strength between polymers, wetting strength, length of nanorods, and degree of asymmetry on the self-assembly behavior of the mixed system. This research provides significant theoretical and experimental insights for the preparation of novel nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>The influence of dimensional crossover on phase transitions and critical phenomena in condensed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is aimed at studying the effects of the dimensional crossover (DC) on physical properties of condensed systems near phase transition and critical points. Here we consider the following problems: (1) the theoretical provisions that allow to study the effect of spatial confinement on DC near phase transition and critical points; (2) the study of DC in condensed systems with the Ginzburg number $\mathrm{Gi} &lt;1$, where fluctuation effects are described in different ways at the fluctuation, regular and intermediate (crossover) regions; (3) two types of DC were investigated: (a) a decrease in the linear dimensions $L$ to the values of the correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations leads to the conversion of the dependence on thermodynamic variable into a dependence on linear sizes of 3D systems, as well as (b) a further decrease in linear sizes $L$ the 3D-2D or 3D-1D DC happens depending on slitlike or cylindrical geometry, which is determined by the value of the lower crossover dimensionality $d_{\rm LCD}$; (4) it is proposed to extend the known equalities for critical exponents by using the Mandelbrot formula for fractal dimension $D_f$ as a critical exponent; (5) the influence of 3D-2D DC on the characteristics of the fine structure of the molecular light scattering (MLS) spectrum is studied.</description>

      <title>Active stop and go motion: a strategy to improve spatial exploration and survival</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider active Brownian particles that intermittently switch between active and inactive states. Such behavior is ubiquitous at all scales, from bacteria to animals and in artificial active systems. We derive exact expressions for key transport properties, including velocity autocorrelations and diffusion coefficients, and demonstrate that particle dispersion is highly sensitive to minute details, such as whether the memory of active orientation is retained across a stop event. Extending the model to include minimal metabolic dynamics, we show that the average survival time of the particle is maximized at (i)~an optimal stopping frequency and (ii)~a non-trivial optimal diffusivity, which itself depends on the stopping frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <title>On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.</description>
