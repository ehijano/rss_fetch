      <title>On a pointwise inequality for even Legendre polynomials in high dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pointwise inequality for adjacent even Legendre polynomials in high dimensional spheres featuring the effect of spectral gaps. This improves a recent result of Imbert, Silvestre and Villani that is crucially used in their study of the Fisher information for the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>The best $m$-term trigonometric approximations of the classes of periodic functions of one and many variables in the space $B_{q,1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact order estimates are obtained of the best $m$-term trigonometric approximations of the Nikol'skii-Besov classes $B^r_{p, \theta}$ of periodic functions of one and many variables in the space $B_{q,1}$. In the univariate case ($d=1$), we get the orders of the respective approximation characteristics on the classes $B^r_{p, \theta}$ as well as on the Sobolev classes $W^r_{p, {\boldsymbol{\alpha}}}$ in the space $B_{\infty,1}$ in the case $1\leq p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>A quick guide to ordinary state-dependent delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review $H^{1}$-well-posedness for initial value problems of ordinary differential equations with state-dependent right-hand side. We streamline known approaches to infer existence and uniqueness of solutions for small times given a Lipschitz-continuous prehistory. The paramount feature is a reduction of the differential equation to a fixed point problem that admits a unique solution appealing to the contraction mapping principle. The use of exponentially weighted Sobolev spaces in this endeavor proves to be as powerful as for ordinary differential equations without delay. Our result includes a blow-up criterium for global existence of solutions. The discussion of well-posedness is concluded by new results covering continuous dependence on initial prehistories and on the right-hand sides.</description>

      <title>Nikishin systems on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Nikishin system of $r$ probability measures on the unit circle. We show that such systems satisfy the AT property and therefore normality, introduced in~\cite{KVMLOPUC}, for any multi-index $(n_1,\ldots,n_r)\in\mathbb{N}^r$ with same-parity components satisfying $n_1 \ge n_2 \ge\ldots\ge n_r$. In the case of $r=2$, we demonstrate that the same property holds without requiring $n_1 \ge n_2 \ge\ldots\ge n_r$.
  The analogous simple proof works for Nikishin systems on the real line for indices satisfying $n_j\ge \max\{n_{j+1},\ldots,n_r\}-1$, $j=1,\ldots,r-1$. This is related to the proof by Cousseement and Van Assche for $r=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem for possibly multivalued successor maps associated with planar non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. As an application, we prove the existence of periodic and subharmonic solutions of the scalar second order equation $\ddot x + \lambda g(t,x) = 0$, for $\lambda&gt;0$ sufficiently small, with $g(t,x)$ having a superlinear growth at infinity, without requiring the existence of an equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>The Distance Between the Perturbation of a Convex Function and its $\Gamma$-regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of a non-convex minimization problem by Lachand-Robert and Peletier, they found that the difference between the compactly supported perturbation $u+\epsilon h$ of a strictly convex function $u$, and the $\Gamma$-regularization of $u+\epsilon h$, is at most $o(\epsilon)$. Here we find that this result is optimal, albeit they expected a much stronger estimate.</description>

      <title>A New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws: Convexity Degeneracy of Flux Functions and Fine Properties of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. Our primary aim of this paper is to introduce and validate a novel formula for entropy solutions for this Cauchy problem, specifically tailored to the flux functions satisfying (1.3) which allow the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. This formulation serves as a generalization of the Lax--Oleinik formula that necessitates the flux function to possess uniform convexity. Furthermore, we explore several key applications of this new formula to analyze fine properties of entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem with flux functions allowing for convexity degeneracy and initial data only in $L^\infty$; these especially include: (i) Fine structures of entropy solutions, (ii) Global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions, and (iii) Asymptotic profiles of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$ in both the $L^\infty$-norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$-norm. Through these analyses, we provide a comprehensive understanding of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) allowing the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. Moreover, the new solution formula is extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with initial data in $L^1_{{\rm loc}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve a conjecture of F\"assler and Orponen on the dimension of exceptional projections to one-dimensional subspaces indexed by a space curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We do this by obtaining sharp $L^p$ bounds for a variant of the Wolff circular maximal function over fractal sets for a class of $C^2$ curves related to Sogge's cinematic curvature condition. A key new tool is the use of lens cutting techniques from discrete geometry.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the approximation characteristics of the Nikol'skii-Besov classes of functions with mixed smoothness in the space $B_{q,1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exact-order estimates are obtained for some approximation characteristics of the classes of periodic multivariate functions with mixed smoothness (the Nikol'skii-Besov classes $B^{\boldsymbol{r}}_{p, \theta}$) in the space $B_{q,1}$, $1 \leq p, q \leq \infty$, which norm is stronger than the $L_q$-norm. It is shown, that in the multivariate case (in contrast to the univariate) in most of the considered situations the obtained estimates differ in order from the corresponding estimates in the space $L_q$.
  Besides, a significant progress is made in estimates for the considered approximation characteristics of the classes $B^{\boldsymbol{r}}_{p, \theta}$ in the space $B_{q, 1}$ comparing to the known estimates in the space $L_q$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the conjugate equation driven by two families of finite maps on the unit interval satisfying a compatibility condition. This framework contains de Rham's functional equations. We give sufficient conditions for singularity of the solution with quantitative estimates in the case that the equation is driven by non-affine maps, in particular, linear fractional transformations.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 509 (2022), no. 1, Paper No. 125930) defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication and distribution formulas, and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$.</description>

      <title>Using the Baire Category Theorem to Explore Lions Problem for Quasi-Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many results for Banach spaces also hold for quasi-Banach spaces. One important such example is results depending on the Baire Category Theorem (BCT). We use the BCT to explore Lions problem for a quasi-Banach couple $(A_0, A_1)$. Lions problem, posed in 1960's, is to prove that different parameters $(\theta,p)$ produce different interpolation spaces $(A_0, A_1)_{\theta, p}$. We first establish conditions on $A_0$ and $A_1$ so that interpolation spaces of this couple are strictly intermediate spaces between $A_0+A_1$ and $A_0\cap A_1$. This result, together with a reiteration theorem, gives a partial solution to Lions problem for quasi-Banach couples. We then apply our interpolation result to (partially) answer a question posed by Pietsch. More precisely, we show that if $p\neq p^*$ the operator ideals $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$, $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p^*,q^*}(X,Y)$ generated by approximation numbers are distinct. Moreover, for any fixed $p$, either all operator ideals $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ collapse into a unique space or they are pairwise distinct. We cite counterexamples which show that using interpolation spaces is not appropriate to solve Pietsch's problem for operator ideals based on general $s$-numbers. However, the BCT can be used to prove a lethargy result for arbitrary $s$-numbers which guarantees that, under very minimal conditions on $X,Y$, the space $\mathcal{L}^{(s)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ is strictly embedded into $\mathcal{L}^{\mathcal{A}}(X,Y)$. The paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. A. Pietsch, who passed away recently.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness in the critical regularity setting for hyperbolic systems with partial diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the local existence theory of the Cauchy problem for a general class of symmetrizable hyperbolic partially diffusive systems (also called hyperbolic-parabolic systems) in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\ge 1$. We address the question of well-posedness for large data having critical Besov regularity in the spirit of previous works by the second author on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to the pioneering of Kawashima (S. Kawashima. Systems of a hyperbolic parabolic type with applications to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. PhD thesis, Kyoto University, 1983) and to the more recent work by Serre (D. Serre. Local existence for viscous system of conservation laws: $H^s$-data with $s &gt; 1+d/2$. In Nonlinear partial differential equations and hyperbolic wave phenomena, volume 526 of Contemp. Math., pages 339-358. Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2010), we take advantage of the partial parabolicity of the system to consider data in functional spaces that need not be embedded in the set of Lipschitz functions. This is in sharp contrast with the classical well-posedness theory of (multi-dimensional) hyperbolic systems where it is mandatory. A leitmotiv of our analysis is to require less regularity for the components experiencing a direct diffusion, than for the hyperbolic components. We then use an energy method that is performed on the system after spectral localization and a suitable G\r{a}rding inequality. As an example, we consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>
