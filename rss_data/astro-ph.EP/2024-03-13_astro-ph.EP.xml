      <title>On the survival of the long-lived inner disk of PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDS 70 remains as the best laboratory to investigate the influence of giant planet formation on the structure of the parental disk. One of the most intriguing discoveries is the detection of a resolved inner disk from ALMA observations, extending up to the orbit of PDS 70b. This inner disk is challenging to explain because most of the dust particles are expected to be trapped at the outer edge of the gap open by PDS 70b and PDS 70c. By performing dust evolution models and radiative transfer simulations that match the gas disk masses obtained from recent thermochemical models of PDS 70, we find that when the minimum grain size in the models is larger than 0.1$\mu$m, there is an efficient filtration of dust particles, and the inner disk is depleted during the first million-year of dust evolution. Therefore, to maintain an inner disk, the minimum grain size in the models needs to be smaller than 0.1$\mu$m. Only when grains are that small, they are diffused and dragged along with the gas throughout the planets' gap. The small grains transported in the inner disk grow and drift therein, but the constant reservoir of dust particles that are trapped in the outer edge of the gap and that are continuously fragmenting allows refilling the inner disk on million-year timescales. Our flux predictions at millimetre wavelength of these models agree with ALMA observations. These models predict a spectral index of 3.2 in the outer disk and 3.6 in the inner disk. Our simple analytical calculations show what the inner disk water emission recently observed with JWST may originate from these ice-coated small grains that flow through the gap, grow and drift towards the innermost disk regions, reaching the water snowline. These models may mirror the history and evolution of our Solar System where Jupiter and Saturn played a crucial role shaping the architecture and properties of planets in our Solar System.</description>

      <title>Free-Floating Planets, Survivor Planets, Captured Planets and Binary Planets from Stellar Flybys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study on the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system (with a modest initial planet semi-major axis ratio, $a_1/a_2=0.6-0.8$) experiences stellar flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving-planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs as a function of the pericenter separation of the flyby (in units of the initial planet semi-major axis), and use them to derive the analytical expressions that can be used to compute the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar, while the rate for CPs is a factor of a few smaller. The formation fraction of free-floating BPs depends strongly on $a_1/a_2$ of the initial systems and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than $1\%$ (for systems with $a_1/a_2=0.8$) and typically much smaller ($\lesssim 0.2\%$ for $a_1/a_2\lesssim 0.7$). The fraction remains less than $1\%$ when considering $4M_{\rm J}$ planets. Overall, when averaging over all possible flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than $0.1\%$ of that for FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions of SSPs, CPs and (rare) free-floating BPs. These results can find applications in future studies of exotic planets and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Constrain Tidal Quality Factor from A Non-synchronized Exoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to constrain the tidal quality factor, $Q'$, from a non-synchronized star-planet system consisting of a slowly rotating low-mass star and a close-in Jovian planet, taking into account the tidal interaction and the magnetic braking. On the basis of dynamical system theory, the track of the co-evolution of angular momentum for such a system exhibits the existence of a forbidden region in the $\Omega_\mathrm{orb}$ -- $\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$ plane , where $\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{orb}$ denote the angular velocity of the stellar spin and planetary orbit, respectively. The forbidden region is determined primarily by the strength of the tidal interaction. By comparing ($\Omega_\mathrm{orb},\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$) of a single star-planet system to the forbidden region, we can constrain the tidal quality factor regardless of the evolutionary history of the system. The application of this method to the star-planet system, NGTS-10 -- NGTS-10 b, gives $Q' \gtrsim 10^8$, leading to an tight upper bound on the tidal torque. Since this cannot be explained by previous theoretical predictions for non-synchronized star-planet systems, our result requires mechanisms that suppress the tidal interaction in such systems.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Anomalous Features in Ultra-Large Planetary Remote Sensing Datasets using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has returned petabytes of lunar high spatial resolution surface imagery over the past decade, impractical for humans to fully review manually. Here we develop an automated method using a deep generative visual model that rapidly retrieves scientifically interesting examples of LRO surface imagery representing the first planetary image anomaly detector. We give quantitative experimental evidence that our method preferentially retrieves anomalous samples such as notable geological features and known human landing and spacecraft crash sites. Our method addresses a major capability gap in planetary science and presents a novel way to unlock insights hidden in ever-increasing remote sensing data archives, with numerous applications to other science domains. We publish our code and data along with this paper.</description>

      <title>White dwarf systems: exoplanets and debris disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although there is abundant and diverse observational evidence in support of white dwarf stars hosting planets or debris disks which form in the catastrophic destruction of various planetary bodies, the key processes that explain these observations are still being intensely investigated. The study of white dwarf planetary systems offers a unique perspective on exo-solar composition, that cannot be obtained by any other means. This chapter describes the various observational techniques that are used in order to find and characterize exo-planets and debris disks around white dwarfs. In turn, it discusses how to theoretically interpret these observations by surveying an array of various research tools and models currently employed in this field.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of Jupiter's magnetic field using physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic sounding using data collected from the Juno mission can be used to provide constraints on Jupiter's interior. However, inwards continuation of reconstructions assuming zero electrical conductivity and a representation in spherical harmonics are limited by the enhancement of noise at small scales. In this paper we describe new reconstructions of Jupiter's internal magnetic field based on physics-informed neural networks and either the first 33 (PINN33) or the first 50 (PINN50) of Juno's orbits. The method can resolve local structures, and allows for weak ambient electrical currents. Compared with other methods, our reconstructions of Jupiter's magnetic field both on and above the surface are similar, and we achieve a similar fit to the Juno data. However, our models are not hampered by noise at depth, and so offer a much clearer picture of the interior structure. We estimate that the dynamo boundary is at a fractional radius of 0.8. At this depth, the magnetic field is arranged into longitudinal bands, and the great blue spot appears to be rooted in neighbouring structures of oppositely signed flux.</description>

      <title>Peak-Brightness Localization of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 (IM1) Fireball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent preprint, Fernando et al. (2024) used public data from infrasound stations to constrain the localization of the fireball of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 (IM1) bolide. The analysis inferred a 90-percent-confidence ellipse with semi-minor and semi-major axes of 186 and 388 km, respectively. This large error ellipse includes the much better localization box derived by sensors aboard U.S. Government satellites which detected the fireball light. At the fireball's peak brightness, the CNEOS localization box documented by NASA/JPL measures 11.112km on a side and is centered on a latitude of 1.3S and a longitude of 147.6E. Here, we point out that the recent expedition to retrieve materials from IM1's site (Loeb et al. 2024a,b,c) surveyed a region of tens of km around the CNEOS box center, and was not dictated by the data studied by Fernando et al. (2024) because of its larger uncertainties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The easiest exoplanets to detect are those that orbit very close to their hoststars. As a result, even though these planets are quite rare, they represent amajor fraction of the current exoplanet population. A side-effect of theproximity between the planet and the star is that the two have strong mutualinteractions through a number of physical processes. One of the most importantof these processes is tides. Tides are thought to shape the orbits of close-inexoplanets, heat the planet making its radius expand, and even drive someplanets to spiral into their host stars. This chapter briefly introduces thebasics of tidal physics and describes the various fingerprints tides leavewithin the observed exoplanet population.</description>

      <title>Tidal dissipation of binaries in asteroid pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal dissipation in a celestial body can be used to probe its internal structure. Tides govern the orbital evolution of binary systems and therefore constraints on the interior of binary system members can be derived by knowing the age and tidal state of the binary system. For asteroids, age estimates are challenging due to a lack of direct observation of their surface. However, the age of asteroid pairs formed by rotational fission of a parent body can be derived from dynamical modeling, and as such can be used to constrain the age of binary systems existing within asteroid pairs.We study 13 binary asteroid systems existing in asteroid pairs by modeling their tidal locking and eccentricity damping timescales from tidal dissipation in the primaries and secondaries. We consider the impact of thermal torques on these timescales from the YORP and BYORP effects. The resulting constraints on the tidal dissipation ratio Q/k2 are compared to monolithic and rubble pile asteroid theories, showing that all secondaries are consistent with rubble piles with regolith layers greater than 3m and suggest that Q/k2 for rubble piles increases with radius. A particular case is the first bound secondary of asteroid (3749) Balam, whose Q/k2 is constrained to be between 2.7x10^4 and 1.4x10^6, consistent with a rubble-pile with a regolith thickness between 30m and 100m.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Optical Wavelength Data on Atmospheric Retrievals of Exoplanet Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet transmission spectra provide rich information about the chemical composition, clouds and temperature structure of exoplanet atmospheres. Most exoplanet transmission spectra only span infrared wavelengths ($\gtrsim$ 1 $\rm{\mu m}$), which can preclude crucial atmospheric information from shorter wavelengths. Here, we explore how retrieved atmospheric parameters from exoplanet transmission spectra change with the addition of optical data. From a sample of 14 giant planets with transit spectra from 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, primarily from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, we apply a free chemistry retrieval to planetary spectra for wavelength ranges of 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, 0.6-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, and 1.1-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$. We analyse the posterior distributions of these retrievals and perform an information content analysis, finding wavelengths below 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$ are necessary to constrain cloud scattering slope parameters ($\log{a}$ and $\gamma$) and alkali species Na and K. There is limited improvement in the constraints on the remaining atmospheric parameters. Across the population, we find limb temperatures are retrieved colder than planetary equilibrium temperatures but have an overall good agreement with Global Circulation Models. As JWST extends to a minimum wavelength of 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$, we demonstrate that exploration into complementing JWST observations with optical HST data is important to further our understanding of aerosol properties and alkali abundances in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Slowing of Stellar Differential Rotation by Instability-Driven Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially rotating stars and planets transport angular momentum internally due to turbulence at rates that have long been a challenge to predict reliably. We develop a self-consistent saturation theory, using a statistical closure approximation, for hydrodynamic turbulence driven by the axisymmetric Goldreich--Schubert--Fricke (GSF) instability at the stellar equator with radial differential rotation. This instability arises when fast thermal diffusion eliminates the stabilizing effects of buoyancy forces in a system where a stabilizing entropy gradient dominates over the destabilizing angular momentum gradient. Our turbulence closure invokes a dominant three-wave coupling between pairs of linearly unstable eigenmodes and a near-zero frequency, viscously damped eigenmode that features latitudinal jets. We derive turbulent transport rates of momentum and heat, and provide them in analytic forms. Such formulae, free of tunable model parameters, are tested against direct numerical simulations; the comparison shows good agreement. They improve upon prior quasi-linear or ``parasitic saturation" models containing a free parameter. Given model correspondences, we also extend this theory to heat and compositional transport for axisymmetric thermohaline instability-driven turbulence in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Rotational Evolution of Classical T Tauri Stars: Models and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a grid of stellar rotation models for low-mass and solar-type Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) ($0.3M_{\odot}&lt;M_{\ast}&lt;1.2M_{\odot}$). These models incorporate the star-disk interaction and magnetospheric ejections to investigate the evolution of the stellar rotation rate as a function of the mass of the star $M_{\ast}$, the magnetic field ($B_{\ast}$), and stellar wind ($\dot{M}_{wind}$). We compiled and determined stellar parameters for 208 CTTS, such as projected rotational velocity $v\sin(i)$, mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_{acc}$, stellar mass $M_{\ast}$, ages, and estimated rotational periods using TESS data. We also estimated a representative value of the mass-loss rate for our sample using the $[\text{O}\text{ I}]$ spectral line. Our results confirm that $v\sin(i)$ measurements in CTTS agree with the rotation rates provided by our spin models in the accretion-powered stellar winds (APSW) picture. In addition, we used the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) technique to explore the connection between the model parameters and the observational properties of CTTS. We find that the evolution of $v\sin(i)$ with age might be regulated by variations in (1) the intensity of $B_{\ast}$ and (2) the fraction of the accretion flow ejected in magnetic winds, removing angular momentum from these systems. The youngest stars in our sample ($\sim $1 Myr) show a median branching ratio $\dot{M}_{wind}/\dot{M}_{acc}\sim$ $0.16$ and median $B_{\ast}\sim$ 2000 G, in contrast to $\sim 0.01$ and 1000 G, respectively, for stars with ages $\gtrsim 3$ Myr.</description>

      <title>Precision timing of eclipsing binaries from TESS full frame images. Method and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries (EBs) are expected to be detected in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images (FFIs). This represents a significant increase in the number of EBs available for eclipse timing variation studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of performing precise eclipse timing of TESS EBs using the FFIs. To this end, we developed a fast, automated method and applied it to a sample of $\sim$100 EBs selected from the Villanova TESS EB catalog. Our timing analysis resulted in the detection of ten new triple candidates with outer periods shorter than $\sim$1300$\,$d. For five of them, we were able to constrain the outer orbit by analyzing independently the short-cadence (SC) and FFI data and to derive the minimum mass of the third body with a precision better than 4 per cent for SC and 12 per cent for FFI data. We then compared the results obtained from the two datasets and found that using the FFI data leads to (1) a degradation of both the accuracy and precision of the tertiary mass determination for the tightest EBs and (2) an overall underestimation of the third component's mass. However, we stress that our main conclusions on the nature of the detected signals do not depend on which dataset is used. This confirms the great potential of TESS FFIs, which will allow us to search for rare objects such as substellar circumbinary companions and compact triple stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Transit Photometry as an Exoplanet Discovery Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.07867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometry with the transit method has arguably been the most successful exoplanet discovery method to date. A short overview about the rise of that method to its present status is given. The method's strength is the rich set of parameters that can be obtained from transiting planets, in particular in combination with radial velocity observations; the basic principles of these parameters are given, with explicit formulations for the transit detection probability and the times of transit epochs in comparison to radial velocity epochs. The transit method has however also drawbacks, which are the low probability of properly aligned planet systems and the presence of astrophysical phenomena that may mimic transits and give rise to false detection positives. In the second part, we outline the main factors that determine the design of transit surveys, such as the size of the survey sample, the temporal coverage, the photometric precision, the sample brightness and the methods to extract transit events from observed light curves. Lastly, an overview over past, current, and future transit surveys is given. For these surveys we indicate their basic instrument configuration and their planet catch, including the ranges of planet sizes and stellar magnitudes that were encountered. Current and future transit detection experiments concentrate primarily on bright or special targets, and we expect that the transit method remains a principal driver of exoplanet science, through new discoveries to be made and through the development of new generations of instruments.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems IV: NIRISS Aperture Masking Interferometry Performance and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a performance analysis for the aperture masking interferometry (AMI) mode on board the James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (JWST/NIRISS). Thanks to self-calibrating observables, AMI accesses inner working angles down to and even within the classical diffraction limit. The scientific potential of this mode has recently been demonstrated by the Early Release Science (ERS) 1386 program with a deep search for close-in companions in the HIP 65426 exoplanetary system. As part of ERS 1386, we use the same data set to explore the random, static, and calibration errors of NIRISS AMI observables. We compare the observed noise properties and achievable contrast to theoretical predictions. We explore possible sources of calibration errors and show that differences in charge migration between the observations of HIP 65426 and point-spread function calibration stars can account for the achieved contrast curves. Lastly, we use self-calibration tests to demonstrate that with adequate calibration NIRISS F380M AMI can reach contrast levels of $\sim9-10$ mag at $\gtrsim \lambda/D$. These tests lead us to observation planning recommendations and strongly motivate future studies aimed at producing sophisticated calibration strategies taking these systematic effects into account. This will unlock the unprecedented capabilities of JWST/NIRISS AMI, with sensitivity to significantly colder, lower-mass exoplanets than lower-contrast ground-based AMI setups, at orbital separations inaccessible to JWST coronagraphy.</description>

      <title>Formation and Structure of Circumplanetary Disks and Envelopes during the Late Stages of Giant Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant planets are expected to form within circumstellar disks, which shape their formation history and the local environment. Here, we consider the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks that arise during the late stages of giant planet formation. During this phase, when most of the final mass is accumulated, incoming material enters the Hill sphere and falls toward the planet. In the absence of torques, the falling parcels of gas conserve their specific angular momentum and collect into a circumplanetary disk. Generalizing previous work, we consider a range of possible geometries for the flow entering the sphere of influence of the planet. Specifically, we consider five geometric patterns for the inward flow, ranging from concentration toward the rotational poles of the system to isotropic flow to concentration along the equatorial plane. For each case, we derive analytic descriptions for the density field of the infall region, the disk surface density in the absence of viscosity, and steady-state solutions for viscous disks. These results, in turn, specify the luminosity contributions of the planet, the circumplanetary disk, and the envelope. These power sources, in conjunction with the surrounding material, collectively determine the observational appearance of the forming planet. We conclude with an approximate determination of these radiative signatures.</description>
