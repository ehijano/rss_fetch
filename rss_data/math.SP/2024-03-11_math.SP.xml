      <title>Connection Laplacian on discrete tori with converging property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the spectral properties of the connection Laplacian for both real and discrete tori. We introduce novel methods to examine these eigenvalues by employing parallel orthonormal basis in the pullback bundle on universal covering spaces. Our main results reveal that the eigenvalues of the connection Laplacian on a real torus can be expressed in terms of standard Laplacian eigenvalues, with a unique twist encapsulated in the torsion matrix. This connection is further investigated in the context of discrete tori, where we demonstrate similar results.
  A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to exploring the convergence properties of a family of discrete tori towards a real torus. We extend previous findings on the spectrum of the standard Laplacian to include the connection Laplacian, revealing that the rescaled eigenvalues of discrete tori converge to those of the real torus. Furthermore, our analysis of the discrete torus occurs within a broader context, where it is not constrained to being a product of cyclic groups. Additionally, we delve into the theta functions associated with these structures, providing a detailed analysis of their behavior and convergence.
  The paper culminates in a study of the regularized log-determinant of the connection Laplacian and the converging results of it. We derive formulae for both real and discrete tori, emphasizing their dependence on the spectral zeta function and theta functions.</description>

      <title>Another look at Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition in the regime of fewer Snapshots than Dictionary Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) offers a method for accurately computing the spectral properties of Koopman operators. It achieves this by calculating an infinite-dimensional residual from snapshot data, thus overcoming issues associated with finite truncations of Koopman operators, such as spurious eigenvalues. These spectral properties include spectra and pseudospectra, spectral measures, Koopman mode decompositions, and dictionary verification. In scenarios where there are fewer snapshots than dictionary size, particularly for exact DMD and kernelized EDMD, ResDMD has traditionally been applied by dividing snapshot data into a training set and a quadrature set. Through a novel computational approach of solving a dual least-squares problem, we demonstrate how to eliminate the need for two datasets. We provide an analysis of these new residuals for exact DMD and kernelized EDMD, demonstrating ResDMD's versatility and broad applicability across various dynamical systems, including those modeled by high-dimensional and nonlinear observables. The utility of these new residuals is showcased through three diverse examples: the analysis of cylinder wake, the study of aerofoil cascades, and the compression of transient shockwave experimental data. This approach not only simplifies the application of ResDMD but also extends its potential for deeper insights into the dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Limiting absorption principle for long-range perturbation in the discrete triangular lattice setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete Laplacian acting on a triangular lattice. We perturb the metric and the potential in a long-range way. We aim at proving a Limiting Absorption Principle away the possible embedded eigenvalues. The approach is based on a positive commutator technique.</description>

      <title>On the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>
