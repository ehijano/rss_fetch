      <title>A novel approach to differential expression analysis of co-occurrence networks for small-sampled microbiome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based machine learning methods are useful tools in the identification and prediction of variation in genetic data. In particular, the comprehension of phenotypic effects at the cellular level is an accelerating research area in pharmacogenomics. In this article, a novel graph theoretic approach is proposed to infer a co-occurrence network from 16S microbiome data. The approach is specialised to handle datasets containing a small number of samples. Small datasets exacerbate the significant challenges faced by biological data, which exhibit properties such as sparsity, compositionality, and complexity of interactions. Methodologies are also proposed to enrich and statistically filter the inferred networks. The utility of the proposed method lies in that it extracts an informative network from small sampled data that is not only feature-rich, but also biologically meaningful and statistically significant. Although specialised for small data sets, which are abundant, it can be generally applied to any small-sampled dataset, and can also be extended to integrate multi-omics data. The proposed methodology is tested on a data set of chickens vaccinated against and challenged by the protozoan parasite Eimeria tenella. The raw genetic reads are processed, and networks inferred to describe the ecosystems of the chicken intestines under three different stages of disease progression. Analysis of the expression of network features derive biologically intuitive conclusions from purely statistical methods. For example, there is a clear evolution in the distribution of node features in line with the progression of the disease. The distributions also reveal clusters of species interacting mutualistically and parasitically, as expected. Moreover, a specific sub-network is found to persist through all experimental conditions, representative of a persistent microbiome.</description>

      <title>A mathematical language for linking fine-scale structure in spikes from hundreds to thousands of neurons with behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural recording technology allow simultaneously recording action potentials from hundreds to thousands of neurons in awake, behaving animals. However, characterizing spike patterns in the resulting data, and linking these patterns to behaviour, remains a challenging task. The lack of a rigorous mathematical language for variable numbers of events (spikes) emitted by multiple agents (neurons) is an important limiting factor. We introduce a new mathematical operation to decompose complex spike patterns into a set of simple, structured elements. This creates a mathematical language that allows comparing spike patterns across trials, detecting sub-patterns, and making links to behaviour via a clear distance measure. We apply the method to dual Utah array recordings from macaque prefrontal cortex, where this technique reveals previously unseen structure that can predict both memory-guided decisions and errors in a virtual-reality working memory task. These results demonstrate that this technique provides a powerful new approach to understand structure in the spike times of neural populations, at a scale that will continue to grow more and more rapidly in upcoming years.</description>

      <title>Inferring Leader-Follower Behavior from Presence Data in the Marine Environment: A Case Study on Reef Manta Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social interactions are fundamental in animal groups, including humans, and can take various forms, such as competition, cooperation, or kinship. Understanding these interactions in marine environments has been historically challenging due to data collection difficulties. However, advancements in acoustic telemetry now enable remote analysis of such behaviors. This study proposes a method to derive leader-follower networks from presence data collected by a single acoustic receiver at a specific location.
  Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, the method analyzes lag times between consecutive presences of individuals to infer directed relationships. Tested on simulated data, it was then applied to detection data from acoustically tagged reef manta rays (\textit{Mobula~alfredi}) frequenting a known site. Results revealed temporal patterns, including circadian rhythms and burst-like behavior with power-law distributed time gaps between presences.
  The inferred leader-follower network highlighted key behavioral patterns: females followed males more often than expected, males showed stronger but fewer associations with specific females, and smaller individuals followed others less consistently than larger ones. These findings align with ecological insights, revealing structured social interactions and providing a novel framework for studying marine animal behavior through network theory.</description>

      <title>DiffuPT: Class Imbalance Mitigation for Glaucoma Detection via Diffusion Based Generation and Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by structural damage to the optic nerve head and functional changes in the visual field. Detecting glaucoma early is crucial to preventing loss of eyesight. However, medical datasets often suffer from class imbalances, making detection more difficult for deep-learning algorithms. We use a generative-based framework to enhance glaucoma diagnosis, specifically addressing class imbalance through synthetic data generation. In addition, we collected the largest national dataset for glaucoma detection to support our study. The imbalance between normal and glaucomatous cases leads to performance degradation of classifier models. By combining our proposed framework leveraging diffusion models with a pretraining approach, we created a more robust classifier training process. This training process results in a better-performing classifier. The proposed approach shows promising results in improving the harmonic mean (sensitivity and specificity) and AUC for the roc for the glaucoma classifier. We report an improvement in the harmonic mean metric from 89.09% to 92.59% on the test set of our national dataset. We examine our method against other methods to overcome imbalance through extensive experiments. We report similar improvements on the AIROGS dataset. This study highlights that diffusion-based generation can be of great importance in tackling class imbalances in medical datasets to improve diagnostic performance.</description>

      <title>Navigating Perplexity: A linear relationship with the data set size in t-SNE embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widely used pipelines for analyzing high-dimensional data utilize two-dimensional visualizations. These are created, for instance, via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). A crucial element of the t-SNE embedding procedure is the perplexity hyperparameter. That is because the embedding structure varies when perplexity is changed. A suitable perplexity choice depends on the data set and the intended usage for the embedding. Therefore, perplexity is often chosen based on heuristics, intuition, and prior experience. This paper uncovers a linear relationship between perplexity and the data set size. Namely, we show that embeddings remain structurally consistent across data set samples when perplexity is adjusted accordingly. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results support these findings. This informs the visualization process, guiding the user when choosing a perplexity value. Finally, we outline several applications for the visualization of high-dimensional data via t-SNE based on this linear relationship.</description>
