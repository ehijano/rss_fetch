      <title>JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of the Super-Earth TOI-836b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two transit observations of the ~870K, 1.7R$_E$ super-Earth TOI-836b with JWST NIRSpec/G395H, resulting in a 2.8-5.2$\mu$m transmission spectrum. Using two different reduction pipelines, we obtain a median transit depth precision of 34ppm for Visit 1 and 36ppm for Visit 2, leading to a combined precision of 25ppm in spectroscopic channels 30 pixels wide (~0.02$\mu$m). We find that the transmission spectrum from both visits is well fit by a zero-sloped line by fitting zero-sloped and sloped lines, as well as step functions to our data. Combining both visits, we are able to rule out atmospheres with metallicities &lt;250xSolar for an opaque pressure level of 0.1 bar, corresponding to mean molecular weights to &lt;6gmol$^{-1}$. We therefore conclude that TOI-836b does not have an H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, in possible contrast with its larger, exterior sibling planet, TOI-836c. We recommend that future proposals to observe small planets exercise caution when requiring specific numbers of transits to rule out physical scenarios, particularly for high metallicities and planets around bright host stars, as PandExo predictions appear to be more optimistic than that suggested by the gains from additional transits implied by our data.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution of the Stream of SOHO Kreutz Sungrazers. II. Results and Implications of Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present the results of the first comprehensive effort aimed at modeling a major component of the stream of SOHO sungrazers, 5000 of which have been detected by the onboard coronagraphs since 1996. The stream of Population I of the Kreutz system, investigated by a Monte Carlo simulation technique, is treated as a product of cascading fragmentation due to unstable rotation of a "seed," a subkilometer-sized object that separated with others from comet X/1106 C1 at perihelion. The stream's activity is predicted to last for 200 years from ~1950 to ~2150, culminating in the 2010s, when a swarm of bright SOHO sungrazers (peak mags not fainter than 3) of Population I was observed. By the end of 2023 about 42 percent of the stream had already arrived. Scatter amounts to 7 deg in the longitude of the ascending node and at most 0.2 solar radius in the perihelion distance. On its initial orbit the seed would pass perihelion in 2036, 193 years after C/1843 D1, the principal fragment of X/1106 C1. Comet C/1668 E1 is proposed as another major fragment and yet another is predicted to arrive in the 2050s or 2060s.</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: A NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Spectrum of the Sub-Neptune TOI-836c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune are the most common in the Galaxy, bridging the gap between the terrestrial and giant planets in our Solar System. Now that we are firmly in the era of JWST, we can begin to measure, in more detail, the atmospheres of these ubiquitous planets to better understand their evolutionary trajectories. The two planets in the TOI-836 system are ideal candidates for such a study, as they fall on either side of the radius valley, allowing for direct comparisons of the present-day atmospheres of planets that formed in the same environment but had different ultimate end states. We present results from the JWST NIRSpec G395H transit observation of the larger and outer of the planets in this system, TOI-836c (2.587 R$_{\oplus}$, 9.6 M$_{\oplus}$, T$_{\rm eq}$$\sim$665 K). While we measure average 30-pixel binned precisions of $\sim$24ppm for NRS1 and $\sim$43ppm for NRS2 per spectral bin, we do find residual correlated noise in the data, which we attempt to correct using the JWST Engineering Database. We find a featureless transmission spectrum for this sub-Neptune planet, and are able to rule out atmospheric metallicities $&lt;$175$\times$ Solar in the absence of aerosols at $\lesssim$1 millibar. We leverage microphysical models to determine that aerosols at such low pressures are physically plausible. The results presented herein represent the first observation from the COMPASS (Compositions of Mini-Planet Atmospheres for Statistical Study) JWST program, which also includes TOI-836b and will ultimately compare the presence and compositions of atmospheres for 12 super-Earths/sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Hydrogen and Ice Loss Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain the overall equilibrium-temperature-dependent trend in the exoplanet mass-radius diagram, using the escape mechanisms of hydrogen and relevant volatiles, and the chemical equilibrium calculation of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) break-up into atomic hydrogen (H). We identify two Cosmic Hydrogen and Ice Loss Lines (CHILLs) in the mass-radius diagram. Gas disks are well known to disperse in ten million years. However, gas-rich planets may lose some or almost all gas on a much longer timescale. We thus hypothesize that most planets that are born out of a hydrogen-gas-dominated nebular disk begin by possessing a primordial H$_2$-envelope. This envelope is gradually lost due to escape processes caused by host-stellar radiation.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Induced Ice Compaction and Subsurface Porosity on Icy Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of the surface porosity of icy moons and its evolution with depth remains limited, including the precise scale at which ice compaction occurs under self-weight pressure. This parameter is of crucial interest for the correct interpretation of current remote sensing data (spectroscopy in the visible, infrared to passive microwave) but also for planetary exploration when designing a lander, a rover or a cryobot. In situ exploration of the ice crust would require knowledge about subsurface porosity. This study employs a compaction model solely driven by overburden pressure based on prior research. The formulation for density as a function of depth, incorporates an essential parameter: the ice compaction coefficient. To determine this coefficient, we fit our depth-dependent density model to existing data obtained from Earth-based measurements of ice cores in Antarctica and North Greenland. Our results yield a typical lengthscale for ice compaction on Earth of approximately 20.1 $\pm$ 0.6 m , consistent with the existing literature. We apply the model to Europa, which due to its lower gravity, has a typical ice compaction scale of 150 $\pm$ 4 m. We compare it with the depths scanned by current spaceborne data and find that porosity can be considered constant when accounting only for gravity-induced compaction.</description>

      <title>Quantitative grain size estimation on airless bodies from the negative polarization branch. II. Dawn mission targets (4) Vesta and (1) Ceres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Sunlight scattered from the surface of an airless body is generally partially polarized, and the corresponding polarization state includes information about the scattering surface, such as albedo, surface grain sizes, composition, and taxonomic types. Aims. We conducted polarimetry of two large airless bodies, the Dawn mission targets (1) Ceres and (4) Vesta, in the near-infrared region. We further investigated the change in the polarimetric phase curves over the wavelengths expected from previous works. Methods. We used the Nishiharima Infrared Camera (NIC) installed at the Nishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory (NHAO) to observe these objects at multiple geometric configurations in the J, H, and $\mathrm{K_s}$ bands ($ \lambda \sim 1.2\mathrm{-}2.3 \mathrm{\mu m} $). Results. Polarimetric parameters were determined and compared with previously reported experimental results. In particular, Vesta exhibits a characteristic change in the negative polarization branch as the wavelength increases to the $\mathrm{K_s}$ band, which we interpret as an indication of the dominant existence of $D \sim 10\mathrm{-}20 \mathrm{\mu m}$ particles. Our approach is supported by empirical reasoning and coincides well with an independent, theory-driven approach based on thermal modeling. Conclusions. This work demonstrates how near-infrared polarimetry can be utilized to quantitatively determine the particle size of airless objects. This finding will have important implications for asteroid taxonomy and regolith evolution.</description>

      <title>Signs of magnetic star-planet interactions in HD 118203. TESS detects stellar variability that matches the orbital period of a close-in eccentric Jupiter-sized companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary systems with close-in giant planets can experience magnetic star-planet interactions that modify the activity levels of their host stars. The induced activity is known to strongly depend on the magnetic moment of the interacting planet. Therefore, such planet-induced activity should be more readily observable in systems with planets in eccentric orbits, since those planets are expected to rotate faster than in circular orbits. However, no evidence of magnetic interactions has been reported in eccentric systems to date. We intend to unveil a possible planet-induced activity in the bright ($V$ = 8.05 $\pm$ 0.03 mag) and slightly evolved star HD 118203, which hosts an eccentric ($e$ = 0.32 $\pm$ 0.02) and close-in ($a$ = 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0006 au) Jupiter-sized planet. We characterized the system by modelling 56 ELODIE radial velocities and four sectors of TESS photometry. We searched for planet-induced and rotation-related activity signals within the TESS, ELODIE, and ASAS-SN public data. We studied the possible origins of the variability found, analysed its persistence and evolution, and searched for links with the eccentric orbital motion of HD 118203 b. We found evidence of an activity signal within the TESS data that matches the orbital period of HD 118203 b, which suggests the existence of magnetic star-planet interactions. We did not find, however, any additional signal that could be interpreted as the rotation of the star, so we cannot discard stellar rotation as the source of the signal found. Nevertheless, the evolved nature of the star and the orbital eccentricity make the synchronous stellar rotation very unlikely. HD 118203 represents the best evidence that magnetic star-planet interactions can be found in eccentric systems, and it opens the door to future dedicated searches that will allow us to better understand the interplay between close-in planets and their hosts.</description>

      <title>A Surface Hydrothermal Source of Nitriles and Isonitriles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant impacts can generate transient hydrogen-rich atmospheres, reducing atmospheric carbon. The reduced carbon will form hazes that rain out onto the surface and can become incorporated into the crust. Once heated, a large fraction of the carbon would be converted into graphite. The result is that local regions of the Hadean crust were plausibly saturated with graphite. We explore the consequences of such a crust for a prebiotic surface hydrothermal vent scenario. We model a surface vent fed by nitrogen-rich volcanic gas from high-temperature magmas passing through graphite-saturated crust. We consider this occurring at pressures of 1-1000 bar and temperatures of 1500-1700 degC. The equilibrium with graphite purifies the left-over gas, resulting in substantial quantities of nitriles (0.1% HCN and 1 ppm HC3N) and isonitriles (0.01% HNC) relevant for prebiotic chemistry. We use these results to predict gas-phase concentrations of methyl isonitrile of ~ 1 ppm. Methyl isocyanide can participate in the non-enzymatic activation and ligation of the monomeric building blocks of life, and surface, or shallow, hydrothermal environments provide its only known equilibrium geochemical source.</description>
