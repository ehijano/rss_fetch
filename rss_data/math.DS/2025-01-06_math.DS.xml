      <title>Decomposition of discontinuous flows of diffeomorphisms: jumpings, geometrical and topological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact manifold equipped with a pair of complementary foliations, say horizontal $\mathcal{H}$ and vertical $\mathcal{V}$. In Melo, Morgado and Ruffino (Disc Cont Dyn Syst B, 2016, 21(9)) it is proved that if a semimartingale $X_t$ has a finite number of jumps in compact intervals then, up to a stopping time $\tau$, a stochastic flow of local diffeomorphisms in $M$ driven by $X_t$ can be decomposed into a process in the Lie group of diffeomorphisms which fix the leaves of $\mathcal{H}$ composed with a process in the Lie group of diffeomorphisms which fix the leaves of $\mathcal{V}$. Dynamics at the discontinuities of $X_t$ here are interpreted in the Marcus sense as in Kurtz, Pardoux and Protter \cite{KPP}. Here we enlarge the scope of this geometric decomposition and consider flows driven by arbitrary semimartingales with jumps and show explicit equations for each component. Our technique is based in an extension of the It\^o-Ventzel-Kunita formula for stochastic flows with jumps. Geometrical and others topological obstructions for the decomposition are also considered: e.g. an index of attainability is introduced to measure the complexity of the dynamics with respect to the pair of foliations.</description>

      <title>On Shilnikov's scenario in 3D: Topological chaos for vectorfields of class $C^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shilnikov's scenario in 3D consists of a vectorfield $V$ so that the equation $$ x'(t)=V(x(t))\in\mathbb{R}^3 $$ with $V(0)=0$ has a solution homoclinic to the origin and the eigenvalues of $DV(0)$ are $u&gt;0$ and $\sigma\pm i\mu$, $\sigma&lt;0&lt;\mu$, with $0&lt;\sigma+u$. We give a detailed proof that close to the homoclinic loop complicated motion exists provided $V$ is just once continuously differentiable. The result requires working with flows instead of an ODE, which necessitates major modifications compared to the earlier approach for twice continuously differentiable vectorfields in arXiv:2406.18289 .</description>

      <title>Thermostats without conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Hopf's theorem to thermostats: the total thermostat curvature of a thermostat without conjugate points is non-positive, and vanishes only if the thermostat curvature is identically zero. We further show that, if the thermostat curvature is zero, then the flow has no conjugate points, and the Green bundles collapse almost everywhere. Given a thermostat without conjugate points, we prove that the Green bundles are transversal everywhere if and only if it admits a dominated splitting. Finally, we provide an example showing that Hopf's rigidity theorem on the 2-torus cannot be extended to thermostats. It is also the first example of a thermostat with a dominated splitting which is not Anosov.</description>

      <title>Continuity of asymptotic entropy on wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the continuity of asymptotic entropy as a function of the step distribution for non-degenerate probability measures with finite entropy on wreath products $ A \wr B = \bigoplus_B A \rtimes B $, where $A$ is any countable group and $B$ is a countable hyper-FC-central group that contains a finitely generated subgroup of at least cubic growth. As one step in proving the above, we show that on any countable group $G$ the probability that the $\mu$-random walk on $G$ never returns to the identity is continuous in $\mu$, for measures $\mu$ such that the semigroup generated by the support of $\mu$ contains a finitely generated subgroup of at least cubic growth. Finally, we show that among random walks on a group $G$ that admit a separable completely metrizable space $X$ as a model for their Poisson boundary, the weak continuity of the associated harmonic measures on $X$ implies the continuity of the asymptotic entropy. This result recovers the continuity of asymptotic entropy on known cases, such as Gromov hyperbolic groups and acylindrically hyperbolic groups, and extends it to new classes of groups, including linear groups and groups acting on $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Very well approximable matrices are singular on average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish upper bounds on the dimension of sets of singular-on-average and $\omega$-singular affine forms in singly metric settings, where either the matrix or the shift is fixed. These results partially address open questions posed by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba\'nski, as well as Kleinbock and Wadleigh. Furthermore, we extend our results to the generalized weighted setup and derive bounds for the intersection of these sets with a wide class of fractals. Combined with the results of Chow, Ghosh, Guan, Marnat, and Simmons, our results shows that very well approximable matrices are singular on average.</description>

      <title>Borel complexity of the family of attractors for weak IFSs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to measure the difference between the family of iterated function systems attractors and a broader family, the set of attractors for weak iterated function systems. We discuss Borel complexity of the set wIFS$^d$ of attractors for weak iterated function systems acting on $[0,1]^d$ (as a subset of the hyperspace $K([0,1]^d)$ of all compact subsets of $[0,1]^d$ equipped in the Hausdorff metric). We prove that wIFS$^d$ is $G_{\delta\sigma}$-hard in $K([0,1]^d)$, for all $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, wIFS$^d$ is not $F_{\sigma\delta}$ (in contrast to the family IFS$^d$ of attractors for classical iterated function systems acting on $[0,1]^d$, which is $F_{\sigma}$). Moreover, we show that in the one-dimensional case, wIFS$^1$ is an analytic subset of $K([0,1])$.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the sets of attractors for systems of contractions and weak contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $n,d\in\mathbb{N}$ we consider the families: - $L_n^d$ of attractors for iterated function systems (IFS) consisting of $n$ contractions acting on $[0,1]^d$, - $wL_n^d$ of attractors for weak iterated function systems (wIFS) consisting of $n$ weak contractions acting on $[0,1]^d$. We study closures of the above families as subsets of the hyperspace $K([0,1]^d)$ of all compact subsets of $[0,1]^d$ equipped in the Hausdorff metric. In particular, we show that $\overline{L_n^d}=\overline{wL_n^d}$ and $L_{n+1}^d\setminus\overline{L_n^d}\neq\emptyset$, for all $n,d\in\mathbb{N}$. What is more, we construct a compact set belonging to $\overline{L_2^d}$ which is not an attractor for any wIFS. We present a diagram summarizing our considerations.</description>

      <title>Porosities of the sets of attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is another attempt to measure the difference between the family $A[0,1]$ of attractors for iterated function systems acting on $[0,1]$ and a broader family, the set $A_w[0,1]$ of attractors for weak iterated function systems acting on $[0,1]$.
  It is known that both $A[0,1]$ and $A_w[0,1]$ are meager subsets of the hyperspace $K([0,1])$ (of all compact subsets of $[0,1]$ equipped in the Hausdorff metric). Actually, $A[0,1]$ is even $\sigma$-lower porous while the question about $\sigma$-lower porosity of $A_w[0,1]$ is still open.
  We prove that $A[0,1]$ is not $\sigma$-strongly porous in $K([0,1])$. Moreover, we show that $A_w[0,1]\setminus A[0,1]$ is dense in $K([0,1])$.</description>

      <title>The near-parabolic geometry of external rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Lavaurs maps and near-parabolic renormalization, we describe the degenerating geometry of external rays for quadratic polynomials when a periodic cycle becomes parabolic. We similarly describe the geometry of parameter rays for the Mandelbrot set near parabolic points. Using this geometric control we establish new bounds on the size of limbs of the Mandelbrot set, for example providing a quadratic Pommerenke-Levin-Yoccoz inequality in the near-parabolic setting.</description>

      <title>Contraction and Synchronization in Reservoir Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the conditions under which global contraction manifests in the leaky continuous time reservoirs, thus guaranteeing generalized synchronization. Results on continuous time reservoirs make use of the logarithmic norm of the connectivity matrix. Further analysis yields some simple guidelines on how to better construct the connectivity matrix in these systems. Additionally, we outline how the universal approximation property of discrete time reservoirs is readily satisfied by virtue of the activation function being contracting, and how continuous time reservoirs may inherit a limited form of universal approximation due to their overlap with neural ordinary differential equations. The ability of the reservoir computing framework to universally approximate topological conjugates, along with their fast training, make them a compelling data-driven, black-box surrogate of dynamical systems, and a potential candidate for a component of digital twins.</description>
