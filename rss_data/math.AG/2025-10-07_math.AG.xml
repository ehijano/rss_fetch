      <title>Vanishing theorems for combinatorial geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish strong vanishing theorems for line bundles on wonderful varieties of hyperplane arrangements, and we show that the resulting positivity properties of Euler characteristics extend to all matroids. We achieve this by showing that every degeneration of a wonderful variety within the permutohedral toric variety is reduced and Cohen--Macaulay. The same holds for a larger class of subschemes in products of projective lines that we call "kindred," which are characterized by matroidal Hilbert polynomials. Our results give a new proof of the 20-year-old f-vector conjecture of Speyer and resolve the conjecture of Tohaneanu that higher order Orlik--Terao algebras are Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Hadamard ranks of algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of decompositions of tensors as Hadamard products (i.e., coefficient-wise products) of low-rank tensors, we introduce the notion of Hadamard rank of a given point with respect to a projective variety: if it exists, it is the smallest number of points in the variety such that the given point is equal to their Hadamard product. We prove that if the variety $X$ is not contained in a coordinate hyperplane or a binomial hypersurface, then the generic point has a finite $X$-Hadamard-rank. Although the Hadamard rank might not be well defined for special points, we prove that the general Hadamard rank with respect to secant varieties of toric varieties is finite and the maximum Hadamard rank for points with no coordinates equal to zero is at most twice the generic rank. In particular, we focus on Hadamard ranks with respect to secant varieties of toric varieties since they provide a geometric framework in which Hadamard decompositions of tensors can be interpreted. Finally, we give a lower bound to the dimension of Hadamard products of secant varieties of toric varieties: this allows us to deduce the general Hadamard rank with respect to secant varieties of several Segre-Veronese varieties.</description>

      <title>Geometric Construction of Quiver Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a classic theorem of Beilinson, the perfect derived category $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$ of projective space is equivalent to the category of derived representations of a certain quiver with relations. The vertex-wise tensor product of quiver representations corresponds to a symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ on $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$. We prove that, for a certain choice of equivalence, the symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ may be described geometrically as an \emph{extended convolution product} in the sense that the Fourier--Mukai kernel is given by the closure of the torus multiplication map in $(\mathbb{P}^n)^3$. We also set up a general framework for such problems, allowing us to generalize the extended convolution description of quiver tensor products to the case where $\mathbb{P}^n$ is replaced by any smooth complete toric variety of Bondal--Ruan type. Under toric mirror symmetry, this extended convolution product corresponds to the tensor product of constructible sheaves on a real torus. As another generalization of our results for $\mathbb{P}^n$, we show that any finite-dimensional algebra $A$ gives rise to a monoidal structure $\star_A'$ on $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}(A))$, providing insights into the moduli of monoidal structures on $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for singular double cover Calabi--Yau varieties: quantum test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study on the pairs of singular Calabi--Yau varieties arising from double covers over semi-Fano toric manifolds. In this paper, we first investigate singular CY double covers of \(\mathbb{P}^{3}\) branched along (1) a union of eight hyperplanes in general position, and (2) a union of four hyperplanes and a quartic in generation. Our previous construction produces hypothetical singular mirror partners. We prove that they are mirror pairs in the sense that the \(B\)-model of one (variation of Hodge structure) is equivalent to the \(A\)-model of another (the untwisted part of the genus zero orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants). The technique can be generalized and applied to the case when the nef-partition is trivial. As a byproduct, we also verify Morrison's conjecture in certain circumstances.</description>

      <title>Fiberwise Gromov-Witten theory, quantum spectra of flag bundles, and prime factorization of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the vertical quantum cohomology and quantum spectra of flag bundles, uncovering new links between the Gromov-Witten theory of homogeneous fibrations and analytic number theory. Building on previous constructions by Astashkevich and Sadov (arXiv:hep-th/9401103) and by Biswas, Das, Oh, and Paul (arXiv:2408.06616), we establish functorial and inductive properties of vertical quantum cohomology, and relate the vertical and absolute quantum spectra. We show that the degeneracy of the small vertical quantum spectrum of a Grassmann bundle - namely, the appearance of eigenvalues with unexpectedly high multiplicities - is controlled by the prime factorization of the involved ranks. This extends earlier results for Grassmannians to the relative setting and applies, in particular, to partial flag varieties viewed as total spaces of Grassmann bundles.
  We then introduce three families of double sequences that classify partial flag varieties according to distinct quantum spectral and combinatorial features. Their recursive and arithmetic behavior is studied through ordinary and Dirichlet generating functions. One of these sequences satisfies a Pascal-type recursion, allowing a precise analysis of its partial Dirichlet series, whose analytic continuation exhibits logarithmic singularities determined by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, for any fixed integer shift, the diagonal subsequences display eventual polynomial behavior, which admits a natural interpretation in terms of weighted walks on graphs. Finally, we examine the vanishing pattern of one of these sequences and derive equivalent formulations of Goldbach's conjecture.
  Overall, the paper reveals a rich correspondence between enumerative geometry, quantum spectral degeneracy, and classical problems in prime number theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the computation of the invariant $\eta(\omega,C,a)$ defined in arXiv:2409.01751 to special points on the line at infinity and show that, as in the affine case, its value is determined purely by the geometry of the integral curve C. By incorporating points at infinity, the invariant $\eta$ yields effective geometric criteria that certify Darboux integrability in cases not covered by affine data alone. As an application we construct six new codimension-11 components of the degree-3 center variety</description>

      <title>Power Towers: Purely Inseparable Galois Theory and Foliations in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a purely inseparable Galois theory using non-derived commutative algebra. Our theory works on fields and on normal varieties. It says that a purely inseparable morphism corresponds to a finite (saturated) subalgebra of differential operators. Our approach unifies most of the literature about purely inseparable morphisms and shows new research directions.
  Indeed, our theory extends to a theory that covers all (saturated) subalgebras of differential operators. The extended theory gives a correspondence between the subalgebras and a new notion of \textbf{power towers}. A power tower is an object analogous to a foliation from differential geometry. In particular, it admits its own versions of many key results about foliations, such as a ``fibrations inject into foliations'' and a ``Frobenius theorem''. The latter has a nontrivial twist: the local structure is trivial at every point, but it may differ between points!
  In general, our analogy between power towers and foliations explains why purely inseparable morphisms are foliation-like, because these morphisms are power towers in an explicit way.
  Finally, we use our theory to produce a formula for pullbacks of canonical divisors for arbitrary purely inseparable morphisms. We use it to conclude some ``not-L{\"u}roth theorems'': if the characteristic is high enough, then any variety purely inseparably covered by an $n$-dimensional projective space has Iitaka dimension equal to $-\infty$ or $n$, i.e., it is not zero.</description>

      <title>On algebro-geometric quotients of torus-invariant subvarieties of the flag varietiy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the subvarieties of a complex flag variety that are invariant under the action of a maximal torus. Using combinatorial techniques derived from matroid theory, we introduce a decomposition of this variety into affine, locally closed subsets, which we refer to as \textit{thin Schubert cells}, each indexed by an element of a Cartesian product of matroids. We also show that the set of orbits for each of these thin Schubert cells under the action of the torus is, in fact, an orbit space, which gives rise to topologically trivial fiber bundles. As a consequence of this, we prove the existence of algebro-geometric quotients in the sense of Mumford's \textit{Geometric Invariant Theory}. The main result of this work is the existence of a surjective map from the set of geometric quotients of thin Schubert cells to the invariant scheme-theoretic points of a complex flag variety, which allows us to decompose it in terms of such quotients and also define a map from the set of these geometric quotients to the invariant homology of the variety. Finally, we give a complete description of the thin Schubert cells for the special case of the flag variety $\mathds{F}_{1&lt;n-1}(\mathds{C}^n)$ and derive explicit counting formulas.</description>

      <title>Artin--Mazur formal groups and Milne duality via unipotent spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the notion of "unipotent spectra." This is defined to be the stabilization of To\"en's category of affine stacks, and is related to recent work of Mondal--Reinecke. Unipotent spectra give rise to unipotent stable homotopy groups and unipotent homology, which are new invariants for schemes valued in unipotent group schemes. As applications, we recover the Artin--Mazur formal groups associated to schemes without any vanishing assumptions. Further, we show that syntomic cohomology admits a natural refinement to a perfect unipotent spectrum. Finally, we extend Milne's work on arithmetic duality theorems to the category of perfect unipotent spectra and apply it to refine Poincar\'e duality in syntomic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Window categories for a simple $9$-fold flop of Grassmannian type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local simple $9$-fold flop of Grassmannian type is a birational transformation between total spaces of vector bundles on the Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2, 5)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3, 5)$. We produce four different derived equivalences which commute with the pushforward functors for the flopping contractions. These equivalences are realized by identifying four different window categories inside the derived category of coherent sheaves on an Artin stack. As an application, our approach provides a new proof of derived equivalence for a pair of non-birational Calabi-Yau threefolds realized as zero loci of sections of homogeneous vector bundles in Grassmannians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the relative stability threshold of a family of Fano varieties over a DVR and show that it is computed by a divisorial valuation. In the case when the special fiber is K-unstable, but the generic fiber is K-semistable, we use the divisorial valuation computing the threshold to replace the special fiber by a new one with a strictly larger stability threshold. Iterating this process yields a new and more direct proof of the properness of the K-moduli space that uses only birational geometry arguments.</description>

      <title>Splittings of Ideals of Points in $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I_\mathbb{X}$ be the bihomogeneous ideal of a finite set of points $\mathbb{X} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. The purpose of this note is to consider ``splittings'' of the ideal $I_\mathbb{X}$, that is, finding ideals $J$ and $K$ such that $I_\mathbb{X} = J+K$, where $J$ and $K$ have prescribed algebraic or geometric properties. We show that for any set of points $\mathbb{X}$, we cannot partition the generators of $I_\mathbb{X}$ into two ideals of points. The best case scenario is where at most one of $J$ or $K$ is an ideal of points. To remedy this we introduce the notion of unions of lines and ACM (Arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay) points which allows us to say more about splittings. For a set $\mathbb{W}$ of unions of lines and ACM sets of points, we can write $I_\mathbb{W} = J + K$ where both $J$ and $K$ are ideals of unions of lines and ACM points as well. When $\mathbb{W}$ is a union of lines and ACM points, we discuss some consequences for the graded Betti numbers of $I_{\mathbb{W}}$ in terms of these splittings.</description>

      <title>Cluster theory of topological Fukaya categories. Part II: Higher Teichm\"uller theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct relative $3$-Calabi--Yau categories related with higher Teichm\"uller theory. We further study their corresponding cosingularity categories and the additive categorification of the corresponding cluster algebras.
  The input for our constructions is a marked surface with boundary and a Dynkin quiver $I$. In the case of the triangle, these categories have been described in recent work of Keller--Liu. For general surfaces, the categories are constructed via gluing along a perverse schober, categorifying the amalgamation of cluster varieties. The case $I=A_1$ was subject of the prequel paper. We show that the cosingularity category is equivalent to the corresponding Higgs category and to the topological Fukaya category of the marked surface valued in the $1$-Calabi--Yau cluster category of type $I$.</description>

      <title>$q$-de Rham cohomology and topological Hochschild homology over ku</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hodge-filtered derived de Rham cohomology of a ring $R$ can be described (up to completion and shift) as the graded pieces of the even filtration on $\mathrm{HC}^-(R)$. In this paper we show a deformation of this result: If $R$ admits a spherical $\mathbb{E}_2$-lift, then the graded pieces of the even filtration on $\mathrm{TC}^-(\mathrm{ku}\otimes\mathbb{S}_R/\mathrm{ku})$ form a certain filtration on the $q$-de Rham cohomology of $R$, which $q$-deforms the Hodge filtration. We also explain how the associated Habiro-Hodge complex can be described in terms of the genuine equivariant structure on $\mathrm{THH}(\mathrm{KU}\otimes\mathbb{S}_R/\mathrm{KU})$. As a special case, we'll obtain homotopy-theoretic construction of the Habiro ring of a number field of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier.</description>

      <title>On the generating series of the degree sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generating series associated with the degree sequence of a monomial self-map of a projective toric variety. We establish conditions under which this series has its circle of convergence as a natural boundary, and hence is a transcendental, non-holonomic function. In the case of toric surfaces, our results are sharp; moreover, we answer a question of Bell by proving that their reductions modulo $p$ are transcendental for all but finitely many prime numbers $p$.</description>

      <title>Chern classes from Morava K-theories to $p^n$-typical oriented theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.09050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-additive operations from algebraic Morava K-theories to oriented cohomology theories in algebraic geometry. For oriented cohomology theory $A$ that has a {$p^n$}-typical formal group law over a $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra we construct `Chern classes' from the algebraic $n$-th Morava K-theory with $p$-local coefficients to $A$. If the coefficient ring of $A$ is a free $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-module we also prove that these Chern classes freely generate all operations from $\mathrm{K}(n)$ to $A$.
  Examples of such theories are algebraic Morava K-theories $\mathrm{K}(nm)^*$ for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and Chow groups with $p$-local coefficients. The universal $p^n$-typical oriented theory is $BP\{n\}^*$ whose coefficient ring is also a free $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-module.
  Chern classes from the $n$-th algebraic Morava K-theory $\mathrm{K}(n)$ to itself allow us to introduce the gamma filtration on $\mathrm{K}(n)$. This is the best approximation to the topological filtration obtained by values of operations and it satisfies properties similar to that of the classical gamma filtration on $\mathrm{K}_0$. The major difference from the classical case
  is that Chern classes from the graded factors $gr^i_\gamma \mathrm{K}(n)^*$ to Chow groups with p-local coefficients are surjective for $i\le p^n$, which allows to estimate $p$-torsion in Chow groups of codimension up to $p^n$ of some varieties.</description>

      <title>Low degree Hurwitz stacks in the Grothendieck ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $2 \leq d \leq 5$, we show that the class of the Hurwitz space of smooth degree $d$, genus $g$ covers of $\mathbb P^1$ stabilizes in the Grothendieck ring of stacks as $g \to \infty$, and we give a formula for the limit. We also verify this stabilization when one imposes ramification conditions on the covers, and obtain a particularly simple answer for this limit when one restricts to simply branched covers.</description>

      <title>Theory of weights for log convergent cohomologies I: the case of a proper smooth scheme with an SNCD in characteristic p&gt;0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using log convergent topoi, %In the derived category of filtered complexes of %sheaves of modules over %an isostructure we define two fundamental filtered complexes $(E_{conv},P)$ and $(C_{conv},P)$ for the log scheme obtained by a smooth scheme with a relative simple normal crossing divisor over a scheme of characteristic $p&gt;0$. Using $(C_{conv},P)$, we prove the $p$-adic purity. As a corollary of it, we prove that $(E_{conv},P)$ and $(C_{conv},P)$ are canonically isomorphic. These filtered complexes produce the weight spectral sequence of the log convergent cohomology sheaf of the log scheme. We also give the comparison theorem between the projections of $(E_{conv},P)$ and $(C_{conv},P)$ to the derived category of bounded below filtered complexes of sheaves of modules in the Zariski topos of the log scheme and the weight-filtered isozariskian filtered complex $(E_{zar},P)_{Q}$ of the log scheme defined in our previous book.</description>

Abstract: We prove a crepant transformation correspondence in genus zero Gromov-Witten theory for toric stack bundles related by crepant wall-crossings of the toric fibers. Specifically, we construct a symplectic transformation that identifies $I$-functions toric stack bundles suitably analytically continued using Mellin-Barnes integral approach. We compare our symplectic transformation with a Fourier-Mukai isomorphism between the $K$-groups.</description>

      <title>Duality for $p$-adic geometric pro-\'etale cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that $p$-adic geometric pro-\'etale cohomology of smooth partially proper rigid analytic varieties over $p$-adic fields seen in the category of Topological Vector Spaces satisfies a Poincar\'e duality as we have conjectured. This duality descends, via fully-faithfulness results of Colmez-Nizio{\l}, from a Poincar\'e duality for solid quasi-coherent sheaves on the Fargues-Fontaine curve representing this cohomology. The latter duality is proved by passing, via comparison theorems, to analogous sheaves representing syntomic cohomology and then reducing to Poincar\'e duality for ${\mathbf B}^+_{\rm st}$-twisted Hyodo-Kato and filtered $\mathbf{B}^+_{\rm dr}$-cohomologies that, in turn, reduce to Serre duality for smooth Stein varieties -- a classical result.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we propose a conjecture that clarifies the relationship between the number of degree d elliptic curves in complex four-dimensional projective Fano hypersurfaces and their degree d elliptic Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants. The elliptic GW invariants are computed using the elliptic virtual structure constants proposed in our previous works.</description>

Abstract: We construct a description of graded derivations in group algebras. Using this result for arbitrary graduation of the group algebra, we describe all possible structures of DG algebras.

      <title>Emergent Strings in Type IIB Calabi--Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau threefolds, in light of the Emergent String Conjecture. We focus on the so-called type II limits, which, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the physical couplings in the low-energy effective theory, are candidates for emergent string limits. However, due to the absence of Type IIB branes of suitable dimensionality, the emergence of a unique critical string accompanied by a tower of Kaluza--Klein states has so far remained elusive. By considering a broad class of type II$_b$ limits, corresponding to so-called Tyurin degenerations, and studying the asymptotic behaviour of four-dimensional EFT strings in this geometry, we argue that the worldsheet theory of the latter describes a unique critical heterotic string on $T^2\times\mathrm{K3}$ with a gauge bundle whose rank depends on $b$. In addition, we establish the presence of an infinite tower of BPS particles arising from wrapped D3-branes by identifying a suitable set of special Lagrangian 3-cycles in the geometry. The associated BPS invariants are conjectured to be counted by generalisations of modular forms. As a consistency check, we further show that in special cases mirror symmetry identifies the EFT strings with the well-understood emergent string limits in the K\"ahler moduli space of Type IIA compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Emergent String Conjecture for type II limits which do not correspond to Tyurin degenerations, and predict new constraints on the possible geometries of type II degenerations which resemble those arising in the Kulikov classification of degenerations of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical) limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.</description>
