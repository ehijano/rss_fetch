      <title>Comparative Analysis of QNN Architectures for Wind Power Prediction: Feature Maps and Ansatz Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>CutReg: A loss regularizer for enhancing the scalability of QML via adaptive circuit cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question. The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in pursuit of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Q2SAR: A Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning Approach for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Recent solution to the Casimir puzzle awaits its experimental confirmation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plausible resolution of the Casimir puzzle implying that the dissipative Drude model is not applicable in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves is discussed. Calculations show that for the propagating waves, as well for the evanescent waves with transverse magnetic polarization, the Drude model can beused in calculations of the Casimir force by the Lifshitz theory with no contradictions with the measurement data. The lateral component of magnetic field of the magnetic dipole oscillating near a metallic surface is computed for the parameters of experiment in preparation which is aimed to directly check the validity of the Drude model in the area of transverse electric evanescent waves. By comparing with the case of graphene, whose dielectric response is spatially nonlocal and possesses the double pole at zero frequency, it is hypothesized that the success of the dissipationless plasma model in this area is also caused by the presence of a double pole.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Entangling Operations via Josephson Junction Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for implementing two-qubit entangling operations between distant superconducting qubits using a space-time modulated Josephson junction metasurface. By modulating the surface in both space and time, we engineer sidebands with controllable wavevectors that selectively couple target qubits. The metasurface acts as a reconfigurable coupling medium, where the interaction strength is determined by engineered transmission coefficients rather than by exponentially decaying near-field coupling, thus reducing the dependence on physical proximity. We investigated the implementation of two-qubit interactions via iSWAP gates driven resonantly through the metasurface and controlled phase gates via geometric phase accumulation. Simulations show entangling fidelity exceeding 98% maintained over centimeter scale separations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we revisit objectivity conditions for the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model only under the recoilless (Born-Oppenheimer) limit. We clarify the previous results for the objectivity study under what conditions the objectivity is achieved, especially how a trajectory of a central oscillator influences objectivity and why the objectivity is enhanced the phase get closer to $\pi/2$. We show that the finite number of environmental oscillators can have the objectivity only with respect to the associated time scales defined by frequency relation between a central oscillator and environmental oscillators. We study possible frequency relations for the objectivity and the associated time scales.</description>

      <title>Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry configuration designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could mediate entanglement between quantum systems. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the validity of the quantum equivalence principle, this approach may provide insights not only into the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime itself exhibits quantum properties. However, our analysis reveals that, within realistic experimental parameters, the expected effects are too small to be detected. We discuss possible interpretations of this undetectability, and its implications for tests of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The logical structure of contextuality and nonclassicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is known as the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. It is not clear whether contextuality fully reveals the nonclassical aspects of quantum mechanics. To answer this question, we propose a mathematical framework based on logic algebra to compare classical and quantum experiments. With the framework, we precisely characterize the contextuality and nonclassicality, reveal that the former is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the latter, and present a type of quantum experiments which exhibit nonclassicality without contextuality. We also point out that the property of quantum systems is captured by the projector generators. Therefore, it is possible to witness quantum contextuality with simplified measurement configurations. For example, we show that 12 projectors witness the Kochen-Specker contextuality, and 3 measurements are sufficient to witness the quantum contextuality, as compared to the 4 presented in the compatibility graph approach.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Battery Capacity in Tripartite Quantum Systems by Local Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of local von Neumann measurements on quantum battery capacity is investigated in tripartite quantum systems. Two measurement-based protocols are proposed and the concept of optimal local projective operators is introduced. Specifically, explicit analytical expressions are derived for the protocols when applied to general three-qubit X-states. Furthermore, the negative effects of white noise and dephasing noise on quantum battery capacity are analyzed, proving that optimal local projective operators can improve the robustness of subsystem and total system capacity against both noise types for the general tripartite X-state. The performance of different schemes in capacity enhancement are numerically validated through detailed examples and it is found that these optimized operators can effectively enhance both subsystem and total system battery capacity. The results indicate that the local von Neumann measurement is a powerful tool to enhance the battery capacity in multipartite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Notes on detection and measurement of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is one of the most basic characteristics of quantum mechanics. Here we give some methods to detect and measure quantum coherence. Firstly, we propose a coherence criterion without full quantum state tomography based on partial transposition. Moreover, we present a coherent nonlinear detection strategy from witnesses, in which we find that for some coherent states, normal witness detection fails but our nonlinear detection succeeds. In addition, we prove that when the nonlinear detection on the two copies of the coherent state fails, the nonlinear detection on the three copies may be successful. Finally, due to the difficulty in calculating robustness of coherence for general states, we introduce a lower bound for coherent robustness based on the witness operator, and after comparing our lower bound with the currently known lower bound, one show that our lower bound is better. Coherence is believed to play a crucial role in quantum information tasks, making the detection and quantization of coherence particularly significant. Therefore, these results help to open up new avenues for advancement in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic Dissipation as a Mechanism for Steady-State Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation is traditionally regarded as a disruptive factor in quantum systems because it often leads to decoherence and delocalization. However, recent insights into engineered dissipation reveal that it can be tuned to facilitate various quantum effects, from state stabilization to phase transitions. In this work, we identify aperiodic dissipation as a mechanism for inducing steady-state localization, independent of disorder or a quasiperiodic potential in the Hamiltonian. This localization arises from long-range phase correlations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter, which enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state. By systematically comparing two classes of aperiodic dissipation (defined as commensurate and incommensurate cases), we find that incommensurate modulation plays the most efficient role in stabilizing a localized steady-state. Our analysis, based on coherence measures, purity, and participation ratio, reveals a direct link between eigenstate coherence and real-space localization, showing that dissipation can actively shape localization rather than simply causing decoherence. These findings highlight aperiodic dissipation as a viable approach to controlling localization in open quantum systems, potentially enabling new ways to manipulate quantum states and design dissipation-driven phases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Compilation Strategies for QFT Circuits in Neutral-Atom Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum computing (NAQC) offers distinct advantages such as dynamic qubit reconfigurability, long coherence times, and high gate fidelities, making it a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. Despite these strengths, efficiently implementing quantum circuits like the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) remains a significant challenge due to atom movement overheads and connectivity constraints. This paper introduces optimal compilation strategies tailored to QFT circuits and NAQC systems, addressing these challenges for both linear and grid-like architectures. By minimizing atom movements, the proposed methods achieve theoretical lower bounds in atom movements while preserving high circuit fidelity. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art compilers demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods. These methods could serve as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of NAQC compilers.</description>

      <title>A Topologically Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer with Four Dimensional Geometric Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum codes are intrinsically fault-tolerant to local noise, and underlie the theory of topological phases of matter. We explore geometry to enhance the performance of topological quantum codes by rotating the four dimensional self-correcting quantum memory, and present codes targeted to both near-term and utility-scale quantum computers. We identify a full set of logical Clifford operations and with it design a universal fault-tolerant quantum architecture. Our design achieves single-shot error correction, significant reductions in required qubits, and low-depth logical operations. In turn, our proposed architecture relaxes the requirements for achieving fault tolerance and offers an efficient path for realization in several near-term quantum hardware implementations. Our [[96,6,8]] 4D Hadamard lattice code has low weight-6 stabilizers and depth-8 syndrome extraction circuits, a high pseudo-threshold of $\sim 0.01$, and a logical error rate of $\sim 10^{-6}$ per logical qubit per round of error correction at $10^{-3}$ physical error rate under a standard circuit-level noise model. A Clifford-complete logical gate set is presented, including a constructive and efficient method for Clifford gate synthesis.</description>

      <title>Catalytic $z$-rotations in constant $T$-depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $T$-depth of any single-qubit $z$-rotation can be reduced to $3$ if a certain catalyst state is available. To achieve an $\epsilon$-approximation, it suffices to have a catalyst state of size polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$. This implies that $\mathsf{QNC}^0_f/\mathsf{qpoly}$ admits a finite universal gate set consisting of Clifford+$T$. In particular, there are catalytic constant $T$-depth circuits that approximate multi-qubit Toffoli, adder, and quantum Fourier transform arbitrarily well. We also show that the catalyst state can be prepared in time polynomial in $\log (1/\epsilon)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown long-distance entanglement using NV centers, atoms, and quantum dots with single-photon time-bin encoding. We propose a method to entangle remote superconducting qubits via microwave-optical transduction using multi-time-bin states. By adapting conventional entanglement swapping techniques, fidelity improves from 0.75 to $0.98$ in transduction systems, and 0.66 to 0.89 in noisy channels. The protocol mitigates thermal noise without relying on purification and offers a practical path toward scalable, heterogeneous quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Quantum Parameter Estimation Uncertainty Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation aims to simultaneously estimate multiple parameters from observing quantum systems and data processing. The complexity of quantum multiparameter estimation arises primarily from measurement incompatibility and parameter correlations. By manipulating the multidimensional parameter space, we derive an estimation uncertainty relation that captures the impact of measurement incompatibility and parameter correlation on quantum two-parameter estimation. This uncertainty relation is tight for pure states and completely describes the quantum limit of two-parameter estimation precision. We also develop an error ellipse method to intuitively illustrate the impact of the uncertainty relation and apply it to the phase-space complex displacement estimation. Our research shows that multiparameter estimation challenges can be effectively addressed by manipulating the geometry of multidimensional parameter space.</description>

      <title>SYK model based $\beta$ regime dependent two-qubit dynamical wormhole-inspired teleportation protocol simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to provide insights into various aspects of quantum chaos and teleportation by implementing the recently developed Wormhole-Inspired Teleportation Protocol (WITP). We commence by constructing an analog of a traversable wormhole utilizing the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in conjunction with the Thermofield Double (TFD) state framework, implemented within a quantum circuit. Subsequently, we manipulate various parameters, including temperature ($\beta$) and the location of the message qubit, and compare the fidelity result with that of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)-based wormhole-inspired teleportation protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the SYK-based protocol achieves a higher fidelity of states in comparison to the TFIM counterpart. We further analyze the protocol for different values of $\beta$ and the SWAP operator. These findings are attributed to the emergence of random matrix ensembles via random phase theory within the dynamics of the SYK model, which is characterized by pronounced chaotic behavior. A significant outcome of our investigation is initializing the message as a two-qubit Bell state, followed by teleportation across the system. We introduce a Pauli stabilizer-based fidelity measure to diagnose the teleportation characteristics. This yields a considerable enhancement in fidelity relative to the single-qubit variant of the protocol. Finally, we analyze the temporal fluctuation of fidelity for both single-qubit and two-qubit message across the channel, contributing to a deeper understanding of quantum teleportation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning to Maximize Quantum Neural Network Expressivity via Effective Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\"atze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Dynamical decoupling of interacting spins through group factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a well-known open-loop protocol for suppressing unwanted interactions in a quantum system, thereby drastically extending the coherence time of useful quantum states. In the original framework of evolution symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales, using the factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences developed in the context of NMR and further produces novel short and robust sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions, and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Quantum Memory of Full-Bandwidth Squeezed Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum information processing, it is crucial to develop high-efficiency and broadband quantum memory of squeezed light, which enables the storage of full-bandwidth information. Here, we present a quantum memory of squeezed light with up to 24 MHz bandwidth, which is at least 12 times that of previous narrowband resonant memory systems, via a far-off resonant Raman process. We achieve output squeezing of as high as 1.0 dB with fidelity above 92% and a memory efficiency of 80%, corresponding to an end-to-end efficiency of 64.2%, when input squeezing is 1.6 dB. The lowest excess noise of 0.025 shot-noise-unit in the memory system is estimated by the noisy channel model which is benefited from optimizing quantum memory performance with a backward retrieval strategy. Our results represent a breakthrough in high-performance memory for squeezed states within tens of MHz-level bandwidth, which has potential applications in high-speed quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Error-detected coherence metrology of a dual-rail encoded fixed-frequency multimode superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplitude damping is a dominant source of error in high performance quantum processors. A promising approach in quantum error correction is erasure error conversion, where errors are converted into detectable leakage states. Dual-rail encoding has been shown as a candidate for the conversion of amplitude-damping errors; with unique sensitivities to noise and decoherence sources. Here we present a dual-rail encoding within a single fixed-frequency superconducting multimode transmon qubit. The three island, two junction device comprises two transmonlike modes with a detuning of 0.75-1 GHz, in a coaxial circuit QED architecture. We show the logical bit-flip and phase-flip error rates are more than one order of magnitude lower than the physical error rates, and demonstrate stability and repeatability of the architecture through an extended measurement of three such devices. Finally, we discuss how the error-detected subspace can be used for investigations into the fundamentals of noise and decoherence in fixed-frequency transmon qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identify, Transform, Benchmark, Show Quantum Advantage (ITBQ): Evaluating use cases for quantum computers. We introduce a four-step framework for assessing quantum computing applications -- from identifying relevant industry problems to demonstrating quantum advantage -- addressing steps often overlooked in the literature, such as rigorous benchmarking against classical solutions and the challenge of translating real-world tasks onto quantum hardware. Applying this framework to cases like NMR, multireference chemistry, and radicals reveals both significant opportunities and key barriers on the path to practical advantage. Our results highlight the need for transparent, structured criteria to focus research, guide investment, and accelerate meaningful quantum progress.</description>

      <title>Excitation Amplitude Sampling for Low Variance Electronic Structure on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.</description>

      <title>Satellite Signal Detection via Rydberg-Atom Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg-atom receivers aim for ultra-high sensitivity to microwave fields through various techniques, but receiving satellite signals has remained a significant challenge, due to the difficulty of capturing weak microwaves over long distances. In this work, we introduce a high-gain antenna to focus satellite signals, and then apply into an atomic cell via a microwave cavity. Using microwave-enhanced coupling, the minimum detectable power of incident microwave is down to -128 dBm, and the corresponding sensitivity is estimated as 21 nV/cm/Hz1/2 at frequency of 3.80 GHz. Furthermore, beacon signal from geostationary satellites is captured with Rydberg sensors for the first time, without the need for a low-noise amplifier. And C-band modulated signals are read out with a signal-to-noise ratio of 8 dB. Our results mark a significant breakthrough in facilitating satellite communications using Rydberg-atom receivers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive random compiler for Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized compilation protocols have recently attracted attention as alternatives to traditional deterministic Trotter-Suzuki methods, potentially reducing circuit depth and resource overhead. These protocols determine gate application probabilities based on the strengths of Hamiltonian terms, as measured by the trace norm. However, relying solely on the trace norm to define sampling distributions may not be optimal, especially for continuous-variable and hybrid-variable systems involving unbounded operators, where quantifying Hamiltonian strengths is challenging. In this work, we propose an adaptive randomized compilation algorithm that dynamically updates sampling weights via low-order moment measurements of Hamiltonian terms, assigning higher probabilities to terms with greater uncertainty. This approach improves accuracy without significantly increasing gate counts and extends randomized compilation to continuous-variable and hybrid-variable systems by addressing the difficulties in characterizing the strengths of unbounded Hamiltonian terms. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universality of quantum theory has been questioned ever since it was proposed. Key to this long-unsolved question is to test whether a given physical system has non-classical features. Here we connect recently proposed witnesses of non-classicality, based on information-theoretic ideas, with the theory of temporal entanglement. We provide a protocol to witness the non-classicality of a system by probing it with a qubit: we show that, assuming a general conservation law, violating temporal Bell inequalities on the qubit probe implies the non-classicality of the system under investigation. We also perform proof-of-principle experimental emulations of the proposed witness of non-classicality, using a three qubit Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum computer. Our result is robust, as it relies on minimal assumptions, and remarkably it can be applied in a broad range of contexts, from quantum biology to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Can the gate time of Rydberg two-qubit gate be shorten by increasing the strength of Rydberg interaction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we discuss the relationship between the gate time of Rydberg two-qubit gate and the Rydberg interaction strength. Different from the two-qbuit gates that directly depend on the interactions between the spins (or pseudo spins), the ones in atomic arrays are realized by driving the atoms to the Rydberg states. As a consequence, competition happens between shortening the gate time and decreasing the excitation probability of Rydberg states. For the case of Rydberg blockade, it is found that the gate time is irrelevant of the Rydberg interaction strength. In contrast, for the case of weak Rydberg interactions, the interactions will help to accelerate the two-qubit gates. This implies that the scheme of weak Rydberg interactions will be faster than the Rydberg blockade one to realize the two-qbuit gates under the same Rabi frequencies of Rydberg excitation. Through using the geometric control under the region of weak Rydberg interaction, fast and robust two-qubit gates can be achieved in atomic arrays, of which detailed discussion can be referred to the manuscript \textsl{arXiv:2412. 19193 (2024)}.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Multi-Qubit Correlated Noise Errors Enhances Surface Code Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface codes are promising for practical quantum error correction due to their high threshold and experimental feasibility. However, their performance under realistic noise conditions, particularly those involving correlated errors, requires further investigation. In this study, we investigate the impact of correlated errors on the error threshold. In particular, we focus on several distinct types of correlated errors that could potentially arise from next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) coupling in quantum systems. We present the analytical threshold of the surface code under these types of correlated noise, and find that errors correlated along straight lines possess a type of crucial symmetry, resulting in higher thresholds compared to other types of correlated errors. This deepens our insight into the threshold of surface code and hence facilitates a more robust design of quantum circuits with a higher noise threshold.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>Observation of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universal scaling in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: A long-standing open problem in quantum complexity theory is whether ${\sf QMA}$, the quantum analogue of ${\sf NP}$, is equal to ${\sf QMA}_1$, its one-sided error variant. We show that ${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}^{\infty}= {\sf QMA}_1^{\infty}$, where ${\sf QMA}_1^\infty$ is like ${\sf QMA}_1$, but the verifier has an infinite register, as part of their witness system, in which they can efficiently perform a shift (increment) operation. We call this register an ``infinite counter'', and compare it to a program counter in a Las Vegas algorithm. The result ${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}^\infty$ means such an infinite register does not increase the power of ${\sf QMA}$, but does imply perfect completeness.
  By truncating our construction to finite dimensions, we get a ${\sf QMA}$-amplifier that only amplifies completeness, not soundness, but does so in significantly less time than previous ${\sf QMA}$ amplifiers. Our new construction achieves completeness $1-2^{-q}$ using $O(1)$ calls to each of the original verifier and its inverse, and $O(\log q)$ other gates, proving that ${\sf QMA}$ has completeness doubly exponentially close to 1, i.e. ${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}(1-2^{-2^r},2^{-r})$ for any polynomial $r$.</description>

      <title>Chiral Symmetries and Multiparticle Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosons and fermions are defined by their exchange properties and the underlying symmetries determine the structure of the corresponding state spaces. For two particles there are two possible exchange symmetries, resulting in symmetric or antisymmetric behaviour, but when exploring multiparticle systems also quantum states with chiral symmetries appear. In this work we demonstrate that chiral symmetries lead to extremal forms of quantum entanglement. More precisely, we show that subspaces with this symmetry are highly entangled with respect to the geometric measure of entanglement, leading to observables which can be useful for entanglement characterization. Along the way, we develop a simple method to solve the problem of genuine multiparticle entanglement for unitarily invariant three-particle states and use it to identify genuine multipartite entangled states whose partial transposes with respect to all bipartitions are positive. Finally, we consider generalizations with less symmetry and discuss potential applications.</description>

      <title>Fast, continuous and coherent atom replacement in a neutral atom qubit array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. An obstacle to implementing deep quantum circuits is managing atom loss, which constitutes a significant fraction of all errors. Current approaches are either not capable of replacing lost atoms in the middle of a circuit -- and therefore restricted to fixed, short circuit depths -- or require more than an order of magnitude longer time than gate and measurement operations to do so. In this work, we demonstrate fast, continuous atom replacement leveraging the metastable $^{171}$Yb qubit. A continuously loaded reservoir near the computation zone enables on-demand atom extraction with tweezers up to 500 times per second. New qubit arrays can be prepared 30 times per second when including single-atom preparation, non-destructive imaging and initialization. Importantly, existing qubits are completely undisturbed by the reloading process, owing to the extreme isolation of the metastable qubit from cooling and imaging light. This work establishes a complete foundation for implementing fast quantum circuits with unlimited depth, removing a final roadblock for fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction Exploiting Degeneracy to Approach the Hashing Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for realizing scalable quantum computation. Among various approaches, low-density parity-check codes over higher-order Galois fields have shown promising performance due to their structured sparsity and compatibility with iterative decoding algorithms whose computational complexity scales linearly with the number of physical qubits. In this work, we demonstrate that explicitly exploiting the degeneracy of quantum errors can significantly enhance the decoding performance. Simulation results over the depolarizing channel indicate that the proposed method, at a coding rate of 1/3, achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-4}$ at a physical error rate of 9.45% for a code with 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical qubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound. These findings highlight the critical role of degeneracy in closing the gap to the fundamental limits of quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Mitigating sloppiness in joint estimation of successive squeezing parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two successive squeezing operations with the same phase are applied to a field mode, reliably estimating the amplitude of each is impossible because the output state depends solely on their sum. In this case, the quantum statistical model becomes sloppy, and the quantum Fisher information matrix turns singular. However, estimation of both parameters becomes feasible if the quantum state is subjected to an appropriate scrambling operation between the two squeezing operations. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of a phase-shift scrambling transformation, optimized to reduce sloppiness and maximize the overall estimation precision. We also compare the optimized precision bounds of joint estimation with those of stepwise estimation methods, finding that joint estimation retains an advantage despite the quantum noise induced by the residual parameter incompatibility. Finally, we analyze the precision achievable by general-dyne detection and find that it may approach the optimal precision in some regimes.</description>

      <title>Randomised composite linear-combination-of-unitaries: its role in quantum simulation and observable estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomisation is widely used in quantum algorithms to reduce the number of quantum gates and ancillary qubits required. A range of randomised algorithms, including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an unphysical form $U \rho V^\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore, randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \rho V^\dagger$ and its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction branches demand a definition!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under unitary evolution, a typical macroscopic quantum system is thought to develop wavefunction branches: a time-dependent decomposition into orthogonal components that (1) form a tree structure forward in time, (2) are approximate eigenstates of quasiclassical macroscopic observables, and (3) exhibit effective collapse of feasibly measurable observables. If they could be defined precisely, wavefunction branches would extend the theory of decoherence beyond the system-environment paradigm and could supplant anthropocentric measurement in the quantum axioms. Furthermore, when such branches have bounded entanglement and can be effectively identified numerically, sampling them would allow asymptotically efficient classical simulation of quantum systems. I consider a promising recent approach to formalizing branches on the lattice by Taylor &amp; McCulloch [Quantum 9, 1670 (2025), arXiv:2308.04494], and compare it to prior work from Weingarten [Found. Phys. 52, 45 (2022), arXiv:2105.04545]. Both proposals are based on quantum complexity and argue that, once created, branches persist for long times due to the generic linear growth of state complexity. Taylor &amp; McCulloch characterize branches by a large difference in the unitary complexity necessary to interfere vs. distinguish them. Weingarten takes branches as the components of the decomposition that minimizes a weighted sum of expected squared complexity and the Shannon entropy of squared norms. I discuss strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, and identify tractable open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvalue estimation is a central problem for demonstrating quantum advantage, yet its implementation on digital quantum computers remains limited by circuit depth and operational overhead. We present an analog quantum phase estimation (aQPE) protocol that extracts the eigenenergies of a target Hamiltonian via continuous time evolution and single-mode cavity measurement. By encoding eigenvalue information as conditional cavity phase-space rotations, the scheme avoids deep quantum circuits and entangling gates, while enabling readout through established cavity tomography techniques. We further illustrate the feasibility of this approach by engineering a Hamiltonian that implements aQPE of the XY model, whose ground-state energy problem is QMA-complete, within a physical architecture compatible with existing circuit quantum electrodynamics technology. Our results provide a resource-efficient and scalable framework for implementing quantum phase estimation in near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of biological systems is an exciting avenue for applying advanced approaches to solving corresponding computational tasks. A specific class of problems that arises in the resolution of biological challenges is optimization. In this work, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study that applies a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to simulate a viral response. We formulate an Ising-type model to describe the patterns of gene activity in host responses. Reducing the problem to the Ising form allows the use of available quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools. We demonstrate the application of a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to this problem. Our study paves the way for exploring the full potential of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools in biological applications.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $\theta$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Semi-Classical Signatures of Dissipative Chaos in the Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body systems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact diagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct connection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point attractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties of the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as quantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics of the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with regular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising from chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries constrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and enforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of the phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize phase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation ratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's support. We find that the entropy scales as $S \propto \ln N^D$, consistently capturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical framework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully reproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as spectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that dissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much like in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and symmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and phase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying ergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of thermalization in a quantum field-theoretic model mimicking the production of jets in QCD -- the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. Specifically, we compute the expectation values of local operators as functions of time and compare them to their thermal counterparts, quantify the overlap between the evolving density matrix and the thermal one, and compare the dynamics of the energy-momentum tensor to predictions from relativistic hydrodynamics. Through these studies, we find that the system approaches thermalization at late times and elucidate the mechanisms by which quantum entanglement drives thermalization in closed field-theoretic systems. Our results show how thermodynamic behavior emerges in real time from unitary quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of an unshielded dielectric $\unicode{x2013}$ here, a bare optical fiber $\unicode{x2013}$ on a $^{40}$Ca${^+}$ ion held several hundred $\mu$m away in a cryogenic surface electrode trap. We observe distance-dependent stray electric fields of up to a few kV/m due to the dielectric, which drift on average less than 10% per month and can be fully compensated with reasonable voltages on the trap electrodes. We observe ion motional heating rates attributable to the dielectric of $\approx$30 quanta per second at an ion-fiber distance of 215(4) $\mu$m and $\approx$1.5 MHz motional frequency. These results demonstrate the viability of using unshielded, trap-integrated dielectric objects such as miniature optical cavities or other optical elements in cryogenic surface electrode ion traps.</description>

      <title>Nano-resolved sensing of 3D electromagnetic fields via single emitters' extreme variation of enhanced spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling quantum light-matter interactions at scales smaller than the diffraction limit at the single quantum emitter level is a critical challenge to the goal of advancing quantum technologies. We introduce a novel material platform that enables precise engineering of spontaneous emission changes in molecular single emitters through 3D nanofields. This platform is based on a 3D hollow plasmonic nanomaterial arranged in a square lattice, uniformly scalable to the centimeter scale while maintaining unit cell geometry. This coupled system leads to billions of Purcell-enhanced single emitters integrated into a nanodevice. Using far-field single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, we investigate emission modifications at the single-emitter level, enabling molecular position sensing with resolution surpassing the diffraction limit. By combining the nanolocalization with time correlation single photon counting, we probe molecule per molecule enhanced quantum light-matter interactions. This 3D plasmonic geometry significantly enhances light-matter interactions, revealing a broad range of lifetimes -- from nanoseconds to picoseconds -- significantly increasing the local density of states in a manner that depends on both molecular position and dipole orientation, offering extreme position sensitivity within the 3D electromagnetic landscape. By leveraging these plasmonic nanostructures and our method for measuring single-molecule Purcell-enhanced nano-resolved maps, we enable fine-tuned control of light-matter interactions. This approach enables the on-demand control of fast single-photon sources at room temperature, providing a powerful tool for molecular sensing and quantum applications at the single-emitter level.</description>

      <title>Classical analog of the T. D. Lee model for renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While divergence and renormalization of physical quantities are frequently encountered in quantum field theory (QFT), they are not necessarily quantum-specific characteristics. We show in this paper that there exists a classical counterpart of the Lee model which is the model of coupled harmonic oscillators (CHO). It is demonstrated that the frequency divergence in this classical model precisely replicates the phenomenon of mass divergence in the Lee model, as does the corresponding renormalization procedure. Considering the arbitrariness in renormalization schemes, we establish necessary conditions that a general renormalization must satisfy for the model of two coupled oscillators which corresponds to the single-mode Lee model. Furthermore, we analyze the classical analog of $N\text{-}\theta$ scattering process and show that the dependence of scattering strength on the cutoff mode mirrors that of the quantum case. These findings challenge the quantum-centric view of mass renormalization in the Lee model and offer new insights into the classical-quantum correspondence in renormalization theories.</description>

      <title>Anomalous energy correlations and spectral form factor in the nonergodic phase of the $\beta$-ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\beta$-ensemble is a prototypical model of a single particle system on a one-dimensional disordered lattice with inhomogeneous nearest neighbor hopping. Corresponding nonergodic phase has an anomalous critical energy scale, $E_c$: correlations are present above and absent below $E_c$ as reflected in the number variance. We study the dynamical properties of the $\beta$-ensemble where the critical energy controls the characteristic timescales. In particular, the spectral form factor equilibrates at a relaxation time, $t_\mathrm{R} \equiv E_c^{-1}$, which is parametrically smaller than the Heisenberg time, $t_\mathrm{H}$, given by the inverse of the mean level spacing. Incidentally, the dimensionless relaxation time, $\tau_\mathrm{R} \equiv t_\mathrm{R}/t_\mathrm{H} \ll 1$ is equal to the Dyson index, $\beta$. We show that the energy correlations are absent within a temporal window $t_\mathrm{R} &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{H}$, which we term as the correlation void. This is in contrast to the mechanism of equilibration in a typical many-body system. We analytically explain the qualitative behavior of the number variance and the spectral form factor of the $\beta$-ensemble by a spatially local mapping to the Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent modulation in InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions by scanning gate microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InSb nanoflags represent an interesting platform for quantum transport and have recently been exploited in the study of hybrid planar Josephson junctions. Due to the uncovered semiconductor surface, they are also good candidates for surface probe techniques. Here, we report the first Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) experiments on Nb-contacted InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions. In the normal state, sizable conductance modulation via the charged tip of the SGM is recorded. In the superconducting state, we report the first application of Scanning Gate Microscopy to superconducting weak links, demonstrating the possibility of manipulating the supercurrent flow across a semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure at a local level. The experimental findings are consistent with theoretical predictions and establish a new way of investigating the behavior of superconducting weak links, towards the local imaging of supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Entanglement through high-energy scattering in noncommutative quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cosmic structure from Planckian discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard inflationary paradigm the inhomogeneities observed in the CMB arise from quantum fluctuations of an initially homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state. This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales. Here, we extend the aforementioned proposal to the most realistic case of a quasi-de Sitter expansion; in particular, we compute the scalar perturbation spectrum as a function of the slow-roll parameters, systematically encoded through the Hubble flow functions.</description>

      <title>An efficient construction of Raz's two-source randomness extractor with improved parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness extractors are algorithms that distill weak random sources into near-perfect random numbers. Two-source extractors enable this distillation process by combining two independent weak random sources. Raz's extractor (STOC '05) was the first to achieve this in a setting where one source has linear min-entropy (i.e., proportional to its length), while the other has only logarithmic min-entropy in its length. However, Raz's original construction is impractical due to a polynomial computation time of at least degree 4. Our work solves this problem by presenting an improved version of Raz's extractor with quasi-linear computation time, as well as a new analytic theorem with reduced entropy requirements. We provide comprehensive analytical and numerical comparisons of our construction with others in the literature, and we derive strong and quantum-proof versions of our efficient Raz extractor. Additionally, we offer an easy-to-use, open-source code implementation of the extractor and a numerical parameter calculation module.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Genuine Three-copy Collective Measurements for Optimal Information Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical phenomena tied to entangled states are the focus of foundational studies and powerful resources in many applications. By contrast, the counterparts in quantum measurements are still poorly understood. Notably, genuine multipartite nonclassicality is barely discussed, let alone its experimental realization. Here we experimentally demonstrate the power of genuine tripartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements based on a simple estimation problem. To this end we realize an optimal genuine three-copy collective measurement via a nine-step two-dimensional photonic quantum walk with 30 elaborately designed coin operators. Then we realize an optimal estimation protocol and achieve an unprecedented high estimation fidelity, which can beat all strategies based on restricted collective measurements by more than 11 standard deviations. These results clearly demonstrate that genuine collective measurements can extract more information than local measurements and restricted collective measurements. Our work opens the door for exploring genuine multipartite nonclassical measurements and their power in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demonstrations of quantum advantage for certain sampling problems have generated considerable excitement for quantum computing and have further spurred the development of circuit-model quantum computers, which represent quantum programs as a sequence of quantum gates acting on a finite number of qubits. Amongst this excitement, analog quantum computation has become less prominent, with the expectation that circuit-model quantum computers will eventually be sufficient for emulating analog quantum computation and thus rendering analog quantum computation obsolete. In this work we explore the basic requirements for emulating a specific analog quantum computation in the circuit model: the preparation of a biased superposition of degenerate ground states of an Ising Hamiltonian using an adiabatic evolution. We show that the overhead of emulation is substantial even for this simple problem. This supports using analog quantum computation for solving time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics in the short term and midterm, assuming analog errors can be made low enough and coherence times long enough to solve problems of practical interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is fundamentally impeded by the combined effect of optical diffraction and photon shot noise under extreme star-planet contrast. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet signatures by optically suppressing light from the host star while preserving light from the exoplanet. However, it is unclear whether direct imaging coronagraphs constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant to exoplanet discovery. In this work, we first review the quantum information limits of exoplanet detection and localization characterized by (1) the quantum Chernoff exponent for symmetric hypothesis testing, (2) the quantum relative entropy for asymmetric hypothesis testing, and (3) the quantum Fisher information matrix for multiparameter estimation. We demonstrate that coronagraphs designed to completely suppress light in the fundamental mode of the telescope - while perfectly transmitting higher-order orthogonal modes - indeed achieve these limits in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Furthermore, we formulate coronagraphs as quantum channels, thus generalizing the classical framework of coronography to the quantum setting. Using this framework, we compare the information-theoretic performance of leading coronagraph designs against the quantum limits. Our analysis indicates that quantum-optimal coronagraphs offer enhanced information efficiency in the sub-diffraction regime compared to leading coronagraph designs and may significantly expand the domain of accessible exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Why is the universe not frozen by the quantum Zeno effect?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a discrete model that simulates the ubiquitous competition between the free internal evolution of a two-level system and the decoherence induced by the interaction with its surrounding environment. It is aimed at being as universal as possible, so that no specific Hamiltonian is assumed. This leads to an analytic criterion, depending on the level of short time decoherence, allowing to determine whether the system will freeze due to the Zeno effect. We check this criterion on several classes of functions which correspond to different physical situations. In the most generic case, the free evolution wins over decoherence, thereby explaining why the universe is indeed not frozen. We finally make a quantitative comparison with the continuous model of Presilla, Onofrio and Tambini, based on a Lindblad's master equation, a find good agreement at least in the low coupling regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing computational scaling for simulating non-Markovian dissipative dynamics using artificial neural networks is both a major focus and formidable challenge in open quantum systems. To enable neural quantum states (NQSs), we encode environmental memory in dissipatons (quasiparticles with characteristic lifetimes), yielding the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation (DQME). The resulting NQS-DQME framework achieves compact representation of many-body correlations and non-Markovian memory. Benchmarking against numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion confirms NQS-DQME maintains comparable accuracy while enhancing scalability and interpretability. This methodology opens new paths to explore non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in previously intractable systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting qubits at the utility scale: the potential and limitations of modularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) is receiving increasing attention within the quantum computing community. Like conventional digital computers, FTQCs, which utilize error correction and millions of physical qubits, have the potential to address some of humanity's grand challenges. However, accurate estimates of the tangible scale of future FTQCs, based on transparent assumptions, are uncommon. How many physical qubits are necessary to solve a practical problem intractable for classical hardware? What costs arise from distributing quantum computation across multiple machines? This paper presents an architectural model of a potential FTQC based on superconducting qubits, divided into discrete modules and interconnected via coherent links. We employ a resource estimation framework and software tool to assess the physical resources required to execute specific quantum algorithms compiled into their graph-state form and arranged onto a modular superconducting hardware architecture. Our tool can predict the size, power consumption, and execution time of these algorithms as they approach the utility scale based on explicit assumptions about the physical layout, thermal load, and modular connectivity of the system. Using this tool, we assess the total resources in the proposed modular architecture and highlight the impact of trade-offs, intermodule connectivity, latency, and space-time resource requirements.</description>

Abstract: Noise resilience of quantum information processing is a crucial precondition to reach the fault-tolerance threshold. While resilience to many types of noise can be achieved through suitable control schemes, resilience to amplitude noise seems to be elusive within the common harmonic approximation for the bus mode of trapped ions. We show that weak an-harmonicities admit control schemes that achieve amplitude noise-resilience consistent with state-of-the-art experimental requirements, and that the required an-harmonicities can be achieved with current standards of micro-structured traps or even the intrinsically an-harmonic Coulomb interaction. This approach applies broadly to any platform that employs a bosonic bus as a qubit coupler.</description>

Abstract: In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen argued that quantum mechanics is incomplete based on the assumption that local actions cannot influence elements of reality at a distant location (local realism). In this work, using a recently defined quantum reality quantifier, we show that Alice's local quantum operations can be correlated with the erasure of the reality of observables in Bob's causally disconnected laboratory. To this end, we implement a modified optical quantum eraser experiment, ensuring that Alice's and Bob's measurements remain causally disconnected. Using an entangled pair of photons and quantum state tomography, we experimentally verify that, even with the total absence of any form of classical communication, the choice of quantum operation applied by Alice on her photon is correlated with the erasure of a spatial element of reality of Bob's photon. Our results reveal that Bob's photon can entangle two extra non-interacting degrees of freedom, thus confirming that Bob's photon path is not an element of physical reality.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence between Classical Position Verification and Certified Randomness</title>

Abstract: Gate-based quantum computers hold enormous potential to accelerate classically intractable computational tasks. Random circuit sampling (RCS) is the only known task that has been able to be experimentally demonstrated using current-day NISQ devices. However, for a long time, it remained challenging to demonstrate the quantum utility of RCS on practical problems. Recently, leveraging RCS, an interactive protocol generating certified randomness was demonstrated using a trapped ion quantum computer, advancing the practical utility of near-term gate-based quantum computers. In this work, we establish a strong connection between certified randomness and another quantum computation classical communication primitive, classically verifiable position verification (CVPV), which circumvents the practical challenges that may arise from long-distance quantum communications. We provide a new generic compiler that can convert any single-round proof of quantumness based certified randomness protocol into a secure classical communication-based position verification scheme. Later, we extend our compiler to different types of multi-round protocols. Notably, our compiler can be applied to any multi-round certified randomness protocol that can be analyzed using the entropy accumulation theorem, making its applicability very general. Moreover, we show that CVPV is equivalent to a relaxed variant of certified randomness that we define. We instantiate each of our compilers using existing certified randomness protocols. In particular, building on the work of Aaronson and Hung (STOC '23), we give a NISQ-friendly instantiation based on RCS, which was experimentally demonstrated by Liu et al.. Hence, we show that CVPV is another application within reach of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Optimizing mechanical entanglement using squeezing and parametric amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15345v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme of an optomechanical system that optimizes entanglement in nanomechanical resonators through quantum state transfer of intracavity squeezing and squeezed reservoir field sources assisted by radiation pressure. The system is driven by red-detuned laser fields, which enable simultaneous cooling of the mechanical resonators and facilitate the quantum state transfer in a weak coupling and good cavity limit. Specifically, the mechanical entanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity within the bipartite Gaussian states of the two mechanical modes. The results show that several key parameters, including the parametric phase and nonlinear gain of the non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier, the strength of the squeezing reservoir, optomechanical cooperativity, thermal excitation of phonons, and the temperature of mechanical baths, strongly influence the degree of mechanical entanglement. Hence, the findings indicate that careful tuning of the parameters can enable control over the enhancement of entanglement robustness, suggesting that this optomechanical scheme provides a viable pathway for applications in quantum sensing and information processing</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal transmission in hybrid atomic ensemble-optomechanical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate perfect optical nonreciprocal transmission in a hybrid optomechanical system that incorporates an atomic ensemble. By introducing complex coupling strengths between the atomic ensemble and a mechanical oscillator, nonreciprocity is induced through interference between distinct optical pathways. The nonreciprocal transmission is governed by the real and imaginary components of the coupling constants, along with the relative phase differences between the optomechanical couplings. Our analysis reveals that, with precise tuning of system parameters, such as coupling strengths, detuning, and phase differences, perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. We derive the conditions necessary for optimal nonreciprocal transmission and demonstrate its dependence on the complex nature of the coupling. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of nonreciprocal optical devices, including isolators and circulators, with potential applications in quantum communication, signal processing, and photonics.</description>

      <title>Universal solution to the Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) is an important perturbative method in quantum mechanics used to simplify Hamiltonians by decoupling low- and high-energy subspaces. Existing methods for implementing the SWT often lack general applicability to arbitrary perturbative systems or fail to provide a closed-form solution for the SWT generator. In this article, we present a systematic and unified framework for the SWT that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for the SWT generator that is universally applicable to any system that satisfies the conditions required for perturbative treatment. Furthermore, we extend this solution to time-dependent systems with periodic perturbations, covering all frequency regimes. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by applying it to analyze the dispersive shift of an anharmonic resonator coupled to a two-level system with time-dependent coupling.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

Abstract: We present qlbm, a Python software package designed to facilitate the development, simulation, and analysis of Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QBMs). qlbm is a modular framework that introduces a quantum component abstraction hierarchy tailored to the implementation of novel QBMs. The framework interfaces with state-of-the-art quantum software infrastructure to enable efficient simulation and validation pipelines, and leverages novel execution and pre-processing techniques that significantly reduce the computational resources required to develop quantum circuits. We demonstrate the versatility of the software by showcasing multiple QBMs in 2D and 3D with complex boundary conditions, integrated within automated benchmarking utilities. Accompanying the source code are extensive test suites, thorough online documentation resources, analysis tools, visualization methods, and demos that aim to increase the accessibility of QBMs while encouraging reproducibility and collaboration.

      <title>Characterizing maximally many-body entangled fermionic states by using $M$-body density matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermionic Hamiltonians play a critical role in quantum chemistry, one of the most promising use cases for near-term quantum computers. However, since encoding nonlocal fermionic statistics using conventional qubits results in significant computational overhead, fermionic quantum hardware, such as fermion atom arrays, were proposed as a more efficient platform. In this context, we here study the many-body entanglement structure of fermionic $N$-particle states by concentrating on $M$-body reduced density matrices (DMs) across various bipartitions in Fock space. The von Neumann entropy of the reduced DM is a basis independent entanglement measure which generalizes the traditional quantum chemistry concept of the one-particle DM entanglement, which characterizes how a single fermion is entangled with the rest. We carefully examine upper bounds on the $M$-body entanglement, which are analogous to the volume law of conventional entanglement measures. To this end we establish a connection between $M$-body reduced DM and the mathematical structure of hypergraphs. Specifically, we show that a special class of hypergraphs, known as $t$-designs, corresponds to maximally entangled fermionic states. Finally, we explore fermionic many-body entanglement in random states. We semianalytically demonstrate that the distribution of reduced DMs associated with random fermionic states corresponds to the trace-fixed Wishart-Laguerre random matrix ensemble. In the limit of large single-particle dimension $D$ and a non-zero filling fraction, random states asymptotically become absolutely maximally entangled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an application of the affine covariant integral quantization (ACIQ) (Adv.Oper.Theory, 5, 901, 2020, Adv.Oper.Theory, 7.1, 2020) to quantum mechanics on the punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), which comprises translations, rotations, and dilations of the plane. Due to the topology of the punctured plane, our quantization procedure gives rise to an affine vector potential. This potential can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge field produced by an infinite solenoid. This observation supports a reinterpretation of the AB effect: it emerges from the topological constraint imposed by the impenetrable coil rather than from an externally applied classical gauge field. In addition to this gauge structure, ACIQ also generates a repulsive, centrifugal-like scalar potential, a feature already encountered when applying ACIQ to motion on the half-line, whose phase space is the open half-plane. These results provide a new perspective on the AB effect, highlighting the central roles of topology and symmetry in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: While quantum key distribution (QKD) based on two-dimensional (qubit) encoding is a mature, field-tested technology, its performance is lacking for many cryptographic applications. High-dimensional encoding for QKD enables increased achievable key rates and robustness as compared to the standard qubit-based systems. However, experimental implementations of such systems are more complicated, expensive, and require careful security analysis as they are less common. In this work we present a proof of principle high-dimensional time-phase BB84 QKD experiment using only one single-photon detector per measurement basis. We employ the temporal Talbot effect to detect QKD symbols in the control basis, and show experimentally-obtained simplistic key rates for the two-dimensional and four-dimensional case, including in an urban fiber network. We present a comparison of a simplistic secret key rate obtained from a standard security proof with the one derived from a recently devised proof using a tunable beam splitter to display security issues stemming from asymmetric detection efficiencies in the two bases. Our results contribute to the discussion of the benefits of high-dimensional encoding and highlight the impact of security analysis on the achievable QKD performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edge list model is arguably the simplest input model for graphs, where the graph is specified by a list of its edges. In this model, we study the quantum query complexity of three variants of the triangle finding problem. The first asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target edge and raises general questions about the hiding of a problem's input among irrelevant data. The second asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target vertex and raises general questions about the shuffling of a problem's input. The third asks whether there exists a triangle; this problem bridges the $3$-distinctness and $3$-sum problems, which have been extensively studied by both cryptographers and complexity theorists. We provide tight or nearly tight results for these problems as well as some first answers to the general questions they raise.
  Furthermore, given a graph with low maximum degree, such as a random sparse graph, we prove that the quantum query complexity of finding a length-$k$ cycle in its length-$m$ edge list is $m^{3/4-1/(2^{k+2}-4)\pm o(1)}$. We prove the lower bound in Zhandry's recording query framework [CRYPTO '19] as generalized by Hamoudi and Magniez [ToCT '23], and the upper bound by adapting Belovs's learning graph algorithm for $k$-distinctness [FOCS '12].</description>

      <title>Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>Training Hybrid Deep Quantum Neural Network for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuits embed data in a Hilbert space whose dimensionality grows exponentially with the number of qubits, allowing even shallow parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) to represent highly-correlated probability distributions that are costly for classical networks to capture. Reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which must reason over long-horizon, continuous-control tasks, stand to benefit from this expressive quantum feature space, but only if the quantum layers can be trained jointly with the surrounding deep-neural components. Current gradient-estimation techniques (e.g., parameter-shift rule) make such hybrid training impractical for realistic RL workloads, because every gradient step requires a prohibitive number of circuit evaluations and thus erodes the potential quantum advantage. We introduce qtDNN, a tangential surrogate that locally approximates a PQC with a small differentiable network trained on-the-fly from the same minibatch. Embedding qtDNN inside the computation graph yields scalable batch gradients while keeping the original quantum layer for inference. Building on qtDNN we design hDQNN-TD3, a hybrid deep quantum neural network for continuous-control reinforcement learning based on the TD3 architecture. On the high-dimensional Humanoid-v4 benchmark, our agent reaches a test return that surpasses classical TD3, SAC and PPO baselines trained with identical compute. To our knowledge this is the first PQC-enhanced policy that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art classical performance on Humanoid. qtDNN has the potential to reduce quantum-hardware calls significantly and is designed to be compatible with today's NISQ devices. The method opens a path toward applying hybrid quantum models to large-scale RL and other gradient-intensive machine-learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Arithmetic-based on Quantum Signal Processing</title>

Abstract: As in classical reversible computing, Quantum Arithmetic is typically seen as a set of tools that process binary data encoded into a quantum register to set the value of another quantum register. This article presents another approach to explain the Quantum Arithmetic in quantum computing. Here, Quantum Arithmetic is addressed with a matrix processing point of view. Quantum Arithmetic is a convenient way to construct the Query that implements the mathematical problem of interest. This approach is not only an interpretation with the matrix approach to encode the problem of interest; it also allows us to derive a new original technique to construct Quantum Arithmetic with the framework of embedded Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). This work uses the link between the eigenstate amplitude and the operator phase to transform the QSP processed amplitude into binary value extracted by Quantum Phase Estimation(QPE). The explanations allowing the QSP based Quantum Arithmetic construction let appear natively sub-routines and functions used by well-known algorithms such as Ancilla Quantum Encoding (AQE)'s Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm (HHL) and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). Methods to implement this circuit are presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic J-Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce quantum J-oscillators that exploit intrinsic nuclear spin-spin (scalar J) couplings in molecules to produce phase-coherent oscillations. Operated in zero magnetic field and driven by a digital feedback, they operate from sub-hertz to a few tens of hertz frequencies. In a proof-of-principle experiment on [15N]-acetonitrile, the oscillator produced a 337 uHz linewidth over 3000 s, more than two orders narrower than in conventional zero-field NMR. This may facilitate precision measurements of J-coupling constants and allows distinguishing mixtures of molecules whose zero-field NMR spectra would otherwise be hard to separate. In addition, the combination of strongly coupled spin systems and programmable feedback turns the J-oscillator into a compact tabletop (and, eventually, chip-scale) platform for exploring nonlinear spin dynamics, including chaos, dynamical phase transitions, and perhaps time-crystal behavior. By uniting high-resolution spectroscopy and controllable quantum dynamics in a single, magnet-free setup, J-oscillators open new opportunities for applications where ultraprecise frequency references or molecular fingerprints are required.</description>

      <title>Analytical Prediction of the Superradiant Emission Peak and Timing in Fully Excited Quantum Emitter Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for simulating the dynamics of an open electronic system on a quantum computer. This approach entails mid-circuit measurements and resets to simulate the addition or removal of electrons from the system. Our method provides a way to apply non-reversible operations to a quantum computer without the need for additional qubits. Using this method, we simulate the dynamics of an open electronic system consisting of a chain of electrons positioned between two conductive leads on the $ibm\_torino$ quantum computer. We expect the method to be generally applicable to open systems.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Range-Doppler Algorithm for Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a well established technology in the field of Earth remote sensing. Over the years, the resolution of SAR images has been steadily improving and the pixel count increasing as a result of advances in the sensor technology, and so have the computational resources required to process the raw data to a focused image. Because they are a necessary step in the study of the retrieved data, new high-resolution and low-complexity focusing algorithms are constantly explored in the SAR literature. The theory of quantum computing proposes a new computational framework that might allow to process a vast amount of data in a more efficient way. Relevant to our case is the advantage proven for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), the quantum counterpart of a fundamental element of many SAR focusing algorithms. Motivated by this, in this work we propose a quantum version of the range-Doppler algorithm. We show how in general reference functions, a key element in many SAR focusing algorithms, can be mapped to quantum gates; we present the quantum circuit performing the SAR raw data focusing and we discuss in detail its computational complexity. We find that the core of the quantum range-Doppler algorithm has a computational complexity, namely the number of single- and two-qubit gates, of $O(N)$, less than its classical counterpart with computational complexity $O(N \log N)$.</description>

Abstract: We design the information-acquiring von Neumann architecture of a computer in a fine-grained or coarse-grained model, where information is carried by classical bits. This architecture enables both a Hamiltonian process converting a given input pure state to another output pure state of the system to be considered (functionality) and a physical process to acquire information (subjectivity). The latter process is identified with the projection hypothesis in projective quantum measurement in the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spin states obtained by extracting $n$ electrons from closed-shell fermionic states. A partition of the system is defined through the introduction of the extraction modes. We derive the expression of the $n$-body reduced density matrices, which represent the extracted spin states. We show that these states exhibit different forms of spin entanglement, whose detection is discussed in terms of the spin squeezing inequalities.</description>

      <title>Optimizing QUBO on a quantum computer by mimicking imaginary time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving QUBO problems using an Imaginary Time Evolution-Mimicking Circuit (ITEMC). The circuit parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above 0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that from simulated annealing.</description>

Abstract: Supervised Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents an intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, aiming to use quantum resources to support model training and inference. This paper reviews recent developments in supervised QML, focusing on methods such as variational quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, and quantum kernel methods, along with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.</description>

The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>

Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying information tasks that offer advantages over their classical counterparts by exploiting quantum resources finds the usefulness of quantum information technologies. In this work, we introduce a two-party communication primitive, random exclusion code (REC), which is a single-shot prepare-and-measure protocol where a sender encodes a random message into a shorter sequence and a receiver attempts to exclude a randomly chosen letter in the original message. We present quantum advantages in RECs in two ways: probability and dimension. We show that RECs with quantum resources achieve higher success probabilities than classical strategies. We verify that the quantum resources required to describe detection events of RECs have a smaller dimension than classical ones. We also show that a guessing counterpart, random access codes (RACs), may not have a dimension advantage over classical resources. Our results elucidate various possibilities of achieving quantum advantages in two-party communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to transmit and preserve information at short time scales over an n-fold composition of quantum channels $(\Xi^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ modelled as a discrete quantum Markov semigroup, long enough to generate entanglement at some finite $n$. This is achieved by interspersing the action of noise with quantum error correction in succession. We show this by means of a non-trivial lower bound on the one-shot quantum capacity in the sequential setting as a function of $n$, in an attempt to model a linear quantum network and assess its capabilities to distribute entanglement. Intriguingly, the rate of transmission of such a network turns out to be a property of the spectrum of the channels composed in sequence, and the maximum possible error in transmission can be bounded as a function of the noise model only. As an application, we derive an exact error bound for the infinite dimensional pure-loss channel believed to be the dominant source of noise in networks precluding the distribution of entanglement. We exemplify our results by analysing the amplitude damping channel and its bosonic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</description>

A central one is how to efficiently represent both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom on the same platform, in order to develop computational strategies that can accurately capture strong electron-photon correlations at a reasonable cost for implementation on near-term hardware. Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic problem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional qubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms? To explore this, we investigate in this work three strategies: qubit-based, qudit-based, and hybrid qubit-qumode approaches. For each platform, we design compact, physically motivated quantum circuit ans\"{a}tze and integrate them within the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple polaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the development of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the native capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark all three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing characteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results show that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic eigen-energies and eigenstates. However, with respect to quantum resources required the hybrid qubit-qumode approach offers the most favorable tradeoff between resource efficiency and accuracy, followed closely by the qudit-based method. Both of which outperform the conventional qubit-based strategy. Our work presents a hardware-conscious comparison of quantum encoding strategies for polaritonic systems and highlights the potential of higher-dimensional quantum platforms to simulate complex light-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Fully Quantum Lattice Gas Automata Building Blocks for Computational Basis State Encodings</title>

Abstract: Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) is a classical method for simulating physical phenomena, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Quantum LGA (QLGA) is the family of methods that implement LGA schemes on quantum computers. In recent years, QLGA has garnered attention from researchers thanks to its potential of efficiently modeling CFD processes by either reducing memory requirements or providing simultaneous representations of exponentially many LGA states. In this work, we introduce novel building blocks for QLGA algorithms that rely on computational basis state encodings. We address every step of the algorithm, from initial conditions to measurement, and provide detailed complexity analyses that account for all discretization choices of the system under simulation. We introduce multiple ways of instantiating initial conditions, efficient boundary condition implementations for novel geometrical patterns, a novel collision operator that models less restricted interactions than previous implementations, and quantum circuits that extract quantities of interest out of the quantum state. For each building block, we provide intuitive examples and open-source implementations of the underlying quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Norm Inequality for Perturbed Quantum Evolutions and Its Application to Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of coherent control errors on quantum state evolution by deriving a general norm inequality based on Gronwall's lemma. This inequality provides an explicit upper bound on the deviation between an ideal quantum state and one subject to arbitrary coherent perturbations, including both time-dependent and time-independent cases. The framework is broadly applicable, requiring no assumptions about the detailed structure of the perturbation and full dynamics of the quantum system. We apply this approach to analyze the robustness of Grover's search algorithm in the presence of coherent errors. Our results characterizes quantitative scaling relations between the error strength, algorithm runtime, and success probability, offering practical guidelines for the design of resilient quantum protocols. We further compare the effects of time-dependent and time-independent perturbations, showing the distinctive ways in which coherent errors accumulate in quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Recently, large degeneracy based on product eigenstates has been found in spin ladders, kagome-like lattices, and motif magnetism, connected to spin liquids, anyonic phases, and quantum scars. We unify these systems by a complete classification of product eigenstates of Heisenberg XXZ Hamiltonians with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on general graphs in the form of Kirchhoff rules for spin supercurrent. By this, we construct spin systems with extensive degree of degeneracy linked to exotic condensates which could be studied in atomic gases and quantum spin lattices.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order in a group-based cluster state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at http://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023029]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$ cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum observables $H$ truncated on the range of orthogonal projections $\Pi_N$ of rank $N$, we study the corresponding Weyl symbol in the phase space in the semiclassical limit of vanishing Planck constant $\hbar\to0$ and large quantum number $N\to\infty$, with $\hbar N$ fixed. Under certain assumptions, we prove the $L^2$- convergence of the Weyl symbols to a symbol truncated (hence, in general discontinuous) on the classically allowed region in phase space. As an illustration of the general theorems we analyse truncated observables for the harmonic oscillator and for a free particle in a one-dimensional box. In the latter case, we also compute the microscopic pointwise limit of the symbols near the boundary of the classically allowed region.</description>

      <title>Stability and decay of subradiant patterns in a quantum gas with photon-mediated interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastability and its relaxation mechanisms challenge our understanding of the stability of quantum many-body systems, revealing a gap between the microscopic dynamics of the individual components and the effective descriptions used for macroscopic observables. We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system's typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab-initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime. Under weak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can be neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective strong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or ``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality factor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in molecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved without the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics approach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that necessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can occur in the weak coupling regime. We further discuss that certain quantum optical effects like fluorescence can be partially described as optical filtering, whereas some others like cavity-induced Raman scattering go beyond this. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena beyond optical filtering.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F\"orster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</description>

      <title>Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>
