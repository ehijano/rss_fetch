      <title>EyEar: Learning Audio Synchronized Human Gaze Trajectory Based on Physics-Informed Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitating how humans move their gaze in a visual scene is a vital research problem for both visual understanding and psychology, kindling crucial applications such as building alive virtual characters. Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</description>

      <title>HAIC: Improving Human Action Understanding and Generation with Better Captions for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made great progress in video understanding. However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 500 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 1,400 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</description>

      <title>DiffBrush:Just Painting the Art by Your Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of image generation and editing algorithms in recent years has enabled ordinary user to produce realistic images. However, the current AI painting ecosystem predominantly relies on text-driven diffusion models (T2I), which pose challenges in accurately capturing user requirements. Furthermore, achieving compatibility with other modalities incurs substantial training costs. To this end, we introduce DiffBrush, which is compatible with T2I models and allows users to draw and edit images. By manipulating and adapting the internal representation of the diffusion model, DiffBrush guides the model-generated images to converge towards the user's hand-drawn sketches for user's specific needs without additional training. DiffBrush achieves control over the color, semantic, and instance of objects in images by continuously guiding the latent and instance-level attention map during the denoising process of the diffusion model. Besides, we propose a latent regeneration, which refines the randomly sampled noise in the diffusion model, obtaining a better image generation layout. Finally, users only need to roughly draw the mask of the instance (acceptable colors) on the canvas, DiffBrush can naturally generate the corresponding instance at the corresponding location.</description>
