      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi polarons with multiple particle-hole excitations: Diagrammatic theory versus Chevy ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using both diagrammatic theory and Chevy ansatz approach, we derive an exact set of equations, which determines the spectral function of Fermi polarons with multiple particle-hole excitations at nonzero temperature. In the diagrammatic theory, we find out the complete series of Feynman diagrams for the multi-particle vertex functions, when the unregularized contact interaction strength becomes infinitesimal, a typical situation occurring in two- or three- dimensional free space. The latter Chevy ansatz approach is more widely applicable, allowing a nonzero interaction strength. We clarify the equivalence of the two approaches for an infinitesimal interaction strength and show that the variational coefficients in the Chevy ansatz are precisely the on-shell multi-particle vertex functions divided by an excitation energy. Truncated to a particular order of particle-hole excitations, our exact set of equations can be used to numerically calculate the finite-temperature polaron spectral function, once the numerical singularities in the equations are appropriately treated. As a concrete example, we calculate the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices, taking into account all the two-particle-hole excitations. We show that the inclusion of two-particle-hole excitations quantitatively improve the predictions on the polaron spectral function. Our results provide a useful way to solve the challenge problem of accurately predicting the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi polarons in three-dimensional free space. In addition, our clarification of the complete set of Feynman diagrams for the multi-particle polaron vertex functions may inspire the development of more accurate diagrammatic theories of population-imbalanced strongly interacting Fermi gases, beyond the conventional many-body $T$-matrix approximation.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Study on Superexchange Dynamics of Composite Spin-1 Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an experimental simulation of the spin-1 Heisenberg model with composite bosons in a one-dimensional chain based on the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Exploiting our site-and spin-resolved quantum gas microscope, we observed faster superexchange dynamics of the spin-1 system compared to its spin-1/2 counterpart, which is attributed to the enhancement effect of multi-bosons. We further probed the non-equilibrium spin dynamics driven by the superexchange and single-ion anisotropy terms, unveiling the linear expansion of the spin-spin correlations, which is limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. Based on the superexchange process, we prepared and verified the entangled qutrits pairs with these composite spin-1 bosons, potentially being applied in qutrit-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Parametric tuning of dynamical phase transitions in ultracold reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in ultracold chemistry have led to the possibility of a coherent transformation between ultracold atoms and molecules including between completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of generic interaction between the formed molecules can fundamentally alter the nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by this rather general interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical and numerical descriptions of these many-body effects, along with scaling laws for the reaction yield in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes, and highlight the potential experimental relevance in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Onsager vortex clusters on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Onsager vortex clustered states in a shell-shaped superfluid containing a large number of quantum vortices. In the incompressible limit and at low temperatures, the relevant problem can be boiled down to the statistical mechanics of neutral point vortices confined on a sphere. We analyze rotation free vortex clustered states within the mean field theory in the microcanonical ensemble. We find that the sandwich state, which involves the separating of vortices with opposite circulation and the clustering of vortices with same circulation around the poles and the equator, is the maximum entropy vortex distribution, subject to zero angular momentum constraint. The dipole momentum vanishes for the sandwich state and the quadrupole tensor serves as an order parameter to characterize the vortex cluster structure. For given finite angular momentum, the equilibrium vortex distribution forms a dipole structure, i.e., vortices with opposite sign are separated and are accumulated around the south and north pole, respectively. The conditions for the onset of clustering, and the exponents associated with the quadrupole moment and the dipole moment as functions of energy, are obtained within the mean field theory. At large energies, we obtain asymptotically exact vortex density distributions using the stereographic projection method, which give rise the parameter bounds for the vortex clustered states. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuating theory for one-dimensional shock waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves in repulsive one-dimensional Bose gases during the free expansion of a density hump. By building coherent Fermi states for interacting Bethe fermions, we define a quantum fluctuating initial state expressed in terms of universal quantities, namely the density and the Luttinger parameter. In the integrable case, this fluctuating state is then evolved by generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) and, differently from non-fluctuating initial states, it develops density ripples on top of the hydrodynamic mean value. Our analysis gives a general theory of quantum ripples and wave breaking in integrable and quasi-integrable one-dimensional liquids and clarifies the role of the interaction strength. In particular, for strongly/intermediately interacting bosons, we find quantum ripples originating from low-energy modes at the Fermi surface interfering when transported by GHD. In the low coupling limit, near the quasicondensate regime, we find instead that density ripples have a semi-classical nature, and their description requires information on the curvature of the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in $2+1$D~Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, high-energy eigenstates that evade the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here we achieve the first simultaneous demonstration of thermalization and memory in a quantum system. Using a Rydberg atom array, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states from different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in coupled one-dimensional quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the development of steady states in one-dimensional Bose gas tubes that are weakly coupled to one another through a density-density interaction. We analyze this development through a Boltzmann collision integral approach. We argue that when the leading order of the collision integral, where single particle-hole excitations are created in individual gases, is dominant, the state of the gas evolves first to a non-thermal fixed point, i.e. a prethermalization plateau. This order is dominant when a pair of tubes are inequivalent with, say, different temperatures or different effective interaction parameters, $\gamma$. We characterize this non-thermal prethermalization plateau, constructing both the quasi-conserved quantities that control the existence of this plateau as well as the associated generalized Gibbs ensemble.</description>

      <title>Delocalization in a partially disordered interacting many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a partially disordered one-dimensional system with interacting particles. Concretely, we impose a disorder potential to only every other site, followed by a clean site. Our numerical analysis of eigenstate properties is based on the entanglement entropy and density distributions. Most importantly, at large disorder, there exist eigenstates with large entanglement entropies and significant correlations between the clean sites. These states have volume-law scaling, embedded into a sea of area-law states, reminiscent of inverted quantum-scar states. These eigenstate features leave fingerprints in the nonequilibrium dynamics even in the large-disorder regime, with a strong initial-state dependence. We demonstrate that certain types of initial charge-density-wave states decay significantly, while others preserve their initial inhomogeneity, the latter being the typical behavior for many-body localized systems. This initial-condition dependent dynamics may give extra control over the delocalization dynamics at large disorder strength and should be experimentally feasible with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>
