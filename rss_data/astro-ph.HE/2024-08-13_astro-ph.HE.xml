      <title>Proof of principle X-ray reflection mass measurement of the black hole in H1743-322</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole X-ray binary H1743-322 lies in a region of the Galaxy with high extinction, and therefore it has not been possible to make a dynamical mass measurement. In this paper we make use of a recent model which uses the X-ray reflection spectrum to constrain the ratio of the black hole mass to the source distance. By folding in a reported distance measurement, we are able to estimate the mass of the black hole to be $12\pm2~\text{M}_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ credible interval). We are then able to revise a previous disc continuum fitting estimate of black hole spin $a_*$ (previously relying on a population mass distribution) using our new mass constraint, finding $a_*=0.47\pm0.10$. This work is a proof of principle demonstration of the method, showing it can be used to find the mass of black holes in X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Magnetar Fields: Chiral Magnetic Instability in Neutron Star Crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral magnetic instability in the crust of a neutron star as a potential mechanism for amplifying magnetic fields. This instability may become active when small deviations from chemical equilibrium are sustained over decades, driven by the star's gradual spin-down or residual heat loss. Our findings suggest that this mechanism can produce strong, large-scale magnetic fields consistent with models that align with observational data. Additionally, this instability naturally generates magnetic helicity in the star's crust, which is crucial for forming and maintaining strong dipolar toroidal fields, often invoked to explain magnetar observational phenomena. Our results offer a microphysically-based alternative to classical hydrodynamical dynamos for the origin of magnetar magnetic fields, addressing a long-standing debate in the field.</description>

      <title>Constraining twin stars with cold neutron star cooling data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a phase transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined quark phase inside a neutron star on its cooling behaviour. We take particular care that all equations of state under investigation are compatible with astrophysical constraints as well as are able to reproduce finite nuclear properties. We find that while the inferred neutrino luminosity of cold transiently-accreting star MXB $1659\text{-}29$ is reproduced in all of the constructed twin star models, the luminosity of colder source SAXJ $1808.4\text{-}3658$ cannot be described by equations of state with quark-hadron transition densities below $1.7$ saturation density, suggesting that twin stars with such low density transitions to the quark phase are not realized in nature. We also discuss how constraints to the quark-hadron phase transition density are strongly dependent on the cooling effectiveness of quark phase reactions.</description>

      <title>Large-scale cosmic ray anisotropies with 19 years of data from the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results are presented for the measurement of large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during 19 years of operation, prior to AugerPrime, the upgrade of the Observatory. The 3D dipole amplitude and direction are reconstructed above $4\,$EeV in four energy bins. Besides the established dipolar anisotropy in right ascension above $8\,$EeV, the Fourier amplitude of the $8$ to $16\,$EeV energy bin is now also above the $5\sigma$ discovery level. No time variation of the dipole moment above $8\,$EeV is found, setting an upper limit to the rate of change of such variations of $0.3\%$ per year at the $95\%$ confidence level. Additionally, the results for the angular power spectrum are shown, demonstrating no other statistically significant multipoles. The results for the equatorial dipole component down to $0.03\,$EeV are presented, using for the first time a data set obtained with a trigger that has been optimized for lower energies. Finally, model predictions are discussed and compared with observations, based on two source emission scenarios obtained in the combined fit of spectrum and composition above $0.6\,$EeV.</description>

      <title>Swift-XRT follow-up analysis of unidentified hard X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is currently established that the sources contributing to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) emission are mainly nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), in particular those that are obscured. Thus, it is important to fully identify the hard X-ray sky source population to accurately characterize the individual contribution of different AGNs to the overall CXB emission. We present a follow-up analysis of all the 218 sources marked as unidentified in our previous revision of the third release of the Palermo Swift-BAT hard X-ray catalog (3PBC) based on our multifrequency classification scheme. These 218 sources were classified as unidentified in our previous analyses because they lack an assigned low-energy counterpart. We searched for soft X-ray counterparts of these 218 3PBC sources in archival Swift-XRT observations obtained between 2005 January 1st and 2018 August 1st. In particular, we found 1213 archival Swift-XRT observations for 192 of the 218 unidentified sources. We found 93 possible Swift-XRT counterparts inside of the Swift-BAT positional uncertainty regions. These correspond to 73 3PBC sources, where 60 have only a single Swift-XRT detection, and 13 sources have multiple detections. We present a catalog of all the detected possible counterparts of the yet unidentified hard X-ray sources to the community as a catalog for future spectroscopic follow-up targets, together with a short catalog of our classification of the ten sources for which we found available spectra.</description>

      <title>How accurate are current $^{56}$Ni mass estimates in Type Ia Supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diversity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has become increasingly apparent with the rapid growth in observational data. Understanding the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia is crucial for their cosmological calibration and for advancing our knowledge of stellar physics. The estimation of $^{56}$Ni mass produced in these events is key to elucidating their explosion mechanism. This study compares two methods of $^{56}$Ni mass estimation. We first examine the relationship between peak luminosity and the second maximum in near-infrared (NIR) bands using observations of 18 nearby SNe Ia. Based on this relationship, we estimate the Ni mass for a set of nine well-observed SNe Ia using the Arnett rule. Additionally, we estimate the $^{56}$Ni mass using bolometric light curves of these SNe through energy conservation arguments. A comparison of these two estimation methods using Student's t-test reveals no statistically significant differences between the estimates. This finding suggests that both methods provide robust estimates of Ni mass in SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the stellar wind in Cyg X-1 via modelling of colour-colour diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cygnus X-1 is a high mass X-ray binary where accretion onto the black hole is mediated by the stellar wind from the blue supergiant companion star HDE 226868. Depending on the position of the black hole along the orbit, X-ray observations can probe different layers of the stellar wind. Deeper wind layers can be investigated at superior conjunction (i.e. null orbital phases). We aim at characterising the stellar wind in the Cyg X-1/HDE 226868 system analysing one passage at superior conjunction covered by XMM-Newton during the CHOCBOX campaign via modelling of colour-colour diagrams. Since X-ray absorption is energy-dependent, colour indices provide information on the parameters of the stellar wind, such as the column density $N_{H,w}$ and the covering factor $f_c$. We fitted colour-colour diagrams with models that include both a continuum and a stellar wind component. We used the KDE method to infer the unknown probability distribution of the data points in the colour-colour diagram, and selected the model corresponding to the highest likelihood. In order to study the temporal evolution of the wind around superior conjunction, we extracted and fitted time-resolved colour-colour diagrams. We found that the model that best describes the shape of the colour-colour diagram of Cyg X-1 at superior conjunction requires the wind to be partially ionised. The shape of the colour-colour diagram strongly varies during the analysed observation, as due to concurrent changes of the mean $N_{H,w}$ and the $f_c$ of the wind. Our results suggest the existence of a linear scaling between the rapid variability amplitude of $N_{H,w}$ (on time scales between 10 s and 11 ks) and its long term variations (on time scales 11&gt;ks). Using the inferred best-fit values, we estimated the stellar mass loss rate to be $\sim 7\times10^{-6} {\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and the clumps to have a mass of $\sim10^{17}$ g.</description>

      <title>The impact of the FREDDA dedispersion algorithm on $H_0$ estimations with FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio signals of extragalactic origins that are subjected to propagation effects such as dispersion and scattering. It follows then that these signals hold information regarding the medium they have traversed and are hence useful as cosmological probes of the Universe. Recently, FRBs were used to make an independent measure of the Hubble Constant $H_0$, promising to resolve the Hubble tension given a sufficient number of detected FRBs. Such cosmological studies are dependent on FRB population statistics, cosmological parameters and detection biases, and thus it is important to accurately characterise each of these. In this work, we empirically characterise the sensitivity of the Fast Real-time Engine for Dedispersing Amplitudes (FREDDA) which is the current detection system for the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We coherently redisperse high-time resolution data of 13 ASKAP-detected FRBs and inject them into FREDDA to determine the recovered signal-to-noise ratios as a function of dispersion measure (DM). We find that for 11 of the 13 FRBs, these results are consistent with injecting idealised pulses. Approximating this sensitivity function with theoretical predictions results in a systematic error of 0.3$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ on $H_0$ when it is the only free parameter. Allowing additional parameters to vary could increase this systematic by up to $\sim1\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. We estimate that this systematic will not be relevant until $\sim$400 localised FRBs have been detected, but will likely be significant in resolving the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Relativistic X-ray reflection from the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR~J17498-2921</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR~J17498-2921 went into X-ray outburst on April 13-15, 2023, for the first time since its discovery on August 11, 2011. Here, we report on the first follow-up \nustar{} observation of the source, performed on April 23, 2023, around ten days after the peak of the outburst. The \nustar{} spectrum of the persistent emission ($3-60$ \kev{} band) is well described by an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of $kT_{bb}=1.61\pm 0.04$\kev{}, most likely arising from the NS surface and a Comptonization component with power-law index $\Gamma=1.79\pm0.02$, arising from a hot corona at $kT_{e}=16\pm 2$ keV. The X-ray spectrum of the source shows robust reflection features which have not been observed before. We use a couple of self-consistent reflection models, {\tt relxill} and {\tt relxillCp}, to fit the reflection features. We find an upper limit to the inner disc radius of $ 6\: R_{ISCO}$ and $ 9\: R_{ISCO}$ from {\tt relxill} and {\tt relxillCp} model, respectively. The inclination of the system is estimated to be $\simeq 40\degr$ from both reflection models. Assuming magnetic truncation of the accretion disc, the upper limit of magnetic field strength at the pole of the NS is found to be $B\lesssim 1.8\times 10^{8}$ G. Furthermore, the \nustar{} observation revealed two type I X-ray bursts and the burst spectroscopy confirms the thermonuclear nature of the burst. The blackbody temperature reaches nearly $2.2$ keV at the peak of the burst.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic Oscillations in GRB 210514A: a Case of a Newborn Supra-Massive Precessing Magnetar Collapsing into a Black Hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetar is proposed as one of the possible central engines for a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Recent studies show that if a magnetar has a rotational axis misaligned from the magnetic one, a periodic lightcurve pattern is expected with a period of seconds to minutes. Inspired by this unique feature, in this paper, we search for the quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals in the {\it Swift} observations of GRBs. Using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the weighted wavelet Z-transform algorithms, we find that the {\it Swift}-BAT data of GRB 210514A has a QPO signal with a period $\sim 11\,{\rm s}$. The estimated confidence level of the signal is over $3 \sigma$. The global lightcurve of this GRB exhibits a double-plateau structure with a sharp decay segment between plateaus. The lightcurve feature resembles those of GRBs that were reported to have internal plateaus. We explain the observations of GRB 210514A with a supra-massive magnetar (SMM) model, where the QPO signal in the first plateau is produced via the dipole radiation of the SMM experiencing a precession motion, the sharp decay is due to the collapse of the SMM into a black hole (BH), and the second plateau could be produced via the fall-back accretion of the newborn BH. We fit the precession model to the observations using the Bayesian statistic and the best-fit magnetar parameters are discussed. Alternative models concerning a BH central engine may also provide reasonable explanations for this burst, only in this case the QPO signal could merely be a coincidence.</description>

      <title>Infant Type Ia Supernovae from the KMTNet I. Multi-Color Evolution and Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of the early multi-band light curves and colors of 19 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network SN Program, including 16 previously unpublished events. Seven are detected $\lesssim$ 1 day since the estimated epoch of first light and the rest within $\lesssim$ 3 days. Some show excess emission within $&lt;$ 0.5 days to $\sim$ 2 days, but most show pure power-law rises. The colors are initially diverse before $\sim$ 5 days, but converge to a similar color at $\sim$ 10 days. We identify at least three populations based on 2--5-day color evolution: (1) "early-blues" exhibit slowly-evolving colors consistent with a $\sim$ 17,000 K blackbody; (2) "early-reds" have initially blue $B-V$ and red $V-i$ colors that cannot simultaneously be fit with a blackbody -- likely due to suppression of $B$- and $i$-band flux by Fe II/III and Ca II -- and evolve more rapidly; and (3) "early-yellows" evolve blueward, consistent with thermal heating from $\sim$ 8,000 to 13,000 K. The distributions of early-blue and early-red colors are compatible with them being either distinct populations -- with early-reds comprising (60 $\pm$ 15)% of them -- or extreme ends of one continuous population; whereas the early-yellow population identified here is clearly distinct. Compared to the other populations, early-blues in our sample differ by exhibiting excess emission within 1--2 days, nearly constant peak brightness regardless of $\Delta M_{15}(B)$ after standardization, and shallower Si II features. Early-blues also prefer star-forming host environments, while early-yellows and, to a lesser extent, early-reds prefer quiescent ones. These preferences appear to indicate at least two Type Ia SN production channels based on stellar population age, while early-reds and early-blues may still share a common origin.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet flux and spectral variability study of blazars observed with UVIT/AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, the peculiar class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are known to show flux variations across the accessible electromagnetic spectrum. Though they have been studied extensively for their flux variability characteristics across wavelengths, information on their ultraviolet (UV) flux variations on time scales of hours is very limited. Here, we present the first UV flux variability study on intraday time scales of a sample of 10 blazars comprising 2 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 8 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). These objects, spanning a redshift (z) range of 0.034 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.003, were observed in the far-UV (FUV: 1300 - 1800 \text{\AA}) and near-UV (NUV: 2000 - 3000 \text{\AA}) wavebands using the ultraviolet imaging telescope on board AstroSat. UV flux variations on time scales of hours were detected in 9 sources out of the observed 10 blazars. The spectral variability analysis showed a bluer-when-brighter trend with no difference in the UV spectral variability behavior between the studied sample of FSRQs and BL Lacs. The observed UV flux and spectral variability in our sample of both FSRQs and BL Lacs revealed that the observed UV emission in them is dominated by jet synchrotron process.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave emission in Binary Neutron Star early post-merger within a dark environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an effective Lagrangian model inspired by [1] we describe the early post-merger of a binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger event with a non-vanishing ambient fraction of dark matter. For this we mimic the dynamics of two oscillating Neutron Star (NS) masses in the gravitational potential well as they merge. We parametrize the ejected baryonic matter fraction in the coalescence event forming a surrounding debris disk containing a non-vanishing dark matter fraction. In order to analyze the dark contribution, we start from a dark-matter free modelization using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques to replicate the gravitational waveforms obtained from simulations in the CoRe database for three selected equations of state for NS matter (DD2, BHBlp, SFHo). Later, we explore the impact of a dark viscous fluid under a prescribed velocity dependent force and obtain the waveforms and spectral properties originating in the first few ms in the BNS post-merger. Finally we discuss our findings in light of the prospects of detectability of a non-vanishing fraction of dark matter arising in the waveforms and power spectral distribution in present or future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Tests of General Relativity with Ground-Based Detectors and Pulsar-Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review is focused on tests of Einstein's theory of general relativity with gravitational waves that are detectable by ground-based interferometers and pulsar-timing experiments. Einstein's theory has been greatly constrained in the quasi-linear, quasi-stationary regime, where gravity is weak and velocities are small. Gravitational waves are allowing us to probe a complimentary, yet previously unexplored regime: the non-linear and dynamical \emph{extreme gravity regime}. Such a regime is, for example, applicable to compact binaries coalescing, where characteristic velocities can reach fifty percent the speed of light and gravitational fields are large and dynamical. This review begins with the theoretical basis and the predicted gravitational-wave observables of modified gravity theories. The review continues with a brief description of the detectors, including both gravitational-wave interferometers and pulsar-timing arrays, leading to a discussion of the data analysis formalism that is applicable for such tests. The review then discusses gravitational-wave tests using compact binary systems, and ends with a description of the first gravitational wave observations by advanced LIGO, the stochastic gravitational wave background observations by pulsar timing arrays, and the tests that can be performed with them..</description>

      <title>postmerger: A flexible mapping of ringdown amplitudes for non-precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remnant black hole from a binary coalescence emits ringdown gravitational waves characterized by quasi-normal modes, which depend solely on the remnant's mass and spin. In contrast, the ringdown amplitudes and phases are determined by the properties of the merging progenitors. Accurately modeling these amplitudes and phases reduces systematic biases in parameter estimation and enables the development and performance of rigorous tests of general relativity. We present a state-of-the-art, data-driven surrogate model for ringdown amplitudes and phases, leveraging Gaussian Process Regression trained against SXS numerical-relativity simulations. Focusing on non-precessing, quasi-circular binary black holes, our model offers the most comprehensive fit that includes 16 emission modes, incorporating overtones and quadratic contributions. Our surrogate model achieves reconstruction errors that are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical measurement errors of current gravitational-wave interferometers. An additional benefit of our approach is its flexibility, which allows for future extensions to include features such as eccentricity and precession, broadening the scope of its applicability to more generic astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we are releasing our model in a ready-to-use package called postmerger.</description>

      <title>Observed jet power and radiative efficiency of black hole candidates in Kerr + PFDM model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we explore the electromagnetic energy emitted by astrophysical black holes within the Kerr+PFDM spacetime, a model encompassing rotating black holes surrounded by dark matter. Our investigation focuses on black holes within X-ray binary systems, namely GRS 1915+105, GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, A0620-00, H1743-322, and GRS 1124-683. Our findings indicate that the Kerr+PFDM spacetime can account for the radiative efficiency of these sources as determined through the continuum fitting method (CFM). Additionally, employing the Blandford-Znajeck mechanism, we demonstrate the ability to replicate the observed jet power. By combining the outcomes of both analyses for the selected objects, we establish more rigorous constraints on the spacetime parameters. Notably, our results reveal that similar to the Kerr spacetime, the Kerr+PFDM spacetime cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Burning in Accretion Flow of Helium-rich matter onto Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impacts of nuclear burning on the spherically symmetric stationary accretion flow of helium-rich matter on to compact objects. We have already shown the existence of the critical accretion rates for the accretion of CO-rich matter above which the flow truncates in the supersonic region due to nuclear burning in the previous paper \citep{2022ApJ...933...29N}. Here, we show that there are also critical accretion rates for helium-rich matter. While we used empirical formulae for the energy generation rates for carbon burning and oxygen burning without solving the nuclear reaction network in our previous work, we solve a simple nuclear reaction network consisting of 13 elements from $^4$He to $^{56}$Ni to investigate influence of the energy generation from not only triple-$\alpha$ reactions but also the subsequent reactions of synthesized elements. We have also qualitatively confirmed the previous results for CO-rich matter accretion using the revised code with the nuclear reaction network and reported some new findings.</description>

      <title>Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Cross Sections and Inelasticity Distributions of High-Energy Neutrino Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive model for neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) cross sections spanning energies from 50 GeV to 5$\times10^{12}$ GeV with an emphasis on applications to neutrino telescopes. We provide calculations of the total charged-current DIS cross sections and inelasticity distributions up to NNLO for isoscalar nucleon targets and up to NLO order for nuclear targets. Several modifications to the structure functions are applied to improve the modeling of the cross sections at low energies where perturbative QCD is less accurate and at high energies where there is non-negligible top quark production, and small-$x$ logarithms need to be resumed. Using the FONLL general-mass variable-flavor number scheme, we account for heavy quark mass effects and separate the heavy flavor components of the structure functions, obtaining predictions of their relative contributions to the cross sections and the uncertainties arising from the parton distribution functions. Additionally, the effects of final state radiation are implemented in the calculation of the double-differential cross section and discussed in terms of their impact on measurements at neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Two radio cores in GPS J1543-0757: a new dual supermassive black hole system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of a dual supermassive black hole system in the radio galaxy J1543-0757, with a projected separation between the two black holes of 46 mas. The result is based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of J1543-0757. Multiepoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The flat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support that these radio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hot spots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close dual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Density Distribution of Plasmas Resembling Dark Matter Halo Due to Ionization lag and Ambipolar Electric Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a spherically symmetric plasma constrained by its own gravity, the ionization degree lags behind changes in temperature and density. The ambipolar electric field accelerates ions radially and cools electrons. Ions lose energy and angular momentum in collisions with low-temperature electrons. The angular momentum of ions decreases much faster than their energy in cycles. The trajectories of ions are close to radial, and the density distribution resembles pseudo-isothermal.
  The velocity distributions of baryons moving outward and inward in galaxies tend to approach independent Maxwell distributions. This characteristic suppresses small-angle scattering of ions, reducing the ion collision cross-section by three orders of magnitude. In the massive galaxies, baryons can replace all dark matter.</description>

      <title>A magnetised Galactic halo from inner Galaxy outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale magnetic fields are observed off the midplanes of disk galaxies, indicating that they harbour magnetised halos. These halos are crucial to studies of galaxy evolution, galactic-scale outflows, and feedback from star formation activity. Identifying the magnetised halo of the Milky Way is challenging because of the potential contamination from foreground emission arising in local spiral arms. Additionally, it is unclear how our magnetic halo is influenced by recently revealed large-scale structures such as the X-ray emitting eROSITA Bubbles, which, according to previous simulations, might be transient structures powered by the Galactic Center or the Galaxy's star-forming ring. Here we report the identification of several kpc-scale magnetised structures based on their polarized radio emission and their gamma-ray counterparts, which can be interpreted as the radiation of relativistic electrons. These non-thermal structures extend far above and below the Galactic plane and are spatially coincident with the thermal X-ray emission from the eROSITA Bubbles. The morphological consistency of these structures suggests a common origin, which can be sustained by Galactic outflows driven by the active star-forming regions located at 3-5 kpc from the Galactic Centre. These results reveal how X-ray-emitting and magnetised halos of spiral galaxies can be related to intense star formation activities and suggest that the X-shaped coherent magnetic structures observed in their halos can stem from galaxy outflows.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Very High Energy {\gamma}-rays in the Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 4278, a Low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), is generally classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission line region (LINER). Recently, it has been reported to be associated with a very high energy $\gamma$-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915 in the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory source catalog. However, no associated counterpart has been detected by analyzing the data collected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By analyzing its X-ray observation data from Swift-XRT, we find NGC 4278 is in a high-flux state on MJD 59546, with the X-ray flux more than one order of magnitude higher than that observed $\sim$ 11.7 year earlier by Chandra. Interestingly, this Swift-XRT observation was conducted during the active phase of the $\gamma$-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915. We propose that the detection of VHE $\gamma$-rays from NGC 4278 may be attributed to the presence of an active nucleus in its center. To reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGC 4278, we employ a one-zone leptonic model, typically used for fitting broadband SEDs of BL Lacs, and find that a smaller magnetic field strength is required than that of typical TeV BL Lacs. Furthermore, NGC 4278 exhibits significantly lower luminosity in both radio and TeV bands when compared with typical TeV BL Lacs. In the radio-luminosity vs. Eddington-ratio plane, NGC 4278 shows greater similarity to Seyfert galaxies and LINERs rather than BL Lacs; however, it still roughly follows the extension towards lower luminosity seen in BL Lacs.</description>

      <title>Very-long-baseline interferometry study of the flaring blazar TXS 1508+572 in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-redshift blazars provide valuable input to studies of the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and provide constraints on cosmological models. Detections at high energies ($0.1&lt;\mathrm{E}&lt;100$ GeV) of these distant sources are rare, but when they exhibit bright gamma-ray flares, we are able to study them. However, contemporaneous multi-wavelength observations of high-redshift objects ($z&gt;4$) during their different periods of activity have not been carried out so far. An excellent opportunity for such a study arose when the blazar TXS 1508+572 ($z=4.31$) exhibited a $\gamma$-ray flare in 2022 February in the $0.1-300$ GeV range with a flux 25 times brighter than the one reported in the in the fourth catalog of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope. Our goal is to monitor the morphological changes, spectral index and opacity variations that could be associated with the preceding $\gamma$-ray flare in TXS 1508+572 to find the origin of the high-energy emission in this source. We also plan to compare the source characteristics in the radio band to the blazars in the local Universe ($z&lt;0.1$). In addition, we aim to collect quasi-simultaneous data to our multi-wavelength observations of the object, making TXS 1508+572 the first blazar in the early Universe ($z&gt;4$) with contemporaneous multi-frequency data available in its high state. In order to study the parsec-scale structure of the source, we performed three epochs of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) follow-up observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) supplemented with the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope at 15, 22, and 43 GHz, which corresponds to 80, 117, and 228 GHz in the rest frame of TXS 1508+572. In addition, one 86 GHz (456 GHz) measurement was performed by the VLBA and the Green Bank Telescope during the first epoch.</description>

      <title>Structured Jet Model for Multiwavelength Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT 2022cmc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AT 2022cmc is a recently documented tidal disruption event (TDE) that exhibits a luminous jet, accompanied by fast-declining X-ray and long-lasting radio/millimeter emission. Motivated by the distinct spectral and temporal signatures between X-ray and radio observations, we propose a multizone model involving relativistic jets with different Lorentz factors. We systematically study the evolution of the faster and slower jets in an external density profile, considering the continuous energy injection rate associated with the time-dependent accretion rates before and after the mass fallback time. We investigate time-dependent multiwavelength emission from both the forward shock and reverse shock regions of the fast and slow jets, in a self-consistent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that the energy injection rate can significantly impact the jet evolution and subsequently influence the lightcurves. We find that the X-ray spectra and lightcurves can be described by the electron synchrotron emission from the reverse shock of the faster jet, in which the late-time X-ray upper limits, extending to 400 days after the disruption, could be interpreted as the jet break steepening. Meanwhile, the radio observations can be interpreted as a result of synchrotron emissions from the forward shock region of the slower jet. We also discuss prospects for testing the model with current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Influences of modified Chaplygin dark fluid around a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a static, spherically charged AdS black hole within a modified cosmological Chaplygin gas (MCG), adhering to the calorific equation of state, as a unified dark fluid model of dark energy and dark matter. We explore the influence of model parameters on several characteristics of the MCG-motivated charged AdS black hole (MCG-AdSBH), including the geodesic structure and some astrophysical phenomena such as null trajectories, shadow silhouettes, light deflection angles, and the determination of greybody bounds. We then discuss how the model parameters affect the Hawking temperature, remnant radius, and evaporation process of the MCG-AdSBH. Quasinormal modes are also investigated using the eikonal approximation method. Constraints on the MCG-AdSBH parameters are derived from EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, suggesting that MCG-AdSBH could be strong candidates for astrophysical black hole.</description>

      <title>Compactness of supermassive dark objects at galactic centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define compactness of a gravitational lens as the scaled closest distance of approach (i.e., $r_0/M$) of the null geodesic giving rise to an image. We model forty supermassive dark objects as Schwarzschild lenses and compute compactness of lenses (determined by the formation of the first order relativistic image). We then obtain a novel formula for the compactness of a lens as a function of mass to the distance ratio ($M/D_d$) and the ratio of lens-source to the observer-source distances ($D_{ds}/D_s$). This formula yields a very important result: Just an observation of a relativistic image would give an incredibly accurate upper bound to the physical compactness (the ratio of the radius to mass) of the lens without having any knowledge of mass of the lens, angular source position, and observer-source and lens-source distances. Similarly, we show that the observation of the second order relativistic image would give a lower value of upper bound to the physical compactness. These results, though obtained for supermassive dark objects at galactic centers, are valid for any object compact enough to give rise to relativistic images.</description>

      <title>Refine Neutrino Events Reconstruction with BEiT-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino Events Reconstruction has always been crucial for IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In the Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", many solutions use Transformer. We present ISeeCube, a pure Transformer model based on TorchScale (the backbone of BEiT-3). When having relatively same amount of total trainable parameters, our model outperforms the 2nd place solution. By using TorchScale, the lines of code drop sharply by about 80% and a lot of new methods can be tested by simply adjusting configs. We compared two fundamental models for predictions on a continuous space, regression and classification, trained with MSE Loss and CE Loss respectively. We also propose a new metric, overlap ratio, to evaluate the performance of the model. Since the model is simple enough, it has the potential to be used for more purposes such as energy reconstruction, and many new methods such as combining it with GraphNeT can be tested more easily. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ChenLi2049/ISeeCube</description>

      <title>Extracting linear and nonlinear quasinormal modes from black hole merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, when two black holes merge they produce a rotating (Kerr) black hole remnant. According to perturbation theory, the remnant emits "ringdown" radiation: a superposition of exponentials with characteristic complex frequencies that depend only on the remnant's mass and spin. While the goal of the black hole spectroscopy program is to measure the quasinormal mode frequencies, a knowledge of their amplitudes and phases is equally important to determine which modes are detectable, and possibly to perform additional consistency checks. Unlike the complex frequencies, the amplitudes and phases depend on the properties of the binary progenitors, such as the binary mass ratio and component spins. In this paper we develop a fitting algorithm designed to reliably identify the modes present in numerical simulations and to extract their amplitudes and phases. We apply the algorithm to over 500 binary black hole simulations from the public SXS numerical relativity simulation catalog, and we present fitting formulas for the resulting mode amplitudes and phases as functions of the properties of the progenitors. Crucially, our algorithm allows for the extraction of not only prograde fundamental modes and overtones, but also retrograde modes and second-order modes. We unveil interesting relations for the amplitude ratios of different modes. The fitting code and interactive versions of some of the plots are publicly available. The results presented in this paper can be updated as more and better simulations become available.</description>

      <title>Superradiant instability of area quantized Kerr black hole with discrete reflectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints from synchrotron emission on very massive decaying dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the cosmological dark matter (DM) couples to Standard Model (SM) fields, it can decay promptly to SM states in a highly energetic hard process, which subsequently showers and hadronizes to give stable particles including $e^\pm$, $\gamma$, $p^{\pm}$ and $\nu\bar{\nu}$ at lower energy. If the DM particle is very heavy, the high-energy $e^\pm$, due to the Klein-Nishina cross section suppression, preferentially lose energy via synchrotron emission which, in turn, can be of unusually high energies. Here, we present previously unexplored bounds on heavy decaying DM up to the Planck scale, by studying the synchrotron emission from the $e^\pm$ produced in the ambient Galactic magnetic field. In particular, we explore the sensitivity of the resulting constraints on the DM decay width to (i) different SM decay channels, to (ii) the Galactic magnetic field configurations, and (iii) to various different DM density profiles proposed in the literature. We find that constraints from the synchrotron component complement and improve on constraints from very high-energy cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observatories targeting the prompt emission when the DM is sufficiently massive, most significantly for masses in excess of $10^{12}\text{ GeV}$.</description>

Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves undergo no absorption or dissipation when traversing through a perfect fluid. However, in the presence of a viscous fluid, GWs transfer energy to the fluid medium. In this paper, we present a review of our recent series of results regarding the interaction between gravitational waves and surrounding matter. Additionally, we examine the impact of a viscous fluid shell on gravitational wave propagation, focusing particularly on GW damping and GW heating. Furthermore, we explore the significance of these effects in various astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse Supernovae and primordial gravitational waves.</description>
