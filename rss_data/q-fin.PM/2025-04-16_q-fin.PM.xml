      <title>Breaking the Trend: How to Avoid Cherry-Picked Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our empirical results, illustrated in Fig.5, show an impressive fit with the pretty complex theoritical Sharpe formula of a Trend following strategy depending on the parameter of the signal, which was derived by Grebenkov and Serror (2014). That empirical fit convinces us that a mean-reversion process with only one time scale is enough to model, in a pretty precise way, the reality of the trend-following mechanism at the average scale of CTAs and as a consequence, using only one simple EMA, appears optimal to capture the trend. As a consequence, using a complex basket of different complex indicators as signal, do not seem to be so rational or optimal and exposes to the risk of cherry-picking.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: A Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization for Continuous-Time Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large-scale, continuous-time portfolio optimization problems involving numerous assets and state-dependent dynamics has long been challenged by the curse of dimensionality. Traditional dynamic programming and PDE-based methods, while rigorous, typically become computationally intractable beyond a small number of state variables (often limited to ~3-6 in prior numerical studies). To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the \emph{Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization} (PG-DPO) framework. PG-DPO leverages Pontryagin's Maximum Principle to directly guide neural network policies via backpropagation-through-time, naturally incorporating exogenous state processes without requiring dense state grids. Crucially, our computationally efficient ``Two-Stage'' variant exploits rapidly stabilizing costate estimates derived from BPTT, converting them into near-optimal closed-form Pontryagin controls after only a short warm-up, significantly reducing training overhead. This enables a breakthrough in scalability: numerical experiments demonstrate that PG-DPO successfully tackles problems with dimensions previously considered far out of reach, optimizing portfolios with up to 50 assets and 10 state variables. The framework delivers near-optimal policies, offering a practical and powerful alternative for high-dimensional continuous-time portfolio choice.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>
