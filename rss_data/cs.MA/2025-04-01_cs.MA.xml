      <title>$\textit{Agents Under Siege}$: Breaking Pragmatic Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Optimized Prompt Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most discussions about Large Language Model (LLM) safety have focused on single-agent settings but multi-agent LLM systems now create novel adversarial risks because their behavior depends on communication between agents and decentralized reasoning. In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a $\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses, including variants of $\texttt{Llama-Guard}$ and $\texttt{PromptGuard}$, fail to prohibit our attack, emphasizing the urgent need for multi-agent specific safety mechanisms.</description>

      <title>AgentNet: Decentralized Evolutionary Coordination for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of multi-agent systems, where multiple LLM-based agents collaborate to solve complex tasks. However, existing systems predominantly rely on centralized coordination, which introduces scalability bottlenecks, limits adaptability, and creates single points of failure. Additionally, concerns over privacy and proprietary knowledge sharing hinder cross-organizational collaboration, leading to siloed expertise. To address these challenges, we propose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that enables LLM-based agents to autonomously evolve their capabilities and collaborate efficiently in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-structured network. Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that depend on static role assignments or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to specialize dynamically, adjust their connectivity, and route tasks without relying on predefined workflows. AgentNet's core design is built upon several key innovations: (1) Fully Decentralized Paradigm: Removing the central orchestrator, allowing agents to coordinate and specialize autonomously, fostering fault tolerance and emergent collective intelligence. (2) Dynamically Evolving Graph Topology: Real-time adaptation of agent connections based on task demands, ensuring scalability and resilience.(3) Adaptive Learning for Expertise Refinement: A retrieval-based memory system that enables agents to continuously update and refine their specialized skills. By eliminating centralized control, AgentNet enhances fault tolerance, promotes scalable specialization, and enables privacy-preserving collaboration across organizations. Through decentralized coordination and minimal data exchange, agents can leverage diverse knowledge sources while safeguarding sensitive information.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Multi-Agent Systems with Petri nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the interaction between components is crucial for many applications and serves as a fundamental step in analyzing and verifying properties in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we propose a method based on 1-safe Petri nets to model Asynchronous Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS), starting from two semantics defined on AMAS represented as transition systems. Specifically, we focus on two types of synchronization: synchronization on transitions and synchronization on data. For both, we define an operator that composes 1-safe Petri nets and demonstrate the relationships between the composed Petri net and the global transition systems as defined in theliterature. Additionally, we analyze the relationships between the two semantics on Petri nets, proposing two constructions that enable switching between them. These transformations are particularly useful for system analysis, as they allow the selection of the most suitable model based on the property that needs to be verified.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Autonomous Industrial Vehicle Fleet Using Fuzzy Agents: Application to Task Allocation and Battery Charge Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research introduces a multi-agent simulation that uses fuzzy inference to investigate the work distribution and battery charging control of mobile baggage conveyor robots in an airport in a comprehensive manner. Thanks to a distributed system, this simulation approach provides high adaptability, adjusting to changes in conveyor agent availability, battery capacity, awareness of the activities of the conveyor fleet, and knowledge of the context of infrastructure resource availability. Dynamic factors, such as workload variations and communication between the conveyor agents and infrastructure are considered as heuristics, highlighting the importance of flexible and collaborative approaches in autonomous systems. The results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive fuzzy multi-agent models to optimize dynamic task allocation, adapt to the variation of baggage arrival flows, improve the overall operational efficiency of conveyor agents, and reduce their energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Provably Stable Multi-Agent Routing with Bounded-Delay Adversaries in the Decision Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying multi-agent routing settings, where adversarial agents are part of the assignment and decision loop, degrading the performance of the fleet by incurring bounded delays while servicing pickup-and-delivery requests. Specifically, we are interested in characterizing conditions on the fleet size and the proportion of adversarial agents for which a routing policy remains stable, where stability for a routing policy is achieved if the number of outstanding requests is uniformly bounded over time. To obtain this characterization, we first establish a threshold on the proportion of adversarial agents above which previously stable routing policies for fully cooperative fleets are provably unstable. We then derive a sufficient condition on the fleet size to recover stability given a maximum proportion of adversarial agents. We empirically validate our theoretical results on a case study on autonomous taxi routing, where we consider transportation requests from real San Francisco taxicab data.</description>

      <title>LayerCraft: Enhancing Text-to-Image Generation with CoT Reasoning and Layered Object Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation (T2I) has become a key area of research with broad applications. However, existing methods often struggle with complex spatial relationships and fine-grained control over multiple concepts. Many existing approaches require significant architectural modifications, extensive training, or expert-level prompt engineering. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{LayerCraft}, an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for structured procedural generation. LayerCraft enables users to customize objects within an image and supports narrative-driven creation with minimal effort. At its core, the system includes a coordinator agent that directs the process, along with two specialized agents: \textbf{ChainArchitect}, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate a dependency-aware 3D layout for precise instance-level control, and the \textbf{Object-Integration Network (OIN)}, which utilizes LoRA fine-tuning on pre-trained T2I models to seamlessly blend objects into specified regions of an image based on textual prompts without requiring architectural changes. Extensive evaluations demonstrate LayerCraft's versatility in applications ranging from multi-concept customization to storytelling. By providing non-experts with intuitive, precise control over T2I generation, our framework democratizes creative image creation. Our code will be released upon acceptance at github.com/PeterYYZhang/LayerCraft</description>

      <title>SciReplicate-Bench: Benchmarking LLMs in Agent-driven Algorithmic Reproduction from Research Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in generating code from algorithm descriptions from recent NLP papers. The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a multi-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implement solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful Non-Reasoning LLMs and Reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using Sci-Reproducer achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We will open-source our benchmark, and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench.</description>

      <title>Agentic Multimodal AI for Hyperpersonalized B2B and B2C Advertising in Competitive Markets: An AI-Driven Competitive Advertising Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing use of foundation models (FMs) in real-world applications demands adaptive, reliable, and efficient strategies for dynamic markets. In the chemical industry, AI-discovered materials drive innovation, but commercial success hinges on market adoption, requiring FM-driven advertising frameworks that operate in-the-wild. We present a multilingual, multimodal AI framework for autonomous, hyper-personalized advertising in B2B and B2C markets. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal reasoning, and adaptive persona-based targeting, our system generates culturally relevant, market-aware ads tailored to shifting consumer behaviors and competition. Validation combines real-world product experiments with a Simulated Humanistic Colony of Agents to model consumer personas, optimize strategies at scale, and ensure privacy compliance. Synthetic experiments mirror real-world scenarios, enabling cost-effective testing of ad strategies without risky A/B tests. Combining structured retrieval-augmented reasoning with in-context learning (ICL), the framework boosts engagement, prevents market cannibalization, and maximizes ROAS. This work bridges AI-driven innovation and market adoption, advancing multimodal FM deployment for high-stakes decision-making in commercial marketing.</description>

      <title>Personality-Driven Decision-Making in LLM-Based Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The embedding of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents is a rapidly developing field which enables dynamic, configurable behaviours without the need for extensive domain-specific training. In our previous work, we introduced SANDMAN, a Deceptive Agent architecture leveraging the Five-Factor OCEAN personality model, demonstrating that personality induction significantly influences agent task planning. Building on these findings, this study presents a novel method for measuring and evaluating how induced personality traits affect task selection processes - specifically planning, scheduling, and decision-making - in LLM-based agents. Our results reveal distinct task-selection patterns aligned with induced OCEAN attributes, underscoring the feasibility of designing highly plausible Deceptive Agents for proactive cyber defense strategies.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Causal Mechanism of Political Opinion Dynamics: A Model of Hierarchical Coarse-Graining with Community-Bounded Social Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing polarization in democratic societies is an emergent outcome of political opinion dynamics. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of political opinions, from individual beliefs to collective consensus, remain unknown. Understanding that a causal mechanism must account for both bottom-up and top-down influences, we conceptualize political opinion dynamics as hierarchical coarse-graining, where microscale opinions integrate into a macro-scale state variable. Using the CODA (Continuous Opinions Discrete Actions) model, we simulate Bayesian opinion updating, social identity-based information integration, and migration between social identity groups to represent higher-level connectivity. This results in coarse-graining across micro, meso, and macro levels. Our findings show that higher-level connectivity shapes information integration, yielding three regimes: independent (disconnected, local convergence), parallel (fast, global convergence), and iterative (slow, stepwise convergence). In the iterative regime, low connectivity fosters transient diversity, indicating an informed consensus. In all regimes, time-scale separation leads to downward causation, where agents converge on the aggregate majority choice, driving consensus. Critically, any degree of coherent higher-level information integration can overcome misalignment via global downward causation. The results highlight how emergent properties of the causal mechanism, such as downward causation, are essential for consensus and may inform more precise investigations into polarized political discourse.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Scalable Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety and scalability are two critical challenges faced by practical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms that rely solely on reward shaping are ineffective in ensuring safety, and their scalability is rather limited due to the fixed-size network output. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Scalable Safe MARL (SS-MARL), to enhance the safety and scalability of MARL methods. Leveraging the inherent graph structure of MAS, we design a multi-layer message passing network to aggregate local observations and communications of varying sizes. Furthermore, we develop a constrained joint policy optimization method in the setting of local observation to improve safety. Simulation experiments demonstrate that SS-MARL achieves a better trade-off between optimality and safety compared to baselines, and its scalability significantly outperforms the latest methods in scenarios with a large number of agents.</description>

      <title>Learning in Conjectural Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the formalism of Conjectural Variations games to Stackelberg games involving multiple leaders and a single follower. To solve these nonconvex games, a common assumption is that the leaders compute their strategies having perfect knowledge of the follower's best response. However, in practice, the leaders may have little to no knowledge about the other players' reactions. To deal with this lack of knowledge, we assume that each leader can form conjectures about the other players' best responses, and update its strategy relying on these conjectures. Our contributions are twofold: (i) On the theoretical side, we introduce the concept of Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibrium -- keeping our formalism conjecture agnostic -- with Stackelberg Equilibrium being a refinement of it. (ii) On the algorithmic side, we introduce a two-stage algorithm with guarantees of convergence, which allows the leaders to first learn conjectures on a training data set, and then update their strategies. Theoretical results are illustrated numerically.</description>
