      <title>Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy -- A Textbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each method from first principles with complete mathematical development, emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the era of large astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Laser ablated sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating on an alumina lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used laser ablation to fabricate sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating (SWS-ARC) on a 5 cm diameter alumina lens. With an aspect ratio of 2.5, the SWS-ARC are designed to give a broad-band low reflectance response between 110 and 290 GHz. SWS shape measurements conducted on both sides of the lens give 303 $\mu$m pitch and total height between 750 and 790 $\mu$m, matching or exceeding the aspect ratio design values. Millimeter-wave transmittance measurements in a band between 140 and 260 GHz show the increase in transmittance expected with the ARC when compared to finite element analysis electromagnetic simulations. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SWS-ARC on an alumina lens, opening the path for implementing the technique for larger diameter lenses.</description>

      <title>NIR filter transformations across the HR diagram: JWST, Roman, and Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new color transformations between select near-infrared filters on JWST/NIRCam, Euclid/NISP, Roman/WFI, HST, and ground-based $izY+IJHK_S$, for a total of 105 unique filter combinations. Additionally, we apply these transformations to predict the color-magnitude relation of the tip of the red giant branch as seen with JWST, Euclid, and Roman based on theoretical results for HST and 2MASS filters; for JWST we find good agreement with empirical results in the literature. We also find typical residual dispersion around these transformations of 0.01 mag for Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables and RGB stars, but up to 0.1 mag for O- and C-rich TP-AGB stars.</description>

      <title>The Detection-vs-Retrieval Challenge: Titan as an Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), a planned third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatory, will offer significantly improved sensitivity, introducing new challenges for data analysis and computing. To prepare for these demands, the ET community has initiated a series of Mock Data Challenges (MDCs) aimed at developing and testing analysis pipelines under realistic conditions. This paper presents the first ET MDC, providing an overview of the simulated dataset and the properties of the injected GW signals, with a focus on populations of compact binary coalescences and Gaussian noise. A tutorial is also included to guide users in accessing the data and performing basic analyses. This initial challenge establishes a baseline for future MDCs and supports collaborative efforts toward the successful scientific operation of the ET.</description>

      <title>A Far-Infrared Search for Planet Nine Using AKARI All-Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An unusual orbital element clustering of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has been observed. The most promising dynamic solution is the presence of a giant planet in the outer Solar system, Planet Nine. However, due to its extreme distance, intensive searches in optical have not been successful. We aim to find Planet Nine in the far-infrared, where it has the peak of the black body radiation, using the most sensitive all-sky far-infrared survey to date, AKARI. In contrast to optical searches, where the energy of reflected sunlight decreases by $d^{4}$, thermal radiation in the infrared decreases with the square of the heliocentric distance $d^{2}$. We search for moving objects in the AKARI Single Scan Detection List. We select sources from a promising region suggested by an N-body simulation from Millholland and Laughlin 2017: $30^{\circ}&lt;$ R.A. $&lt;50^{\circ}$ and $-20^{\circ}&lt;$ Dec. $&lt;20^{\circ}$. Known sources are excluded by cross-matching AKARI sources with 9 optical and infrared catalogues. Furthermore, we select sources with small background strength to avoid sources in the cirrus. Since Planet Nine is stationary in a timescale of hours but moves on a monthly scale, our primary strategy is to select slowly moving objects that are stationary in 24 hours but not in six months, using multiple single scans by AKARI. The selected slowly moving AKARI sources are scrutinised for potential contamination from cosmic rays. Our analysis reveals two possible Planet Nine candidates whose positions and flux are within the theoretical prediction ranges. These candidates warrant further investigation through follow-up observations to confirm the existence and properties of Planet Nine.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Non-Potential Magnetic Field Parameters in a Super-Active Region with Complex Structures and Strong Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the non-potential magnetic field parameters of active region NOAA 9077 are investigated; this AR experienced a super-strong X5.7 solar flare. Using advanced extrapolation techniques, the 3D magnetic field structure from vector magnetograms is obtained from the Solar Magnetic Field Telescope (SMFT) at Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS). Then various non-potential parameters are calculated, including current density, shear angle, quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), twist, and field line helicity. By analyzing the spatial and temporal distributions of these parameters, we aim to shed light on the relationship between magnetic field properties and solar flare occurrence. Our findings reveal that high twist and complex magnetic field configurations are prevalent before flares, while these features tend to weaken after the eruption. Additionally, we observe decreases in helicity and free energy after the flare, while the free energy peaks approximately 1.5 days prior to the onset of the flare. Furthermore, we investigate the distribution of quasi-separatrix layers and twist, finding high degrees of complexity before flares. Multiple patterns of high current density regions suggest unstable magnetic structures prone to flaring, coinciding with shear angle distribution. Relative field line helicity patterns exhibit distinct characteristics compared to current density, concentrating before flares and diverging afterward. Overall, our results highlight the contrasting nature of current density and relative field line helicity patterns in relation to solar flares, in addition to the aforementioned feature in the set of commonly derived non-potential parameters for this particular event.</description>

      <title>SpaceTrack-TimeSeries: Time Series Dataset towards Satellite Orbit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.</description>

      <title>Parameter Recovery Study on IZI -- a Bayesian Analysis Tool for Emission Lines from H II Regions and Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a series of parameter recovery test results of the Bayesian analysis tool IZI, which analyses emission lines from H II regions and star-forming galaxies and returns the estimates of the gas metallicity 12 + log (O/H), ionisation parameter log q, and nebular emission-line colour excess E(B-V). We created several mock datasets using IZI to represent a few different ideal or realistic datasets and performed parameter estimation on the mock data with IZI. We found that IZI underestimated or overestimated the parameters by approximately 1-$\sigma$ or greater when the model error was included, even when using all emission lines available in the model grids. We strongly recommend that IZI users run parameter recovery tests adjusted for their data before interpreting the IZI estimates. To encourage the appropriate use of IZI, we also share a script for parameter recovery tests. The cause of IZI's biased estimation is the substantial model error in the likelihood term, which varies with the model parameters. We thus note that any parameter estimation with a substantial, varying model error in the likelihood term could return biased estimates for the model parameters, such as in the case of NebulaBayes, another Bayesian analysis tool for photoionisation emission lines. We also note two issues relevant to setting the log q prior using the observed line ratio [S III]$\lambda$$\lambda$9068,9532/[S II]$\lambda$6717,6731 (the mismatch of line flux terms and violation of Bayes' theorem) and propose a way to avoid the issues.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: $w$CDM cosmology from simulation-based inference with persistent homology on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing data using persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique that tracks how features like clusters and voids evolve across density thresholds. For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough Listen: A Technosignature Search Around 27 Eclipsing Exoplanets Selected from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we analyse the archival data for a set of 27 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Targets of Interest (TOIs) in search for artificially generated radio signals, or 'technosignatures', interrupted by occultation. Exoplanetary eclipses are notable events to observe in the search for technosignatures, as they mark the geometrical alignment of the target, its host star, and Earth. During an eclipse event, any signal emanating from the target of interest should cease for the duration of the eclipse, and resume after the line-of-sight has been restored. Target observations were made by Breakthrough Listen (BL) using Murriyang, the CSIRO Parkes 64-m radio telescope, coupled with the Ultra-wide Low frequency (UWL) receiver covering a continuous range of frequencies spanning 704-4032 MHz inclusive. Each target was observed in a pattern consisting of six back-to-back 5-minute source and reference sky positions for comparison during data analysis. We performed a Doppler search for narrowband signals with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 10, a minimum drift rate of $\pm0.1$ Hz/s, and a maximum drift rate of $\pm4.0$ Hz/s using the turboSETI pipeline. In the analysis of 1,954,880 signals, 14,639 passed automated radio interference filters where each event was presented as a set of stacked dynamic spectra. Despite manually inspecting each diagram for a signal of interest, all events were attributed to terrestrial radio frequency interference (RFI).</description>

      <title>Learned radio interferometric imaging for varying visibility coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the next generation of interferometric telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the need for highly computationally efficient reconstruction techniques is particularly acute. The challenge in designing learned, data-driven reconstruction techniques for radio interferometry is that they need to be agnostic to the varying visibility coverages of the telescope, since these are different for each observation. Because of this, learned post-processing or learned unrolled iterative reconstruction methods must typically be retrained for each specific observation, amounting to a large computational overhead. In this work we develop learned post-processing and unrolled iterative methods for varying visibility coverages, proposing training strategies to make these methods agnostic to variations in visibility coverage with minimal to no fine-tuning. Learned post-processing techniques are heavily dependent on the prior information encoded in training data and generalise poorly to other visibility coverages. In contrast, unrolled iterative methods, which include the telescope measurement operator inside the network, achieve good reconstruction quality and computation time, generalising well to other coverages and require little to no fine-tuning. Furthermore, they generalise well to more realistic radio observations and are able to reconstruct images with with a larger dynamic range than the training set.</description>

      <title>Time integration for neutrino radiation transport using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems is dominated by the interaction between matter and radiation such as photons or neutrinos. The dynamics can be described by the evolution equations of radiation hydrodynamics in which reactions between matter particles and radiation quanta couples the hydrodynamic equations to those of radiative transfer (see Munier &amp; Weaver (1986a) and Munier &amp; Weaver (1986b)). The numerical treatment has to account for their potential stiffness (e.g., in optically thick environments). In this article, we will present a new method to numerically integrate these equations in a stable way by using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. With these methods, the inversion of the implicit operator can be done analytically, so the computational cost is equivalent to that of an explicit method. We strongly take into account the physical behavior of the evolved variables in the limit of the stiff regime in the derivation of the methods. We will show the results of applying these methods to the reactions between neutrinos and matter in some tests and also in realistic core-collapse supernovae simulations.</description>

      <title>Search for anti-quark nuggets via their interaction with the LHC beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-quark nuggets (AQNs) have been suggested to solve the dark matter (DM) and the missing antimatter problem in the universe and have been proposed as an explanation of various observations. Their size is in the {\mu}m range and their density is about equal to the nuclear density with an expected flux of about $0.4 / km^2 / year$. For the typical velocity of DM constituents ($\sim$250 km/s), the solar system bodies act as highly performing gravitational lenses. Here we assume that DM streams or clusters are impinging, e.g., on the Earth, as it was worked out for DM axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Interestingly, in the LHC beam, unforeseen beam losses are triggered by so-called Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs), which are believed to be constituted of dust particles with a size in the {\mu}m range and a density of several orders of magnitude lower than AQNs. Prezeau suggested that streaming DM constituents incident on the Earth should result in jet-like structures ("hairs") exiting the Earth, or a kind of caustics. Such ideas open novel directions in the search for DM. This work suggests a new analysis of the UFO results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming that they are eventually, at least partly, due to AQNs. Firstly, a reanalysis of the existing data from the 4000 beam monitors since the beginning of the LHC is proposed, arguing that dust and AQNs should behave differently. The feasibility of this idea has been discussed with CERN accelerator people and potential collaborators.</description>

      <title>Dual-comb correlation spectroscopy of thermal light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of light of thermal origin is the principal means by which humanity has learned about our world and the cosmos. In optical astronomy, in particular, direct detection of thermal photons and the resolution of their spectra have enabled discoveries of the broadest scope and impact. Such measurements, however, do not capture the phase of the thermal fields--a parameter that has proven crucial to transformative techniques in radio astronomy such as synthetic aperture imaging. Over the last 25 years, tremendous progress has occurred in laser science, notably in the phase-sensitive, broad bandwidth, high resolution, and traceable spectroscopy enabled by the optical frequency comb. In this work, we directly connect the fields of frequency comb laser spectroscopy and passive optical sensing as applied to astronomy, remote sensing, and atmospheric science. We provide fundamental sensitivity analysis of dual-comb correlation spectroscopy (DCCS), whereby broadband thermal light is measured via interferometry with two optical frequency combs. We define and experimentally verify the sensitivity scaling of DCCS at black body temperatures relevant for astrophysical observations. Moreover, we provide comparison with direct detection techniques and more conventional laser heterodyne radiometry. Our work provides the foundation for future exploration of comb-based broadband synthetic aperture hyperspectral imaging across the infrared and optical spectrum.</description>

      <title>Markov Walk Exploration of Model Spaces: Bayesian Selection of Dark Energy Models with Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Central to model selection is a trade-off between performing a good fit and low model complexity: A model of higher complexity should only be favoured over a simpler model if it provides significantly better fits. In Bayesian terms, this can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices between two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing Markovian random walks for exploring the entire model space. In analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in parameter estimation problem, the process is governed by the logarithmic evidence ratio. We apply our methodology to selecting a polynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ on the basis of data for the supernova distance-redshift relation.</description>

      <title>A statistical study of lopsided galaxies using random forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lopsided galaxies are late-type galaxies with a non-axisymmetric disk due to an uneven distribution of their stellar mass. Despite being a relatively common perturbation, several questions regarding its origin and the information that can be extracted from them about the evolutionary history of late-type galaxies. The advent of several large multi-band photometric surveys will allow us to statistically analyze this perturbation, with information that was not previously available. Given the strong correlation between lopsidedness and the structural properties of the galaxies, this paper aims to develop a method to automatically classify late-type galaxies between lopsided and symmetric. We seek to explore if an accurate classification can be obtain by only considering their internal properties, without additional information about the environment. We select 8000 late-type galaxies from TNG50. A Fourier decomposition of their stellar mass surface density is used to label galaxies as lopsided and symmetric. We trained a Random Forest classifier to rapidly and automatically identify this type of perturbations, exclusively using galaxies internal properties. We test different algorithms to deal with the imbalance of our data and select the most suitable approach based on the considered metrics. We show that our trained algorithm can provide a very accurate and rapid classification of lopsided galaxies. The excellent results obtained by our classifier strongly supports the hypothesis that lopsidedness is mainly a tracer of galaxies internal structures. We show that similar results can be obtained using observable quantities, readily obtainable from multi-bad photometric surveys. Our results show it allows a rapid and accurate classification of lopsided galaxies, allowing us to explore whether lopsidedness in present-day disk galaxies is connected to galaxies specific evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter, and the science potential will be greatly enhanced by the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, which are expected to detect BNS signals with order-of-magnitude improvements in duration, detection rates, and signal strength. However, the resulting computational demands for analyzing such prolonged signals pose a critical challenge that existing Bayesian methods cannot feasibly address in the 3G era. To bridge this critical gap, we demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compression of the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inference that can deliver results in seconds. The optimized computational cost of BNS signal analysis with our framework shows that machine learning has the potential to be an indispensable tool for future catalog-level BNS analyses, paving the way for large-scale investigations of BNS-related physics across the 3G observational landscape.</description>

      <title>Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.</description>
