      <title>Maximum Information Extraction From Noisy Data Via Shannon Entropy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granting maximum information extraction in the analysis of noisy data is non-trivial. We introduce a general, data-driven approach that employs Shannon entropy as a transferable metric to quantify the maximum information extractable from noisy data via their clustering into statistically-relevant micro-domains. We demonstrate the method's efficiency by analyzing, as a representative example, time-series data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations of water and ice coexisting at the solid/liquid transition temperature. The method allows quantifying the information contained in the data distributions (time-independent component) and the additional information gain attainable by analyzing data as time-series (i.e., accounting for the information contained in data time-correlations). The approach is also highly effective for high-dimensional datasets, providing clear demonstrations of how considering components/data that may be little informative but noisy may be not only useless but even detrimental to maximum information extraction. This provides a general and robust parameter-free approach and quantitative metrics for data-analysis, and for the study of any type of system from its data.</description>

      <title>Fair coins tend to land on the same side they started: Evidence from 350,757 flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04153v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. We collected $350{,}757$ coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery (DHM; 2007). The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started -- DHM estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51\%. Our data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, $\text{Pr}(\text{same side}) = 0.508$, 95\% credible interval (CI) [$0.506$, $0.509$], $\text{BF}_{\text{same-side bias}} = 2359$. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin -- with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally likely to land heads or tails: $\text{Pr}(\text{heads}) = 0.500$, 95\% CI [$0.498$, $0.502$], $\text{BF}_{\text{heads-tails bias}} = 0.182$. Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Additional analyses revealed that the within-people same-side bias decreased as more coins were flipped, an effect that is consistent with the possibility that practice makes people flip coins in a less wobbly fashion. Our data therefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started.</description>

      <title>A Dataset of the Representatives Elected in France During the Fifth Republic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electoral system is a cornerstone of democracy, shaping the structure of political competition, representation, and accountability. In the case of France, it is difficult to access data describing elected representatives, though, as they are scattered across a number of sources, including public institutions, but also academic and individual efforts. This article presents a unified relational database that aims at tackling this issue by gathering information regarding representatives elected in France over the whole Fifth Republic (1958-present). This database constitutes an unprecedented resource for analyzing the evolution of political representation in France, exploring trends in party system dynamics, gender equality, and the professionalization of politics. By providing a longitudinal view of French elected representatives, the database facilitates research on the institutional stability of the Fifth Republic, offering insights into the factors of political change.</description>
