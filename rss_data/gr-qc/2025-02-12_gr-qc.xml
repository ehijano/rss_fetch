      <title>Acceleration-induced radiation from a qudit particle detector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We nonperturbatively examine the emission rate of acceleration-induced radiation from a uniformly accelerated gapless qudit-type Unruh-DeWitt detector. We find that the emission rate can be written as Larmor's formula multiplied by a factor that depends on the detector's initial state. In particular, certain initial states of integer-spin detectors do not produce radiation. Although the appearance of Larmor's formula may suggest a classical phenomenon, we argue that the resulting radiation is fundamentally distinct from that of structureless classical sources, as it evolves into a multimode coherent state correlated with the detector's internal degree of freedom. Thus, gapless detectors cannot be treated as structureless sources, as previously proposed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spacetime Leaps: Higher Dimensional Energetic Causal Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a 2+1d simulation of Energetic Causal Sets (ECS). These are a class of Causal Sets where the agency of time and its irreversibility are taken as fundamental. Events are endowed with energy-momentum conservation laws being applied at events dictating the dynamics of the Set. Unlike Causal Sets, ECS have three orders, a birth total order, a partial dynamical order which prescribes the flow of energy-momentum between events and a partial causal order that arises from the embedding of these events in Minkowski spacetime. These orders aren't necessarily in agreement with each other, something we call discausality or disordered causality. We therefore explain our first attempts at expanding to two spatial dimensions the simulations of the Energetic Causal Set model to see if we can still obtain reversible dynamics from fundamental time-irreversible laws like in the 1d case.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic dynamics of eccentric black-hole binaries in post-Newtonian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric black-hole binaries are among the most awaited sources of gravitational waves, yet their dynamics lack a consistent framework that provides a detailed and physically robust evolutionary description due to gauge issues. We present a new set of non-orbit-averaged equations, free from radiation-reaction gauge ambiguities, that accurately describe the evolution of orbital elements for eccentric, non-spinning black-hole binaries. We derive these equations by mapping the Keplerian orbital elements to a new set of characteristic parameters using energy and angular momentum definitions combined with near-identity transformations. The resulting framework is valid for arbitrary eccentricities, including parabolic and hyperbolic limits. Using this framework, we demonstrate the strictly observable effects of the non-adiabatic emission of gravitational waves -- characteristic of eccentric binaries -- on the orbital parameters. Furthermore, we assess the regime of validity of the widely used orbit-averaged equations first derived by Peters in 1964. Importantly, their breakdown becomes evident at the first pericenter passage, implying that the validity of the orbit-averaged approximation cannot be inferred solely from binary initial conditions. The formalism we introduce, accurate up to 2.5 post-Newtonian order, aims to provide a robust tool for making reliable astrophysical predictions and accurately interpreting current and future gravitational wave data, paving the way for deeper insights into the dynamics of eccentric black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Wormholes that meet the Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the latest predictions of Einstein's theory is the existence of Wormholes (WH). In this work, we present exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations representing traversable Wormholes. These solutions satisfy the energy conditions and have a ring singularity satisfying the cosmic censorship of WHs, i.e. we show that, as in previous solutions, geodesics cannot touch the singularity. We find that the most optimal input regions for the first class of solutions traversing these wormholes are near the poles and near the equatorial plane for the second class. We also find that the solution associated with the first class is physically feasible, while for the second class it presents the problem of not being asymptotically flat when considering a dilatonic-type scalar field. Finally, we give examples of realistic astrophysical objects that could fulfill these conditions.</description>

      <title>Scalar Instabilities Inside The Extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole: Novel Exact Solutions and Chronology Protection Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of test scalar fields in the region inside the extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole (DKSBH) horizon, where closed timelike curves exist. We successfully find and present the novel exact solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in the extremal DKSBH spacetime in terms of the Double Confluent Heun functions. The spacetime stability is explored by investigating the scalar's quasiresonance~(QS) frequencies obtained from polynomial condition of the Double Confluent Heun function. We found that both massive and massless scalar quasiresonances are double branched, having purely positive and negative imaginary frequencies, therefore, do not propagate, prohibiting time travel and suggesting no violation of Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC). However, only the positive branch with $0\leq\Omega_0&lt;2(n+1)$ and negative branch with $\Omega_0&gt;2(n+1)$ that grow exponentially has the ability to destroy spacetime. Remarkably, a new mass scale $M_{p}^{2}/M$, where $M$ is the black hole mass, is found to play a crucial role. The QS zeroth modes flip sign between purely damping and purely growing when the scalar mass is at this mass scale.</description>

      <title>The Weinberg no-go theorem for cosmological constant and nonlocal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent the Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant, which forbids the existence of any solution to the cosmological constant problem within the context of local field theories unless some fine-tuning is assumed. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmological constant as a nonlocal gravitational effect on very large scales. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields.</description>

      <title>Yukawa coupling, and inflationary correlation functions for a spectator scalar via stochastic spectral expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic spectator scalar field coupled to fermion via the Yukawa interaction, in the inflationary de Sitter background. We consider the fermion to be massless, and take the one loop effective potential found earlier by using the exact fermion propagator in de Sitter spacetime. We take the potential for the spectator scalar to be quintessence-like, $V(\phi)=\alpha |\phi|^p$ ($\alpha \ensuremath{&gt;} 0,\ p\ensuremath{&gt;} 4$), so that the total effective potential is generically bounded from below for all values of the parameters and couplings, and a late time equilibrium state is allowed. Using next the stochastic spectral expansion method, we numerically investigate the two point correlation function, as well as the density fluctuations corresponding to the spectator field, with respect to the three parameters of the total effective potential, $\alpha,\ p$ and the Yukawa coupling, $g$. In particular, we find that the power spectrum and the spectral index corresponds to blue tilt with increasing $g$. The three point correlation function and non-Gaussianity corresponding to the density fluctuation has also been investigated. The increasing Yukawa coupling is shown to flatten the peak of the shape function in the squeezed limit. Also in this limit, the increase in the same is shown to increase the local non-Gaussianity parameter.</description>

      <title>Modified theories of gravity at different curvature scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) remains the cornerstone of gravitational physics, providing remarkable success in describing a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. However, several challenges underscore the urgent need to explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum mechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark energy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole singularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized perspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the principles of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three broad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or parity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of GR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for understanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the current and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including those probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and EEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address critical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics. These include their potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe, the nature of dark matter, and deviations in black hole dynamics from GR predictions. This review aims to provide a structured understanding of modified gravity theories and their observational implications in the multimessenger era by focusing on the principles preserved or violated.

      <title>Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertia of a particle is due to its mass as well as intrinsic spin. The latter is revealed via the coupling of intrinsic spin with rotation. The spin-rotation coupling and the concomitant spin-gravity coupling are discussed in connection with the nature of inertia. The spin-rotation-gravity coupling leads to a gravitomagnetic Stern-Gerlach type of force on the particle that is independent of the particle's mass and thus violates the universality of free fall. This effect is extremely small and its measurement is far beyond present capabilities.</description>

      <title>Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring evidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental dark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting signatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal that, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave function of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy levels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees of freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and Kaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system and eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified gravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future. Numerical estimates for the graviton mass are also provided, and potential imprints on gravitational waves are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Influences of accretion flow and dilaton charge on the images of Einstein-Maxwell-dilation black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristics and images of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) black holes are examined in this paper, focusing on their effective potential, photon trajectories, and images with thin and thick accretion disks. We found that the shadow and photon sphere radii decrease with increasing dilaton charge. As the observation inclination increases, direct and secondary images become separate, with the direct image appearing hat-shaped. Simulations indicate that the brightness of the shadow and photon ring is higher in static spherical accretion flows compared to infalling ones. The study also shows that in thin disk accretion flows, the direct emission predominantly influences observed luminosity, with photon ring emission being less significant. Additionally, the appearance of black hole images varies with the observer's inclination angle.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate extension of Penrose's Spin Geometry Theorem is given. It is shown how the \emph{local} geometry of any \emph{curved} Lorentzian 4-manifold (with $C^2$ metric) can be derived in the classical limit using only the observables in the algebraic formulation of abstract Poincar\'e-invariant elementary quantum mechanical systems. In particular, for any point $q$ of the classical spacetime manifold and curvature tensor there, there exists a composite system built from finitely many Poincar\'e-invariant elementary quantum mechanical systems and a sequence of its states, defining the classical limit, such that, in this limit, the value of the distance observables in these states tends with asymptotically vanishing uncertainty to lengths of spacelike geodesic segments in a convex normal neighbourhood $U$ of $q$ that determine the components of the curvature tensor at $q$. Since the curvature at $q$ determines the metric on $U$ up to third order corrections, the metric structure of curved $C^2$ Lorentzian 4-manifolds is recovered from (or, alternatively, can be \emph{defined} by the observables of) abstract Poincar\'e-invariant quantum mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Limits on the existence of totally reflective exotic compact objects with current and future gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic compact objects (ECOs) are a theorized class of compact objects that solve the paradoxes of black holes by replacing the event horizon with a physical surface located at $r=r_+(1+\epsilon)$ from the would-be horizon at $r_+$. Spinning horizonless objects are prone to the ergoregion instability, which would prevent their existence if their spin is higher than a critical threshold. In this paper, we set upper limits on the existence of a population of merging ECOs from the spin distribution of the population of compact binary coalescences (CBCs) detected by the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA collaboration. Using spin measurements from 104 compact objects, we find that if ECOs have $\epsilon \in [10^{-42}-10^{-3}]$ and their surface is totally reflective, the population of CBCs cannot be composed (at 90% credible level) by more than 71% (59%) of ECOs for polar (axial) perturbations. If we restrict the ECOs to be ultracompact ($\epsilon&lt;10^{-30}$), at 90% credible level, ECOs cannot compose more than 28% and 25% of the CBC population for polar and axial perturbations. The constraints from current data are a factor of two more precise than the ones obtained from a non-detection of a stochastic GW background due to spin loss. We also study how next generation gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, can constrain the ECO population. We find that 1 day of data taking would be enough to constrain the fraction of ECOs to be lower than 20% for $\epsilon \in [10^{-42}-10^{-3}]$.</description>

      <title>The one-loop effective action from the coherent state path integral of loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a novel approach to combine path integral methods with Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Our approach builds upon the recently developed coherent state path integral formulation of LQG to compute the one-loop effective action. We compare this methodology with the conventional Quantum Field Theory (QFT) prescription for path integrals and extend the formalism to account for the dependence on boundary (coherent) states. This work aims to explore two aspects: to compare our results with the divergences observed in one-loop calculations of Einstein gravity testing UV-finiteness and to initiate an exploration of the IR effective properties of LQG. We compute the effective action around flat spacetime obtaining analytical and numerical results in the long and short wavelength approximations, respectively. Due to the one-loop dynamics of the LQG area, we find a divergence-free effective action. We study the propagator and the dynamical modes and derive the quantum equation of motion at one loop. We ensure consistency with the semiclassical approximation in the long wavelength limit and, beyond this approximation, analyze numerical scaling as the lattice size increases.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Approach to the Exact Solution of FRW-Type Spacetime with a Generalized Chaplygin Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Chaplygin gas model, characterized by the equation of state
  $p = - \frac{B}{\rho^{\alpha}}$, is investigated within the framework of a Robertson-Walker spacetime. The resulting field equations governing this model are highly non-linear in the scale factor, forming the central focus of this work. Previous studies have employed this equation to describe both a dust-dominated universe and an accelerating universe in two extreme cases. However, the time evolution of the scale factor between these two extremal cases remains unclear. To address this gap, we have employed a first-order approximation of the key equation and subsequently derived exact time-dependent solutions for the scale factor. The obtained solution converges to the $\Lambda$CDM model at large scale factors and exhibits the desirable feature of an acceleration flip. A detailed analysis of the flip time has been conducted, providing both analytical and graphical insights. The parameters of the model have been constrained using the Hubble-$57$ dataset. The present age of the universe has also been calculated. A comparison of the results from both the theoretical and observational approaches reveals remarkable consistency, with the theoretical graph of $H(z)$ vs. $z$ closely aligning with the best-fit graph obtained from the Hubble-$57$ dataset. Furthermore, the entire scenario has been examined within the context of the well-known Raychaudhuri equation, offering a broader perspective and comparison with previous results.</description>

      <title>Killing and homothetic initial data for general hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a collection of general identities relating the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}g$ of an arbitrary vector field $\eta$ with the tensor $\Sigma=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}\nabla$ on an abstract hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ of any causal character. As an application we establish necessary conditions on $\mathcal{H}$ for the existence of a homothetic Killing vector on the spacetime where $\mathcal{H}$ is embedded. The sufficiency of these conditions is then analysed in three specific settings. For spacelike hypersurfaces, we recover the well-known homothetic KID equations [10, 13] in the language of hypersurface data. For two intersecting null hypersurfaces, we generalize a previous result [7], valid for Killings, to the homothetic case and, moreover, demonstrate that the equations can be formulated solely in terms of the initial data for the characteristic Cauchy problem, i.e., without involving a priori spacetime quantities. This puts the characteristic KID problem on equal footing with the spacelike KID problem. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of the formalism by addressing the homothetic KID problem for smooth spacelike-characteristic initial data. Other initial value problems, such as the spacelike-characteristic with corners, can be approached similarly.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Three-Field String Inflation with Perturbative Corrections: Dynamics and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an explicit string motivated example of three-field inflation in a related, yet distinct from, the recently discovered perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS). Contrary to the usual constructions, in this set up, large volume is ensured by the interplay between the effects of $\alpha^{\prime 3}$, logarithmic loop and higher derivative $F^4$ corrections. After addressing a full moduli stabilization scenario, we move on to a detailed analysis of three-field model of inflation in a canonical basis. We conduct multiple consistency checks to establish a solid foundation for our model within the framework of the underlying 4D effective field theory (EFT). Our model differs from previous setups in three key aspects: first, the interaction between subleading corrections that drive full moduli stabilization follows a different pattern, second, the volume form of the underlying Calabi-Yau is different, and third, in our three-field inflation scenario, the second slow-roll parameter consistently dominates over the first by several orders of magnitude. The latter signals the possible presence of primordial features which can be verified by forthcoming ground and space based experiments. We can roughly distinguish two stages of inflation: the first stage mostly occurs in the steepest direction during horizon crossing giving us almost $55$ efolds of inflation-- once one of the inflatons falls off the ridge and then to its true minimum, the other two fields become active, giving us a truly multi-field behavior in the second stage -- adding few more efodls of inflation. We also confirm our claim by introducing the non-planar torsion in the inflationary trajectory -- this quantity becomes non-trivial in the second stage of inflation. Finally, we calculate the cosmological observables, which align with Planck data, and discuss potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in dense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~5 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to form quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a metastable transition between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars with event horizons, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we reported the presence of a new resonance of an incompressible star orbiting a spinning black hole and showed that it can set in before the tidal disruption limit if the star has an inclined spherical orbit around the black hole. Using the affine model developed by Carter and Luminet, we extend our result to the stars with polytropic equations of state. We give further credence to the result previously given. We also derive the formula for the growth rate of the resonant motion, which is useful for checking the results of hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Neutron star evolution by combining discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here a new hybrid scheme that combines a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with finite volume (FV) and finite difference (FD) methods. The computational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not overlap. Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information exchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for ghostzones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations. Furthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that require information exchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on non-cuboid meshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element and its six nearest neighbors. Through this reduction in communication, we aim to retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. The goal is to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the more robust FV/FD method in elements that contain non-smooth shocks or star surfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element should be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and test the new scheme. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases. These include the challenging cases of a neutron star initially in an unstable equilibrium migrating to a stable configuration and a boosted neutron star. These cases are simulated for the first time here in full 3D with general relativistic hydrodynamics using DG methods. We also describe additional numerical methods, such as the limiters and the atmosphere treatment we need for our simulations.</description>

Abstract: The inspiral range is the most common metric for characterizing the performance of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers. However, there is no clear formalism for working with frequency-dependent inspiral range quantities. We introduce a metric for the cumulative normalized range of a gravitational-wave interferometer, as well as methods to compare two separate noise curves. We show how this metric is a valuable tool for guiding the commissioning of these interferometers and provides increased clarity compared to other commonly used approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way, to suppress the coupling of scattered light in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how Tunable Coherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam, which is an issue particularly in ring resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrary to conformal transformations, disformal transformations can change the principal null directions of a spacetime geometry. Thus, depending on the frame a gravitational wave (GW) detector minimally couples to, the properties of GWs may change under a disformal transformation. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions which determine whether GWs change under disformal transformations or not. Our argument is coordinate-independent and can be applied to any spacetime geometry at the fully non-linear level. As an example, we show that an exact radiative solution of massless Einstein-scalar gravity which admits only shear-free parallel transported frame is mapped to a disformed geometry which does not possess any shear-free parallel transported frame. This radiative geometry and its disformed counterpart provide a concrete example of the possibility to generate tensorial GWs from a disformal transformation at the fully non-linear level. This type of non-linear effect can be completely overlooked in the usual linear perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the conformally coupled scalar gravitational theory. This is the simplest local-scale invariant theory of gravity which is linear in the curvature scalar. We demonstrate that, if incorporate local-scale symmetry into the variational procedure, it is not required that the trace of the stress-energy tensor of the matter fields vanished for this symmetry to be preserved. The relevance of this result for the understanding of local-scale symmetry along with its physical consequences, is discussed.</description>

Abstract: To investigate the model and extra frictional effects in standard siren simulation of $f(Q)$ cosmologies, we simulated three types of standard siren data based on different fiducial models ($\Lambda$CDM and $f(Q)$ models). Both effects are important in standard siren simulation. Explicitly, the $f(Q)_P$ and $f(Q)_E$ models need more observational data (e.g.growth factor) to further study. The $f(Q)_{PE}$ model could be ruled out by the EM data. And both the $f(Q)_{HT}$ models will be excluded by the future standard siren data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a quantization of the Schwarzschild spacetime in the presence of a cosmological constant, based on midisuperspace methods developed in the spherically symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity, using in particular the 'improved dynamics' scheme. We include both the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter cases. We find that the quantization puts a Planckian positive upper limit on the possible values of the cosmological constant similar to the bounds obtained earlier from studies of homogeneous spacetimes. This means that, for negative cosmological constant, no negative bound is found. Moreover, using semiclassical physical states, we obtain the effective metric and demonstrate the causal structure for various cases. Quantum gravity modifications ensure that the singularity is replaced by a transition surface in all the cases, where the curvature invariants approach mass-independent Planckian bounds. Analysis of the effective stress-energy tensor shows that the null energy condition is strongly violated in the vicinity of the transition surface. Moreover, it shows a weaker asymptotic fall off for a nonvanishing cosmological constant, which could have interesting phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chronology Protection Conjecture in The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC) was first introduced by Hawking after his semi-classical investigation to the behaviour of a spacetime with closed timelike curves (CTCs) in response to scalar perturbation. It is argued that there would be instabilities leading to amplification of the perturbation and finally causing collapse of the region with CTCs. In this work, we investigate the CPC by exactly solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the region inside the inner horizon of the non-extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen~(KS) black hole, where closed timelike curves exist. Successfully find the exact radial solution, we apply the polynomial condition that turns into rule of the energy quantization. The quasinormal modes~(QNMs) of the scalar fields in the region inside the inner horizon of the rotating black hole with nonzero energy have only positive imaginary part describing states that grow in time. The exponentially growing modes will backreact and deform the spacetime region where CTC exists. The CPC is proven to be valid in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime. Moreover, since the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole is the most general axisymmetric black hole solution of the string inspired Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, the semiclassical proof in this work is also valid for all simpler rotating black holes of the EMDA theory. The structure of the Dyonic KS spacetime distinctive from the Kerr-Newman counterpart is also explored.</description>

Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cauchy-characteristic evolution (CCE) is a powerful method for accurately extracting gravitational waves at future null infinity. In this work, we extend the previously implemented CCE system within the numerical relativity code SpECTRE by incorporating a scalar field. This allows the system to capture features of beyond-general-relativity theories. We derive scalar contributions to the equations of motion, Weyl scalar computations, Bianchi identities, and balance laws at future null infinity. Our algorithm, tested across various scenarios, accurately reveals memory effects induced by both scalar and tensor fields and captures Price's power-law tail ($u^{-l-2}$) in scalar fields at future null infinity, in contrast to the $t^{-2l-3}$ tail at future timelike infinity.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of gravitational atoms</title>

Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields can form condensates, or clouds, around spinning black holes. When this system is under the influence of a secondary massive body, its tidal response can be quantified in the tidal Love numbers (TLNs). Although TLNs vanish for black holes in vacuum, it has been shown that the same is not true for black holes immersed in matter environments. In this work, we compute the gravitational TLNs of black holes surrounded by scalar clouds, in the Newtonian limit. We show that they are non-vanishing, have a strong power-law dependence on the boson's mass, and are proportional to the scalar cloud's total mass. In particular, we find that, independently of the cloud's configuration, the TLNs from axisymmetric tides scale as $\propto r_c^{2l+1}$, for $r_c$ the cloud's "radius" and $l$ the multipole order of the external tidal field. This differs by a factor $r_c$ from previous estimates based on scalar and vector tidal perturbations but is in perfect agreement with the behavior of TLNs in other matter systems. Furthermore, we show that the adiabatic tides approximation we employ is, in general, not appropriate for non-axisymmetric tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>Testing screened scalar-tensor theories of gravity with atomic clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any scalar-tensor theory of gravity exhibiting a screening mechanism, the fifth force mediated by the scalar field is dynamically suppressed at sub-Solar system scales, allowing it to pass existing tests of gravity. As a result, a major research effort has been carried out over the past decades to `outsmart' screened scalars in this game of hide-and-seek. While most of such tests rely on fifth force effects, one should keep in mind that the latter are by no means the only physical feature of scalar-tensor gravity. In particular, this article investigates the possibility of testing screened scalar-tensor models by means of gravitational redshift measurements performed with atomic clocks. Upon deriving the expression for the redshift in this framework, we propose a thought experiment for testing the chameleon model by clock comparisons, which guides us towards more realistic experimental setups, in the laboratory and in space. We find that currently unconstrained regions of the chameleon parameter space could be ruled out by future redshift experiments.</description>

      <title>Running Hubble constant: evolutionary Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss an evolutionary dark energy model, based on the presence of non-equilibrium effects on the dark energy constituents, which are described via a bulk viscosity contribution. We implement the proposed dynamics by the analysis of the 40-bins Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) Pantheon sample data, in order to outline the existence of a running Hubble constant with the redshift. Via a fitting procedure, we determine the value of the additional parameter that our model possesses with respect a standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. As important result, the evolutionary dark energy proposal seems more appropriate to describe the binned SN analysis with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM Hubble parameter, i.e. a non running value for the Hubble constant over the bins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the canonical analysis of different versions of unimodular gravity defined in the Pleba\'nski formalism, based on a (generally complex) SO(3) spin connection and set of (self-dual) two-forms. As in the metric formulation of unimodular gravity, one can study either a theory with fixed volume form or work in a parametrised formalism in which the cosmological constant becomes a dynamical field, constrained to be constant by the field equations. In the first case, the Hamiltonian density contains a part which is not constrained to vanish, but rather constrained to be constant, again as in the metric formulation. We also discuss reality conditions and challenges in extracting Lorentzian solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector, coupled linearly to a massless scalar quantum field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, as a probe of the interior of a black hole. Specifically, we consider the transition rate of a detector in the spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole as it freely falls toward and across the horizon and compare it to the corresponding situation for an $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon. Both the BTZ black hole and its geon counterpart are quotients of $\text{AdS}_3$ spacetime that are identical exterior to the horizon but have different interior topologies. We find outside the horizon that the rates are qualitatively similar, but with the amplitude in the geon spacetime larger than in the BTZ case. Once the detector crosses the horizon, there are notable distinctions characterized by different discontinuities in the temporal derivative of the response rate. These discontinuities can appear outside the horizon if the detector is switched on at a sufficiently early time, within the past white hole horizon. In general, the detector can act as an `early warning system' that both spots the black hole horizon and discerns its interior topology.</description>

      <title>Curvature equations coupling symmetric tensors with a metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are described hierarchies of equations coupling a metric with a trace-free tensor having prescribed symmetries and in the kernel of certain generalized gradients. These specialize, when the tensor vanishes identically, to the usual hierarchy of constant sectional curvature (projectively flat), Einstein, and constant scalar curvature. At the Ricci curvature level these equations are formal analogues of the Einstein-Maxwell and supergravity equations that couple differential forms with a metric. The particular cases coupling a metric with trace-free symmetric tensors satisfying the Codazzi or conformal Killing equations are studied in detail. Examples of solutions are obtained from mean curvature zero immersions, affine spheres, isoparametric hypersurfaces, and related algebraic constructions. The formalism yields a hierarchy of curvature equations for statistical structures. There are deduced constraints on the scalar curvature of the metric occurring in a solution that generalize classical results of Simons, for mean curvature zero hypersurfaces in spheres, and of Calabi, for hyperbolic affine spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AsterX, a novel open-source, modular, GPU-accelerated, fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code designed for dynamic spacetimes in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and tailored for exascale computing. We utilize block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) through CarpetX, the new driver for the Einstein Toolkit, which is built on AMReX, a software framework for massively parallel applications. AsterX employs the Valencia formulation for GRMHD, coupled with the Z4c formalism for spacetime evolution, while incorporating high resolution shock capturing schemes to accurately handle the hydrodynamics. AsterX has undergone rigorous testing in both static and dynamic spacetime, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and agreement with other codes in literature. Using subcycling in time, we find an overall performance gain of factor 2.5 to 4.5. Benchmarking the code through scaling tests on OLCF's Frontier supercomputer, we demonstrate a weak scaling efficiency of about 67%-77% on 4096 nodes compared to an 8-node performance.</description>

      <title>Structure of Massive Gauge/Gravity Scattering Amplitudes, Equivalence Theorems, and Extended Double-Copy with Compactified Warped Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the compactified 5-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. We present systematic formulations of the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) for warped KK theories in $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, where the GAET connects the scattering amplitudes of longitudinal KK gauge bosons to that of the corresponding KK Goldstone bosons and the GRET connects the scattering amplitudes of KK gravitons of helicity-zero (helicity-one) to that of the corresponding gravitational scalar (vector) KK Goldstone bosons. We analyze the structure of 3-point and 4-point scattering amplitudes of massive KK gauge bosons and of massive KK gravitons as well as their corresponding Goldstone bosons. We first prove the GAET and GRET explicitly for the fundamental 3-point KK gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes. We then demonstrate that the validity of the GAET and GRET for 4-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes can be reduced to the validity of GAET and GRET for 3-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level. With these, we study the double-copy construction of KK scattering amplitudes in the warped gauge/gravity theories. We newly realize the double-copy for massive 3-point full gauge/gravity amplitudes at tree level under proper correspondences of color-kinematics and of gauge/gravity couplings, whereas we can construct the double-copy for 4-point KK gauge/gravity amplitudes to the leading order (LO) of high energy expansion. We also conjecture that this LO double-copy construction can be extended to $N$-point scattering amplitudes with $N\!\geqslant 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the concept of bulk reconstruction, which involves mapping bulk operators into CFT operators to understand the emergence of spacetime and gravity. We argue that the $N=\infty$ approximation fails to capture crucial aspects of gravity, as it does not respect gauge invariance and lacks direct connections between energy and boundary metrics. Key concepts such as entanglement wedge reconstruction and holographic error correction codes, which are based on the $N=\infty$ theory, may be incorrect or require significant revision when finite $N$ effects are considered. We present explicit examples demonstrating discrepancies in bulk reconstructions and suggest that a gauge-invariant approach is necessary for an accurate understanding.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

Abstract: We use digital quantum computing to simulate the creation of particles in a dynamic spacetime. We consider a system consisting of a minimally coupled massive quantum scalar field in a spacetime undergoing homogeneous and isotropic expansion, transitioning from one stationary state to another through a brief inflationary period. We simulate two vibration modes, positive and negative for a given field momentum, by devising a quantum circuit that implements the time evolution. With this circuit, we study the number of particles created after the universe expands at a given rate, both by simulating the circuit and by actual experimental implementation on IBM quantum computers, consisting of hundreds of quantum gates. We find that state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques are useful to improve the estimation of the number of particles and the fidelity of the state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Not Quite Killing It: Black Hole Evaporation, Global Energy, and De-Idealization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of arguments for black hole evaporation relies on conservation laws, defined through symmetries represented by Killing vector fields which exist globally or asymptotically. However, these symmetries often rely on the idealizations of stationarity and asymptotic flatness, respectively. In non-stationary or non-asymptotically-flat spacetimes where realistic black holes evaporate, the requisite Killing fields typically do not exist. Can we 'de-idealize' these idealizations, and subsequently the associated arguments for black hole evaporation? Here, I critically examine the strategy of using 'approximately Killing' fields to de-idealize black hole spacetimes and approximately extend conservation laws to non-idealized cases. I argue that this approach encounters significant challenges, undermining the use of these idealizations to justify the evaporation of realistic -- rather than idealized -- black holes, and raising questions about the justified use of such idealizations.</description>
