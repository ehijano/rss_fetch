      <title>MRI-CORE: A Foundation Model for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000 MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only 10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in MRI such as classification of image properties including body location, sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many applications.</description>

      <title>ICME 2025 Grand Challenge on Video Super-Resolution for Video Conferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-, bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration. This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor, providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks: general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.</description>

      <title>SUSEP-Net: Simulation-Supervised and Contrastive Learning-based Deep Neural Networks for Susceptibility Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) provides a valuable tool for quantifying susceptibility distributions in human brains; however, two types of opposing susceptibility sources (i.e., paramagnetic and diamagnetic), may coexist in a single voxel, and cancel each other out in net QSM images. Susceptibility source separation techniques enable the extraction of sub-voxel information from QSM maps. This study proposes a novel SUSEP-Net for susceptibility source separation by training a dual-branch U-net with a simulation-supervised training strategy. In addition, a contrastive learning framework is included to explicitly impose similarity-based constraints between the branch-specific guidance features in specially-designed encoders and the latent features in the decoders. Comprehensive experiments were carried out on both simulated and in vivo data, including healthy subjects and patients with pathological conditions, to compare SUSEP-Net with three state-of-the-art susceptibility source separation methods (i.e., APART-QSM, \c{hi}-separation, and \c{hi}-sepnet). SUSEP-Net consistently showed improved results compared with the other three methods, with better numerical metrics, improved high-intensity hemorrhage and calcification lesion contrasts, and reduced artifacts in brains with pathological conditions. In addition, experiments on an agarose gel phantom data were conducted to validate the accuracy and the generalization capability of SUSEP-Net.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Driven Compression for Low-Bitrate Talking Head Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talking head video compression has advanced with neural rendering and keypoint-based methods, but challenges remain, especially at low bit rates, including handling large head movements, suboptimal lip synchronization, and distorted facial reconstructions. To address these problems, we propose a novel audio-visual driven video codec that integrates compact 3D motion features and audio signals. This approach robustly models significant head rotations and aligns lip movements with speech, improving both compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. Experiments on the CelebV-HQ dataset show that our method reduces bitrate by 22% compared to VVC and by 8.5% over state-of-the-art learning-based codec. Furthermore, it provides superior lip-sync accuracy and visual fidelity at comparable bitrates, highlighting its effectiveness in bandwidth-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>UAV Object Detection and Positioning in a Mining Industrial Metaverse with Custom Geo-Referenced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mining sector increasingly adopts digital tools to improve operational efficiency, safety, and data-driven decision-making. One of the key challenges remains the reliable acquisition of high-resolution, geo-referenced spatial information to support core activities such as extraction planning and on-site monitoring. This work presents an integrated system architecture that combines UAV-based sensing, LiDAR terrain modeling, and deep learning-based object detection to generate spatially accurate information for open-pit mining environments. The proposed pipeline includes geo-referencing, 3D reconstruction, and object localization, enabling structured spatial outputs to be integrated into an industrial digital twin platform. Unlike traditional static surveying methods, the system offers higher coverage and automation potential, with modular components suitable for deployment in real-world industrial contexts. While the current implementation operates in post-flight batch mode, it lays the foundation for real-time extensions. The system contributes to the development of AI-enhanced remote sensing in mining by demonstrating a scalable and field-validated geospatial data workflow that supports situational awareness and infrastructure safety.</description>

      <title>MultiViT2: A Data-augmented Multimodal Neuroimaging Prediction Framework via Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging integrates diverse data types, such as structural and functional neuroimaging, to provide complementary insights that enhance deep learning predictions and improve outcomes. This study focuses on a neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model, \textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally, we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and demonstrates strong scalability and portability.</description>

      <title>Robust Recursive Fusion of Multiresolution Multispectral Images with Location-Aware Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiresolution image fusion is a key problem for real-time satellite imaging and plays a central role in detecting and monitoring natural phenomena such as floods. It aims to solve the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution in remote sensing instruments. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this problem, the presence of outliers such as clouds downgrades their performance. Moreover, strategies that integrate robustness, recursive operation and learned models are missing. In this paper, a robust recursive image fusion framework leveraging location-aware neural networks (NN) to model the image dynamics is proposed. Outliers are modeled by representing the probability of contamination of a given pixel and band. A NN model trained on a small dataset provides accurate predictions of the stochastic image time evolution, which improves both the accuracy and robustness of the method. A recursive solution is proposed to estimate the high-resolution images using a Bayesian variational inference framework. Experiments fusing images from the Landsat 8 and MODIS instruments show that the proposed approach is significantly more robust against cloud cover, without losing performance when no clouds are present.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Gaze Refinement for Micro-Expression Recognition: Enhancing Event-Based Eye Tracking with Motion-Aware Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Occlusions in the Wild: A Multi-Task Age Head Approach to Age Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial age estimation has achieved considerable success under controlled conditions. However, in unconstrained real-world scenarios, which are often referred to as 'in the wild', age estimation remains challenging, especially when faces are partially occluded, which may obscure their visibility. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach integrating generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer architectures to enable robust age estimation from occluded faces. We employ an SN-Patch GAN to effectively remove occlusions, while an Attentive Residual Convolution Module (ARCM), paired with a Swin Transformer, enhances feature representation. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-Task Age Head (MTAH) that combines regression and distribution learning, further improving age estimation under occlusion. Experimental results on the FG-NET, UTKFace, and MORPH datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques for occluded facial age estimation by achieving an MAE of $3.00$, $4.54$, and $2.53$ years, respectively.</description>

      <title>Modeling Barrett's Esophagus Progression using Geometric Variational Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection of Barrett's Esophagus (BE), the only known precursor to Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), is crucial for effectively preventing and treating esophageal cancer. In this work, we investigate the potential of geometric Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn a meaningful latent representation that captures the progression of BE. We show that hyperspherical VAE (S-VAE) and Kendall Shape VAE show improved classification accuracy, reconstruction loss, and generative capacity. Additionally, we present a novel autoencoder architecture that can generate qualitative images without the need for a variational framework while retaining the benefits of an autoencoder, such as improved stability and reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>A robust and scalable framework for hallucination detection in virtual tissue staining and digital pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential for disease diagnosis. Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.</description>

      <title>Semantic Segmentation Based Quality Control of Histopathology Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a software pipeline for quality control (QC) of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) that segments various regions, such as blurs of different levels, tissue regions, tissue folds, and pen marks. Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed DeepCT: Sinogram Wavelet Decomposition Meets Masked Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion model shows remarkable potential on sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction. However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization in MRI-Based Deep Learning Models for Total Knee Replacement Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19203v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.</description>

      <title>VIViT: Variable-Input Vision Transformer Framework for 3D MR Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised pretrain techniques have been widely used to improve the downstream tasks' performance. However, real-world magnetic resonance (MR) studies usually consist of different sets of contrasts due to different acquisition protocols, which poses challenges for the current deep learning methods on large-scale pretrain and different downstream tasks with different input requirements, since these methods typically require a fixed set of input modalities or, contrasts. To address this challenge, we propose variable-input ViT (VIViT), a transformer-based framework designed for self-supervised pretraining and segmentation finetuning for variable contrasts in each study. With this ability, our approach can maximize the data availability in pretrain, and can transfer the learned knowledge from pretrain to downstream tasks despite variations in input requirements. We validate our method on brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN and ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively. These results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and performance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography: A Multi-Center Validation Study in Thai Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6% localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists' acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of 74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer screening workflows in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models in Medical Imaging -- A Review and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.</description>

      <title>ADAgent: LLM Agent for Alzheimer's Disease Analysis with Collaborative Coordinator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However, most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks, process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.</description>

      <title>Stochasticity-aware No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of point cloud processing algorithms necessitates an accurate assessment for their quality. Previous works consistently regard point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) as a MOS regression problem and devise a deterministic mapping, ignoring the stochasticity in generating MOS from subjective tests. This work presents the first probabilistic architecture for no-reference PCQA, motivated by the labeling process of existing datasets. The proposed method can model the quality judging stochasticity of subjects through a tailored conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and produces multiple intermediate quality ratings. These intermediate ratings simulate the judgments from different subjects and are then integrated into an accurate quality prediction, mimicking the generation process of a ground truth MOS. Specifically, our method incorporates a Prior Module, a Posterior Module, and a Quality Rating Generator, where the former two modules are introduced to model the judging stochasticity in subjective tests, while the latter is developed to generate diverse quality ratings. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach outperforms previous cutting-edge methods by a large margin and exhibits gratifying cross-dataset robustness.

      <title>Fast Point Cloud Geometry Compression with Context-based Residual Coding and INR-based Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressing a set of unordered points is far more challenging than compressing images/videos of regular sample grids, because of the difficulties in characterizing neighboring relations in an irregular layout of points. Many researchers resort to voxelization to introduce regularity, but this approach suffers from quantization loss. In this research, we use the KNN method to determine the neighborhoods of raw surface points. This gives us a means to determine the spatial context in which the latent features of 3D points are compressed by arithmetic coding. As such, the conditional probability model is adaptive to local geometry, leading to significant rate reduction. Additionally, we propose a dual-layer architecture where a non-learning base layer reconstructs the main structures of the point cloud at low complexity, while a learned refinement layer focuses on preserving fine details. This design leads to reductions in model complexity and coding latency by two orders of magnitude compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR) into the refinement layer, allowing the decoder to sample points on the underlying surface at arbitrary densities. This work is the first to effectively exploit content-aware local contexts for compressing irregular raw point clouds, achieving high rate-distortion performance, low complexity, and the ability to function as an arbitrary-scale upsampling network simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>HSRMamba: Contextual Spatial-Spectral State Space Model for Single Image Hyperspectral Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mamba has demonstrated exceptional performance in visual tasks due to its powerful global modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, offering considerable potential in hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSISR). However, in HSISR, Mamba faces challenges as transforming images into 1D sequences neglects the spatial-spectral structural relationships between locally adjacent pixels, and its performance is highly sensitive to input order, which affects the restoration of both spatial and spectral details. In this paper, we propose HSRMamba, a contextual spatial-spectral modeling state space model for HSISR, to address these issues both locally and globally. Specifically, a local spatial-spectral partitioning mechanism is designed to establish patch-wise causal relationships among adjacent pixels in 3D features, mitigating the local forgetting issue. Furthermore, a global spectral reordering strategy based on spectral similarity is employed to enhance the causal representation of similar pixels across both spatial and spectral dimensions. Finally, experimental results demonstrate our HSRMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in quantitative quality and visual results.
