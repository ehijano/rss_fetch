      <title>Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved Characterization of Meissner Screening Breakdown in Surface Treated Niobium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report direct measurements of the magnetic field screening at the limits of the Meissner phase for two superconducting Nb samples. The samples are processed with two different surface treatments that have been developed for superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications -- a "baseline" treatment and an oxygen-doping ("O-doping") treatment. The measurements show: 1) that the screening length is significantly longer in the "O-doping" sample compared to the "baseline" sample; 2) that the screening length near the limits of the Meissner phase increases with applied field; 3) the evolution of the screening profile as the material transitions from the Meissner phase to the mixed phase; and 4) a demonstration of the absence of any screening profile for the highest applied field, indicative of the full flux entering the sample. Measurements are performed utilizing the $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR) technique that allows depth resolved studies of the local magnetic field within the first 100 nm of the surface. The study takes advantage of the $\beta$-SRF beamline, a new facility at TRIUMF, Canada, where field levels up to 200 mT are available parallel to the sample surface to replicate radio frequency (RF) fields near the Meissner breakdown limits of Nb.</description>

      <title>Giant Thermoelectric Response of Fluxons in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric devices that operate on quantum principles have been under extensive investigation in the past decades. These devices are at the fundamental limits of miniaturized heat engines and refrigerators, advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics. Most research in this area concerns the use of conduction electrons and holes as charge and heat carriers, and only very recently have superconductors been considered as thermal engines and thermoelectric devices. Here, we investigate the thermoelectric response of an Abrikosov vortex in type-II superconductors in the deep quantum limit. We consider two thermoelectric geometries, a type-II SIN junction and a local Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)-tip normal metal probe over the superconductor. We exploit the strong breaking of particle-hole symmetry in bound states at sub-gap energies within the superconducting vortex to realize a giant thermoelectric response in the presence of fluxons. We predict a thermovoltage of a few mV/K at sub-Kelvin temperatures using both semi-analytic and numerical self-consistent solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Relevant thermoelectric coefficients and figures of merit are found within our model, both in linear and nonlinear regimes. The ZT of the SIN junction is around 1, rising to above 3 for the STM junction centered at the vortex core. We also discuss how this system can be used as a sensitive thermocouple, diode, or localized bolometer to detect low-energy single photons.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect in a Fibonacci quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodicity has recently been proposed to enhance superconductivity and its proximity effect. At the same time, there has been significant experimental progress in the fabrication of quasiperiodic structures, also in reduced dimensions. Motivated by these developments, we use microscopic tight-binding theory to investigate the DC Josephson effect through a ballistic Fibonacci chain attached to two superconducting leads. The Fibonacci chain is one of the most studied examples of quasicrystals, hosting a rich multifractal spectrum, containing topological gaps with different winding numbers. We study how the Andreev bound states (ABS), current-phase relation, and the critical current depend on the quasiperiodic degrees of freedom, from short to long junctions. While the current-phase relation shows a traditional $2\pi$ sinusoidal or sawtooth profile, we find that the ABS obtain quasiperiodic oscillations and that the Andreev reflection is qualitatively altered, leading to quasiperiodic oscillations in the critical current as a function of junction length. Surprisingly, despite earlier proposals of enhanced superconductivity, we do not in general find an enhanced critical current. However, we find significant enhancement for reduced interface transparency due to the modified Andreev reflection. Furthermore, by varying the chemical potential, e.g.~by an applied gate voltage, we find a fractal oscillation between superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) and superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) behavior. Finally, we show that the winding of the subgap states leads to an equivalent winding in the critical current, such that the winding numbers, and thus the topological invariant, can be determined.</description>

      <title>Role of Vanadium-Oxide Layer in Electronic State of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$ with Oxygen Deficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron-based superconductor Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_3$ is composed of alternate stacking of a superconducting FeAs layer and an insulating vanadium-oxide layer with a perovskite-type structure. Electronic orders stemming from the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of V $3d$ electrons can arise in the vanadium-oxide layer, but such orders have not been confirmed so far. Here, we systematically investigate the electronic state of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$ with oxygen deficiency and demonstrate the phase diagram of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$ as a function of the $c$-axis lattice parameter, which has turned out to be a suitable measure of the amount of oxygen deficiency. We found a magnetic and structural anomaly at $\sim 100$ K with a thermal hysteresis, which is manifested with the introduction of oxygen deficiency. The presence of orthorhombic distortion was revealed below the temperature at which the anomaly appears, suggestive of V orbital ordering involving the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. It seems that substantial fluctuations associated with the orthorhombic distortion significantly influence the electronic state of the FeAs layer. Our findings indicate that the vanadium-oxide layer plays a significant role in the electronic state of Sr$_2$VFeAsO$_{3-\delta}$.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators, featuring bulk-boundary correspondence, have been realized on a large number of noncrystalline materials, among which amorphous network, quasicrystals and fractal lattices are the most prominent ones. By contrast, topological superconductors beyond the realm of quantum crystals are yet to be harnessed, as their nucleation takes place around a well-defined Fermi surface with a Fermi momentum, the existence of which rests on the underlying translational symmetry. Here we identify a family of noncrystalline Dirac materials, devoid of time-reversal (${\mathcal T}$) and translational symmetries, on which a suitable local or on-site pairing yields topological superconductors. We showcase this outcome on all the above mentioned noncrystalline platforms embedded in a two-dimensional flat space. The resulting noncrystalline topological superconductors possess quantized topological invariants (Bott index and local Chern marker) and harbor robust one-dimensional Majorana edge modes, analogs of ${\mathcal T}$-odd $p+ip$ pairing in noncrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and magnetic impurities in Ising superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon-driven $s$-wave superconductivity is fundamentally antagonistic to uniform magnetism, and field-induced suppression of the critical temperature is one of its canonical signatures. Examples of the opposite are unique and require fortuitous cancellations and very fine parameter tuning. The recently discovered Ising superconductors violate this rule: an external magnetic field applied in a certain direction does not suppress superconductivity in an ideal, impurity-free material. We propose a simple and experimentally accessible system where the effects of spin-conserving and spin-flip scattering can be studied in a controlled way, namely NbSe$_2$ monolayers dosed with magnetic $3d$ atoms. We predict that the critical temperature is slightly increased by an in-plane magnetic field in NbSe$_2$ dosed with Cr. Due to the band spin splitting, magnetic spin-flip scattering requires a finite momentum transfer, while spin-conserving scattering does not. If the magnetic anisotropy is easy-axis, an in-plane field reorients the impurity spins and transforms spin-conserving scattering into spin-flip. The critical temperature is enhanced if the induced magnetization of NbSe$_2$ has a substantial long-range component, as is the case for Cr ions.</description>

      <title>Colossal Layer Nernst Effect in Twisted Moir\'{e} Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a theoretical analysis of the emergence of layer-contrasted Nernst response perpendicular to the direction of the temperature gradient in twisted moir\'{e} layers, called layer Nernst effect (LNE). This phenomenon arises from the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface along with a layer-contrasted pseudomagnetic field. Interestingly, the Fermi surface's warping explicitly breaks intra-valley inversion symmetry, which leads to an imbalance between left- and right-moving carriers, thus resulting in a non-vanishing LNE. We then validate our theoretical scheme by applying it to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Importantly, we find that the LNE coefficient in TBG can reach values as high as $10^3$A/(m$\cdot$K), surpassing those of previously known materials by at least one order of magnitude. These results provide a theoretical foundation for utilizing TBG and other twisted moir\'{e} layers as promising platforms to explore layer caloritronics and develop thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Conditional Generation of Hypothetical New Families of Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective computational search holds great potential for aiding the discovery of High-Temperature Superconductors (HTSs), especially given the lack of systematic methods for their discovery. Recent progress has been made in this area with machine learning, especially with deep generative models, which have been able to outperform traditional manual searches at predicting new superconductors within existing superconductor families but have yet to be able to generate completely new families of superconductors. We address this limitation by implementing conditioning -- a method to control the generation process -- for our generative model and develop SuperDiff, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR) conditioning for HTS discovery -- the first deep generative model for superconductor discovery with conditioning on reference compounds. With SuperDiff, by being able to control the generation process, we were able to computationally generate completely new families of hypothetical superconductors for the very first time. Given that SuperDiff also has relatively fast training and inference times, it has the potential to be a very powerful tool for accelerating the discovery of new superconductors and enhancing our understanding of them.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars with unconventional superconducting pairing symmetries via multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multi-body interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multi-body interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has a constant interaction energy by cancelling the two-body and multi-body interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). Particularly, the constructed eigenstates have off-site pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, which leads to superconducting states with either even-parity and spin-triplet or odd-parity and spin-singlet symmetry. We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multi-body interactions has the spin-triplet $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, entanglement entropy, and level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including spin-triplet $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice and spin-singlet $p$-wave pairing states in a one dimensional chain. These findings open up the possibility of realizing nonequilibrium unconventional superconductivity in a long-lived manner protected against thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host a hard-gapped superconductor-semiconductor interface. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in germanium are a crucial ingredient towards topological superconductivity and novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi) superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a robust critical out-of-plane field of 0.91(5) T. Finally we explore sub-gap spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.</description>

      <title>MSene: A new large family of two-dimensional transition metal sulfide with MXene structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically report a new large family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal sulfides $M$$_{2}$S with MXene structure in 2H and 1T phases, which we name as MSene. Twenty-four out of fifty-eight MSenes are proved to be stable. Notably, this family includes twelve superconducting (SC) materials, seven SC topological metals (SCTMs), four charge density wave (CDW) materials, and five magnetic materials including one ferromagnetic (FM) and four antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. For example, 2H-Mo$_{2}$S is a SCTM which exhibits SC critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 10.2 K and nontrivial topological properties; 1T-Hf$_{2}$S is a CDW material with the CDW originating from electron-phonon coupling. The CDW can be suppressed by compressive strain, leading to the emergence of superconductivity; 2H-Cr$_{2}$S and 1T-Mn$_{2}$S show FM and AFM properties, respectively. Thus, the new large family we predicted shows rich physical properties and significantly expands the repertoire of 2D materials. It serves as a novel platform for investigating the competition or coexistence of multiple orders such as SC, CDW, FM, AFM and topological orders in 2D materials.</description>
