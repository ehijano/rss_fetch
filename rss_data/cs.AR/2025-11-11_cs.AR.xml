      <title>Production-Grade Local LLM Inference on Apple Silicon: A Comparative Study of MLX, MLC-LLM, Ollama, llama.cpp, and PyTorch MPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic, empirical evaluation of five local large language model (LLM) runtimes on Apple Silicon: MLX, MLC-LLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, and PyTorch MPS. Experiments were conducted on a Mac Studio equipped with an M2 Ultra processor and 192 GB of unified memory. Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.
  Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features. llama.cpp is highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.
  All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing. Although Apple Silicon inference frameworks still trail NVIDIA GPU-based systems such as vLLM in absolute performance, they are rapidly maturing into viable, production-grade solutions for private, on-device LLM inference.</description>

      <title>iEEG Seizure Detection with a Sparse Hyperdimensional Computing Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implantable devices for reliable intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) require efficient, accurate, and real-time detection of seizures. Dense hyperdimensional computing (HDC) proves to be efficient over neural networks; however, it still consumes considerable switching power for an ultra-low energy application. Sparse HDC, on the other hand, has the potential of further reducing the energy consumption, yet at the expense of having to support more complex operations and introducing an extra hyperparameter, the maximum hypervector density. To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling. We also analyze how a proper hyperparameter choice improves the detection delay compared to dense HDC. Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation. We are also 7.50x more energy- and 3.24x more area-efficient than the dense HDC implementation. This work highlights the hardware advantages of sparse HDC, demonstrating its potential to enable smaller brain implants with a substantially extended battery life compared to the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>YAP+: Pad-Layout-Aware Yield Modeling and Simulation for Hybrid Bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) integration continues to advance Moore's Law by facilitating dense interconnects and enabling multi-tier system architectures. Among the various integration approaches, Cu-Cu hybrid bonding has emerged as a leading solution for achieving high interconnect density in chiplet integration. In this work, we present YAP+, a yield modeling framework specifically tailored for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding processes. YAP+ incorporates a comprehensive set of yield-impacting failure mechanisms, including overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and Cu pad density. Furthermore, YAP+ supports pad layout-aware yield analysis, considering critical, redundant, and dummy pads across arbitrary 2D physical layout patterns. To support practical evaluation, we developed an open-source yield simulator, demonstrating that our near-analytical model matches simulation accuracy while achieving over 1,000x speedup in runtime. This performance makes YAP+ a valuable tool for co-optimizing packaging technologies, assembly design rules, and system-level design strategies. Beyond W2W-D2W comparisons, we leverage YAP+ to investigate the impact of pad layout patterns, bonding pitch, and pad ratios across different pad types, and explore the benefits of strategically placing redundant pad replicas.</description>

      <title>Delay Time Characterization on FPGA: A Low Nonlinearity, Picosecond Resolution Time-to-Digital Converter on 16-nm FPGA using Bin Sequence Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.</description>

      <title>LUT-LLM: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Memory-based Computations on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has advanced numerous applications, yet efficient single-batch inference remains vital for on-device intelligence. While FPGAs offer fine-grained data control and high energy efficiency, recent GPU optimizations have narrowed their advantage, especially under arithmetic-based computation. To overcome this, we leverage FPGAs' abundant on-chip memory to shift LLM inference from arithmetic- to memory-based computation through table lookups. We present LUT-LLM, the first FPGA accelerator enabling 1B+ LLM inference via vector-quantized memory operations. Our analysis identifies activation-weight co-quantization as the most effective scheme, supported by (1) bandwidth-aware parallel centroid search, (2) efficient 2D table lookups, and (3) a spatial-temporal hybrid design minimizing data caching. Implemented on an AMD V80 FPGA for a customized Qwen 3 1.7B model, LUT-LLM achieves 1.66x lower latency than AMD MI210 and 1.72x higher energy efficiency than NVIDIA A100, scaling to 32B models with 2.16x efficiency gain over A100.</description>

      <title>STAR: Improving Lifetime and Performance of High-Capacity Modern SSDs Using State-Aware Randomizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although NAND flash memory has achieved continuous capacity improvements via advanced 3D stacking and multi-level cell technologies, these innovations introduce new reliability challenges, par- ticularly lateral charge spreading (LCS), absent in low-capacity 2D flash memory. Since LCS significantly increases retention errors over time, addressing this problem is essential to ensure the lifetime of modern SSDs employing high-capacity 3D flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel data randomizer, STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), which proactively eliminates the majority of weak data patterns responsible for retention errors caused by LCS. Unlike existing techniques that target only specific worst-case patterns, STAR effectively removes a broad spectrum of weak patterns, significantly enhancing reliability against LCS. By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR improves SSD lifetime by up to 2.3x and reduces read latency by an average of 50% on real-world traces compared to conventional SSDs</description>

      <title>Precision-Scalable Microscaling Datapaths with Optimized Reduction Tree for Efficient NPU Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging continual learning applications necessitate next-generation neural processing unit (NPU) platforms to support both training and inference operations. The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation. Moreover, we integrate an 8x8 array of these MACs into the state-of-the-art (SotA) NPU integration platform, SNAX, to provide efficient control and data transfer to our optimized precision-scalable MX datapath. We evaluate our design both on MAC and system level and compare it to the SotA. Our integrated system achieves an energy efficiency of 657, 1438-1675, and 4065 GOPS/W, respectively, for MXINT8, MXFP8/6, and MXFP4, with a throughput of 64, 256, and 512 GOPS.</description>

      <title>Offloading Data Center Tax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data centers of today are running diverse workloads sharing many common lower level functions called tax components. Any optimization to any tax component will lead to performance improvements across the data center fleet. Typically, performance enhancements in tax components are achieved by offloading them to accelerators, however, it is not practical to offload every tax component. The goal of this paper is to identify opportunities to offload more than one tax component together. We focus on MongoDB which is a common microservice used in a large number of applications in the datacenter. We profile MongoDB running as part of the DeathStarBench benchmark suite, identifying its tax components and their microarchitectural implications. We make observations and suggestions based on the inferences made to offload a few of the tax components in this application.</description>

      <title>FPGA or GPU? Analyzing comparative research for application-specific guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of computational workloads has amplified the need for efficient and specialized hardware accelerators. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as prominent solutions, each excelling in specific domains. Although there is substantial research comparing FPGAs and GPUs, most of the work focuses primarily on performance metrics, offering limited insight into the specific types of applications that each accelerator benefits the most. This paper aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing insights from various research articles to guide users in selecting the appropriate accelerator for domain-specific applications. By categorizing the reviewed studies and analyzing key performance metrics, this work highlights the strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases for FPGAs and GPUs. The findings offer actionable recommendations, helping researchers and practitioners navigate trade-offs in performance, energy efficiency, and programmability.</description>

      <title>EONSim: An NPU Simulator for On-Chip Memory and Embedding Vector Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding vector operations are a key component of modern deep neural network workloads. Unlike matrix operations with deterministic access patterns, embedding vector operations exhibit input data-dependent and non-deterministic memory accesses. Existing neural processing unit (NPU) simulators focus on matrix computations with simple double-buffered on-chip memory systems, lacking the modeling capability for realistic embedding behavior. Next-generation NPUs, however, call for more flexible on-chip memory architectures that can support diverse access and management schemes required by embedding workloads. To enable flexible exploration and design of emerging NPU architectures, we present EONSim, an NPU simulator that holistically models both matrix and embedding vector operations. EONSim integrates a validated performance model for matrix computations with detailed memory simulation for embedding accesses, supporting various on-chip memory management policies. Validated against TPUv6e, EONSim achieves an average inference time error of 1.4\% and an average on-chip memory access count error of 2.2\%.</description>

      <title>Preemption-Enhanced Benchmark Suite for FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become essential in cloud computing due to their reconfigurability, energy efficiency, and ability to accelerate domain-specific workloads. As FPGA adoption grows, research into task scheduling and preemption techniques has intensified. However, the field lacks a standardized benchmarking framework for consistent and reproducible evaluation. Many existing studies propose innovative scheduling or preemption mechanisms but often rely on proprietary or synthetic benchmarks, limiting generalizability and making comparison difficult. This methodical fragmentation hinders effective evaluation of scheduling strategies and preemption in multi-tenant FPGA environments.
  This paper presents the first open-source preemption-enabled benchmark suite for evaluating FPGA preemption strategies and testing new scheduling algorithms, without requiring users to create preemption workloads from scratch. The suite includes 27 diverse applications spanning cryptography, AI/ML, computation-intensive workloads, communication systems, and multimedia processing. Each benchmark integrates comprehensive context-saving and restoration mechanisms, facilitating reproducible research and consistent comparisons. Our suite not only simplifies testing FPGA scheduling policies but also benefits OS research by enabling the evaluation of scheduling fairness, resource allocation efficiency, and context-switching performance in multi-tenant FPGA systems, ultimately supporting the development of better operating systems and scheduling policies for FPGA-based environments. We also provide guidelines for adding new benchmarks, enabling future research to expand and refine FPGA preemption and scheduling evaluation.</description>

      <title>ASTER: Attention-based Spiking Transformer Engine for Event-driven Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with transformer-based architectures has opened new opportunities for bio-inspired low-power, event-driven visual reasoning on edge devices. However, the high temporal resolution and binary nature of spike-driven computation introduce architectural mismatches with conventional digital hardware (CPU/GPU). Prior neuromorphic and Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerators struggle with high sparsity and complex operations prevalent in such models. To address these challenges, we propose a memory-centric hardware accelerator tailored for spiking transformers, optimized for deployment in real-time event-driven frameworks such as classification with both static and event-based input frames. Our design leverages a hybrid analog-digital PIM architecture with input sparsity optimizations, and a custom-designed dataflow to minimize memory access overhead and maximize data reuse under spatiotemporal sparsity, for compute and memory-efficient end-to-end execution of spiking transformers. We subsequently propose inference-time software optimizations for layer skipping, and timestep reduction, leveraging Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to perform robust, efficient co-exploration of the joint algorithmic-microarchitectural design spaces under tight computational budgets. Evaluated on both image(ImageNet) and event-based (CIFAR-10 DVS, DVSGesture) classification, the accelerator achieves up to ~467x and ~1.86x energy reduction compared to edge GPU (Jetson Orin Nano) and previous PIM accelerators for spiking transformers, while maintaining competitive task accuracy on ImageNet dataset. This work enables a new class of intelligent ubiquitous edge AI, built using spiking transformer acceleration for low-power, real-time visual processing at the extreme edge.</description>

      <title>P3-LLM: An Integrated NPU-PIM Accelerator for LLM Inference Using Hybrid Numerical Formats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demand of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively. Our quantization code is available at https://github.com/yc2367/P3-LLM.git</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a fundamental operation in many scientific workloads, signal processing, and particularly deep learning. It is often a bottleneck for performance and energy efficiency, especially in edge environments with tight resource and power constraints. AMD's Versal ACAP offers heterogeneous components (AIEs, PL, PS) that can address these challenges, but mapping GEMM across them is complex, with prior works largely overlooking energy-performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for Versal ACAP that generates GEMM mappings optimized for either performance or energy efficiency. Unlike prior analytical approaches, our method leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model, trained on approximately 6000 on-board experiments of different GEMM mappings, to guide Design Space Exploration, yielding more efficient designs. Evaluation on the Versal VCK190 shows geomean improvements of 1.23x (up to 2.5x) in throughput and 1.25x (up to 2.7x) in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art frameworks.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Accelerated RISC-V ISA Extensions for Efficient Neural Network Inference on Edge Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge AI deployment faces critical challenges balancing computational performance, energy efficiency, and resource constraints. This paper presents FPGA-accelerated RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions for efficient neural network inference on resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a custom RISC-V core with four novel ISA extensions (FPGA.VCONV, FPGA.GEMM, FPGA.RELU, FPGA.CUSTOM) and integrated neural network accelerators, implemented and validated on the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 platform. The complete system achieves 2.14x average latency speedup and 49.1% energy reduction versus an ARM Cortex-A9 software baseline across four benchmark models (MobileNet V2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet Lite, YOLO Tiny). Hardware implementation closes timing with +12.793 ns worst negative slack at 50 MHz while using 0.43% LUTs and 11.4% BRAM for the base core and 38.8% DSPs when accelerators are active. Hardware verification confirms successful FPGA deployment with verified 64 KB BRAM memory interface and AXI interconnect functionality. All performance metrics are obtained from physical hardware measurements. This work establishes a reproducible framework for ISA-guided FPGA acceleration that complements fixed-function ASICs by trading peak performance for programmability.</description>

      <title>FiCABU: A Fisher-Based, Context-Adaptive Machine Unlearning Processor for Edge AI</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning, driven by privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten", is increasingly needed at the edge, yet server-centric or retraining-heavy methods are impractical under tight computation and energy budgets. We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline. In sum, FiCABU demonstrates that back-end-first, depth-aware unlearning can be made both practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.</description>

      <title>wa-hls4ml: A Benchmark and Surrogate Models for hls4ml Resource and Latency Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.</description>

      <title>Lite VLA: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Control on CPU-Bound Edge Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of artificial intelligence models at the edge is increasingly critical for autonomous robots operating in GPS-denied environments where local, resource-efficient reasoning is essential. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on mobile robots to achieve real-time scene understanding and reasoning under strict computational constraints. Unlike prior approaches that separate perception from mobility, the proposed framework enables simultaneous movement and reasoning in dynamic environments using only on-board hardware. The system integrates a compact VLM with multimodal perception to perform contextual interpretation directly on embedded hardware, eliminating reliance on cloud connectivity. Experimental validation highlights the balance between computational efficiency, task accuracy, and system responsiveness. Implementation on a mobile robot confirms one of the first successful deployments of small VLMs for concurrent reasoning and mobility at the edge. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, assured autonomy in applications such as service robotics, disaster response, and defense operations.</description>

      <title>AiEDA: An Open-Source AI-Aided Design Library for Design-to-Vector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist electronic design automation (EDA) in improving both the quality and efficiency of chip design. But current AI for EDA (AI-EDA) infrastructures remain fragmented, lacking comprehensive solutions for the entire data pipeline from design execution to AI integration. Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA, while the full iDATA dataset is being prepared for public release, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.</description>

      <title>Bespoke Co-processor for Energy-Efficient Health Monitoring on RISC-V-based Flexible Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible electronics offer unique advantages for conformable, lightweight, and disposable healthcare wearables. However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables. Our microprocessors achieve an average 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>SoK: Systematizing a Decade of Architectural RowHammer Defenses Through the Lens of Streaming Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A decade after its academic introduction, RowHammer (RH) remains a moving target that continues to challenge both the industry and academia. With its potential to serve as a critical attack vector, the ever-decreasing RH threshold now threatens DRAM process technology scaling, with a superlinearly increasing cost of RH protection solutions. Due to their generality and relatively lower performance costs, architectural RH solutions are the first line of defense against RH. However, the field is fragmented with varying views of the problem, terminologies, and even threat models.
  In this paper, we systematize architectural RH defenses from the last decade through the lens of streaming algorithms. We provide a taxonomy that encompasses 48 different works. We map multiple architectural RH defenses to the classical streaming algorithms, which extends to multiple proposals that did not identify this link. We also provide two practitioner guides. The first guide analyzes which algorithm best fits a given RHTH, location, process technology, storage type, and mitigative action. The second guide encourages future research to consult existing algorithms when architecting RH defenses. We illustrate this by demonstrating how Reservoir-Sampling can improve related RH defenses, and also introduce StickySampling that can provide mathematical security that related studies do not guarantee.</description>

      <title>DMA Collectives for Efficient ML Communication Offloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offloading machine learning (ML) communication collectives to direct memory access (DMA) engines has emerged as an interesting and low-cost solution to efficiently overlap computation and communication in inference and training. Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).
  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries.</description>

      <title>ReQISC: A Reconfigurable Quantum Computer Microarchitecture and Compiler Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of current quantum hardware is severely limited. While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical.
  To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of "reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead.
  We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible.</description>

      <title>SONIQ: System-Optimized Noise-Injected Ultra-Low-Precision Quantization with Full-Precision Parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-low-precision inference can sharply reduce memory and latency but often degrades accuracy and relies on specialized hardware. We present SONIQ, a system-optimized, noise-injected quantization framework that learns per-channel mixed precision for both weights and activations while training under the same rules used at inference. By injecting hardware-calibrated quantization noise during training, SONIQ steers models toward the discrete arithmetic used at deployment -- without bespoke runtimes. Across CNNs and Transformers, SONIQ achieves up to 16x and 7x compression, respectively, while matching or exceeding full-precision accuracy. Measured end-to-end, SONIQ delivers up to 7.3x CPU speedup over strong INT8 baselines and up to 6.3x (vector units) / 2.8x (tensor cores) GPU speedup relative to FP16. A practical outcome is that two per-channel precision levels -- one in the 1--4-bit range and one in the 4--8-bit range -- suffice in practice; at inference, each channel selects one of the two, keeping kernels simple and fast. To our knowledge, SONIQ is the first framework to reach or surpass full-precision accuracy under ultra-low (1--4 bits per parameter) regimes while remaining deployable on commodity hardware, narrowing the gap between quantization theory and practical, high-throughput inference.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have great potential to enhance productivity in many disciplines, such as software engineering. However, it is unclear to what extent they can assist in the design process of electronic circuits. This paper focuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design for printed circuit boards (PCBs). We present multiple LLM-based workflows that combine reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a custom toolkit that enables the LLM to interact with SPICE simulations to estimate the impact of circuit modifications. Two benchmark experiments are presented to analyze the performance of LLM-based assistants for different design tasks, including parameter tuning, topology adaption and optimization of SMPS circuits. Experiment results show that SPICE simulation feedback and current LLM advancements, such as reasoning, significantly increase the solve rate on 269 manually created benchmark tasks from 15% to 91%. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that most parameter tuning design tasks can be solved, while limits remain for certain topology adaption tasks. Our experiments offer insights for improving current concepts, for example by adapting text-based circuit representations</description>

      <title>ISAAC: Intelligent, Scalable, Agile, and Accelerated CPU Verification via LLM-aided FPGA Parallelism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional verification is a critical bottleneck in integrated circuit development, with CPU verification being especially time-intensive and labour-consuming. Industrial practice relies on differential testing for CPU verification, yet faces bottlenecks at nearly each stage of the framework pipeline: front-end stimulus generation lacks micro-architectural awareness, yielding low-quality and redundant tests that impede coverage closure and miss corner cases. Meanwhile, back-end simulation infrastructure, even with FPGA acceleration, often stalls on long-running tests and offers limited visibility, delaying feedback and prolonging the debugging cycle. Here, we present ISAAC, a full-stack, Large Language Model (LLM)-aided CPU verification framework with FPGA parallelism, from bug categorisation and stimulus generation to simulation infrastructure. To do so, we presented a multi-agent stimulus engine in ISAAC's front-end, infused with micro-architectural knowledge and historical bug patterns, generating highly targeted tests that rapidly achieve coverage goals and capture elusive corner cases. In ISAAC's back-end, we introduce a lightweight forward-snapshot mechanism and a decoupled co-simulation architecture between the Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) and the Design Under Test (DUT), enabling a single ISS to drive multiple DUTs in parallel. By eliminating long-tail test bottlenecks and exploiting FPGA parallelism, the simulation throughput is significantly improved. As a demonstration, we used ISAAC to verify a mature CPU that has undergone multiple successful tape-outs. Results show up to 17,536x speed-up over software RTL simulation, while detecting several previously unknown bugs, two of which are reported in this paper.</description>

Abstract: The security and efficiency of modern computing systems are fundamentally undermined by the absence of a native architectural mechanism to propagate high-level program semantics, such as object identity, bounds, and lifetime, across the hardware/software interface. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the architectural paradigm designed to bridge this semantic gap: descriptor-based, object-aware memory systems. By elevating the descriptor to a first-class architectural abstraction, this paradigm enables hardware to dynamically acquire and enforce the rich semantics of software-defined objects. This survey systematically charts the evolution and current landscape of this approach. We establish the foundational concepts of memory objects and descriptors and introduce a novel taxonomy of descriptor addressing modes, providing a structured framework for analyzing and comparing diverse implementations. Our unified analysis reveals how this paradigm holistically addresses the intertwined challenges of memory protection, management, and processing. As a culminating case study, we re-examine the CentroID model, demonstrating how its hybrid tagged-pointer encoding and descriptor processing mechanisms embody the path toward practical and efficient object-aware designs. Finally, we outline how the explicit cross-layer communication of object semantics provides a foundational research direction for next-generation cache hierarchies, unified virtual memory, and even 128-bit architectures.</description>

      <title>FlashMoE: Fast Distributed MoE in a Single Kernel</title>

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, thus offering a scalable path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations suffer from low GPU utilization, significant latency overhead, and a fundamental inability to leverage task locality, primarily due to CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashMoE, a fully GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU communication into a single persistent GPU kernel. FlashMoE enables fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Unlike existing work, FlashMoE eliminates bulk-synchronous collectives for one-sided, device-initiated, inter-GPU (R)DMA transfers, thereby unlocking payload efficiency by eliminating bloated or redundant network payloads in sparsely activated layers. When evaluated on an 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models comprising up to 128 experts and 16K token sequences, FlashMoE achieves up to 9x higher GPU utilization, 6x lower latency, 5.7x higher throughput, and 4x better overlap efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using FP32, whereas the baselines use FP16. FlashMoE shows that principled GPU kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of large-scale distributed ML.

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>

      <title>From GPUs to RRAMs: Distributed In-Memory Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Solving Large-Scale Linear Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137</link>

Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</description>

      <title>SnapStream: Efficient Long Sequence Decoding on Dataflow Accelerators</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.</description>
