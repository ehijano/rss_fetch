      <title>Bound surface states and the nuclear spin relaxation of $^{199}$Hg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible use of optically pumped $^{199}$Hg nuclear spin magnetometry for fundamental physics studies, particularly in the search for electric dipole moments, remains of great interest. Understanding surface-induced relaxation is necessary for the development of both large- and small-volume cells that have a long and stable nuclear spin lifetime. Such cells are critical to several ongoing experiments, including the measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment, zero or otherwise. $^{199}$Hg, due to its large mass, has a multitude of bound surface states that affect the interaction time with the surface and are an important factor in the interpretation of previously acquired data. It is shown that the inclusion of these states brings consistency to the derived surface interaction properties.</description>

      <title>Study of $^{7}$Li elastic scattering and the lithium-induced reaction of one-nucleon transfers from $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular distributions of elastic scattering of $^{7}$Li, as well as the lithium-induced reaction of one-nucleon transfers $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B were measured at $E_{lab}$ = 58 MeV. Experiment was done using U-400 accelerator beam of the FLNR JINR, Dubna. Angular distribution for reaction $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B with excitation of the 3.56 MeV state ($^{6}$Li*) is present for the first time. The DWBA analysis of the differential cross section of the $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B ground state (g.s.) transition and excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state of $^{6}$Li transition was performed. The optical model potentials were obtained by fitting of measured elastic scattering data and evaluating parameters for the output reaction channels. Phenomenological approaching based on solving an approximate equation for the reaction form factor was used to determine its radial dependence and empirical values of asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). Obtained values of ANCs for the $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ and $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) states are similar to literature one. Comparison of the radial dependences of form factors shows that the wave function of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state has increased spatial dimension compared to the ground state, and in both cases some larger spatial size than the ground states of the $^{11}$B and $^{10}$B. Within the framework of our analysis, we can confirm that the radius of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in the 3.56 MeV state is larger than in the ground state. This result is an argument in favor of a halo existence in $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) state, while the question of a halo in $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ still leaves open.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of uranium-233 neutron capture cross section in keV region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uranium-233 neutron capture cross section between 3 keV and 1 MeV was evaluated with the new alpha value recently measured at the Los Alamos National Laboratory LANCE facility and compiled in the EXFOR library. The obtained capture cross section is systematically lower than those in the latest versions of the major general purpose nuclear data libraries, and the reduction from the JENDL-5 library is close to 50% around 20 keV. The newly evaluated cross section was benchmarked against 166 criticality experiments chosen from the ICSBEP handbook by performing Monte Carlo neutron transport calculation with the JENDL-5 library, and slight reduction of the cumulative chi-square value was achieved by adoption of the newly evaluated capture cross section.</description>

      <title>Modeling net-charge fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of Pb+Pb data for net-charge fluctuations at LHC energies within the HYDJET++ model is presented. The strongly intensive quantities $D$ and $\Sigma$ are used to get rid of the effects related to volume fluctuations of the system. We employ two versions of the HYDJET++ for the analysis. The first one is the standard or default version, whereas the second one represents its further modification, which takes into account explicit event-by-event conservation of the electric net-charge of produced particles. Inclusion of the canonical net-charge conservation in the model allows one for better description of the experimental data obtained by the ALICE and the CMS Collaborations. Comparison with calculations of other models is also presented.</description>

      <title>Electron-nucleus cross sections from transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) allows a deep neural network (DNN) trained on one type of data to be adapted for new problems with limited information. We propose to use the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the physics of one process, and after fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the DNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after fine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions with nuclear targets ranging from lithium to iron. The method works even when the DNN is fine-tuned on a small dataset.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study low-energy nuclear physics
  at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we extract valuable insights into both processes. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and eA scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the Radiative Decay of the Hoyle State with Charged-Particle Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed knowledge of the decay properties of the so called Hoyle state in the $^{12}$C nucleus ($E_x=7.654$ MeV, $0^+$) is required to calculate the rate at which carbon is forged in typical red-giant stars. This paper reports on a new almost background-free measurement of the radiative decay branching ratio of the Hoyle state using advanced charged particle coincidence techniques. The exploitation, for the first time in a similar experiment, of a bidimensional map of the coincidence efficiency allows to reach an unitary value and, consequently, to strongly reduce sources of systematic uncertainties. The present results suggest a value of the radiative branching ratio of $\Gamma_{rad}/\Gamma_{tot}=4.2(6)\cdot10^{-4}$. This finding helps to resolve the tension between recent data published in the literature.</description>
