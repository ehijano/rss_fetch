      <title>A vector Helmholtz electromagnetic wave propagator for inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector electric-field Helmholtz equation, containing cross-polarization terms, is factored to produce both pseudo-differential and exponential operator forms of a three-dimensional, one-way, vector, wave equation for propagation through inhomogeneous media. From this operator factorization we develop a high-order approximate, vector Helmholtz propagator that correctly handles forward-arc, high-angle scattering and diffraction from inhomogeneities at all resolved length scales, and seamlessly includes evanescent waves.
  A rational approximation/partial fraction decomposition of the exponential operator converts the propagator into a moderate number of large, sparse, linear solves whose results are summed together at each step to advance the electric field in space. We use a new AAA-Lawson rational interpolant for this approximation, rather than the more common Pad\'{e} expansions that have appeared in the seismic and ocean acoustics literature previously. GMRES is used to solve these large systems. A direct-solve, free space propagation method proves to be an effective preconditioner for GMRES, but can also serve as a standalone propagator in homogeneous media. Scalar computational examples shown include plane wave diffraction by a circular aperture and Gaussian beam propagation through sine-product and homogeneous refractive index fields. The sine-product example compares its results to that of paraxial propagation through the same media, and demonstrates the substantial differences between these propagator paradigms when the scale of the inhomogeneities is of the order of the fundamental wavelength in the Helmholtz equation. We also examine the convergence of the homogeneous media beam results to fields generated by Clenshaw-Curtis evaluation of the first Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral for the same initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Indenting fractal-edged elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface roughness plays a crucial role in the accuracy of indentation experiments used to measure the elastic properties of materials. In this study, we present a computational analysis of how surface roughness, represented explicitly by fractal geometry, influences the mechanical properties of soft materials. We model two-dimensional elastic samples with a Koch fractal bottom surface, grown upward or downward to the fourth generation, referred to as fractal \textit{down} and fractal \textit{up}, respectively. The elastodynamics equations are solved numerically while a rigid punch indents the elastic sample from the top surface. By applying the Hertz model for mechanical contact, we determine the Young's modulus of the materials. Our findings reveal that fractal surfaces, especially those with dimensions comparable to the sample size, can significantly alter experimental measurement outcomes. In particular, the roughness of the substrate profoundly affects the measured elastic properties, as seen in scenarios involving cell elasticity. For instance, in the \textit{down} fractal scenario, reductions in the measured elastic modulus range from 2\% to 4\%, while increases reach up to 40\% in the \textit{up} fractal scenario. These results underscore the importance of incorporating fractal geometry into the design and analysis of indentation experiments. This approach could significantly enhance our understanding and application of material characterization and mechanical testing, leading to more accurate and reliable results.</description>

      <title>Univariate Conditional Variational Autoencoder for Morphogenic Patterns Design in Frontal Polymerization-Based Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid reaction-thermal diffusion during frontal polymerization (FP) with variations in initial and boundary conditions destabilizes the planar mode of front propagation, leading to spatially varying complex hierarchical patterns in polymeric materials. Although modern reaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP, the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that produce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the nonunique and nonintuitive mapping between process conditions and patterns. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic generative model named univariate conditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of hierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes both the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design space. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters is significantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter training time while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images, the trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions that produce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.</description>

      <title>Advanced simulations with PLUMED: OPES and Machine Learning Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological processes occur on time scales longer than those accessible to molecular dynamics simulations. Identifying collective variables (CVs) and introducing an external potential to accelerate them is a popular approach to address this problem. In particular, $\texttt{PLUMED}$ is a community-developed library that implements several methods for CV-based enhanced sampling. This chapter discusses two recent developments that have gained popularity in recent years. The first is the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method as a biasing scheme. This provides a unified approach to enhanced sampling able to cover many different scenarios: from free energy convergence to the discovery of metastable states, from rate calculation to generalized ensemble simulation. The second development concerns the use of machine learning (ML) approaches to determine CVs by learning the relevant variables directly from simulation data. The construction of these variables is facilitated by the $\texttt{mlcolvar}$ library, which allows them to be optimized in Python and then used to enhance sampling thanks to a native interface inside $\texttt{PLUMED}$. For each of these methods, in addition to a brief introduction, we provide guidelines, practical suggestions and point to examples from the literature to facilitate their use in the study of the process of interest.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>A fully-coupled algorithm with implicit surface tension treatment for interfacial flows with large density ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of most surface-tension-driven interfacial flow simulations is governed by the capillary time-step constraint. This concerns particularly small-scale flows and, more generally, highly-resolved liquid-gas simulations with moderate inertia. To date, the majority of interfacial-flow simulations are performed using an explicit surface-tension treatment, which restrains the performance of such simulations. Recently, an implicit treatment of surface tension able to breach the capillary time-step constraint using the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method was proposed, based on a fully-coupled pressure-based finite-volume algorithm. To this end, the interface-advection equation is incorporated implicitly into the linear flow solver, resulting in a tight coupling between all implicit solution variables (colour function, pressure, velocity). However, this algorithm is limited to uniform density and viscosity fields. Here, we present a fully-coupled algorithm for interfacial flows with implicit surface tension applicable to interfacial flows with large density and viscosity ratios. This is achieved by solving the continuity and momentum equations in conservative form, whereby the density is treated implicitly with respect to the colour function, and the advection term of the interface-advection equation is discretised using the THINC/QQ algebraic VOF scheme, yielding a consistent discretisation of the advective terms. This new algorithm is tested by considering representative surface-tension-dominated interfacial flows, including the Laplace equilibrium of a stationary droplet and the three-dimensional Rayleigh-Plateau instability of a liquid filament. The presented results demonstrate that interfacial flows with large density and viscosity ratios can be simulated and energy conservation is ensured, even with a time step larger than the capillary time-step constraint.</description>

      <title>In silico design and prediction of metastable quaternary phases in Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quaternary phases formed in copper alloys are investigated through a combination of quantum-mechanical and classical computer simulations and active machine learning. Focus is given on nickel, silicon, and chromium impurities in a copper matrix. The analysis of the formation enthalpies of candidate quaternary structures leads to the prediction of two novel quaternary phases and the assessment of their stability. For the predicted two phases, machine learned atomistic potentials are developed using active learning with a quantum-mechanical accuracy. Use of these potentials in atomistic simulations further elucidates the structure, temperature-dependent dynamics, and elastic behavior of the predicted quaternary phases in copper alloys. The combined in silico approach is thus proven highly efficient in both designing materials and elucidating their properties and potential combining different spatiotemporal scales. In the case of alloys, this computational scheme significantly reduces the effort in searching the huge chemical space of possible phases, enhancing the efficiency in synthesizing novel alloys with pre-defined properties.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the benefits of using computer simulations in the school environment are widely recognized by educators. The encouragement to use these simulations in classrooms is supported by the National Common Curricular Base, a normative document that defines essential learning for basic education. This article focuses on the exploration of the Mechanical Energy Conservation simulator, a free simulator developed with the purpose of illustrating the transformations between kinetic, gravitational potential, and elastic potential energies. This application is part of SimuF\'isica\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, a multilingual and multiplatform software that offers computer simulations for teaching physics, which operates both online and offline. Throughout the article, some features of the SimuF\'isic\textsuperscript{\textregistered} platform and the details of how the Mechanical Energy Conservation simulator works are objectively presented. Two illustrative examples are provided, demonstrating the application in action for solving mechanics problems.</description>

This solver maintains the benefits of other solvers presently considered, while superceding their usefulness within its own regime. FLiMESolve is able to efficiently and accurately simulate time-periodic systems while being faster and more accurate than other solvers and with the ability to relax the secular approximation inherent to the Lindblad Equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of sound propagation in narrow geometries need to account for viscous and thermal losses. In this respect, effective boundary conditions that model viscothermal losses in frequency-domain acoustics have recently gained in popularity. Here, we investigate the time-domain analogue of one such boundary condition. We find that the thermal part of the boundary condition is passive in time domain as expected, while the viscous part is not. More precisely, we demonstrate that the viscous part is responsible for exponentially growing normal modes with unbounded temporal growth rates, which indicates ill-posedness of the considered model. A finite-difference-time-domain scheme is developed for simulations of lossy sound propagation in a duct. If viscous losses are neglected the obtained transmission characteristics are found to be in excellent agreement with frequency-domain simulations. In the general case, the simulations experience an instability much in line with the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Portable, Massively Parallel Implementation of a Material Point Method for Compressible Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent evolution of software and hardware technologies is leading to a renewed computational interest in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods such as the Material Point Method (MPM). Indeed, provided some critical aspects are properly handled, PIC methods can be cast in formulations suitable for the requirements of data locality and fine-grained parallelism of modern hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Such a rapid and continuous technological development increases also the importance of generic and portable implementations. While the capabilities of MPM on a wide range continuum mechanics problem have been already well assessed, the use of the method in compressible fluid dynamics has received less attention. In this paper we present a portable, highly parallel, GPU based MPM solver for compressible gas dynamics. The implementation aims to reach a good compromise between portability and efficiency in order to provide a first assessment of the potential of this approach in solving strongly compressible gas flow problems, also taking into account solid obstacles. The numerical model considered constitutes a first step towards the development of a monolithic MPM solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems at all Mach numbers up to the supersonic regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately determining the effective Hubbard parameter $(U_{eff})$ in Density Functional Theory plus U (DFT+U) remains a significant challenge, often relying on empirical methods or linear response theory, which frequently fail to predict accurate material properties. This study introduces BMach, an advanced Bayesian optimization algorithm that refines $U_{eff}$ by incorporating electronic properties, such as band gaps and eigenvalues, alongside structural properties like lattice parameters. Implemented within the Quantum Espresso platform, BMach demonstrates superior accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. The BMach-optimized $U_{eff}$ values yield electronic properties that align closely with experimental and high-level theoretical results, providing a robust framework for high-throughput materials discovery and detailed electronic property characterization across diverse material systems.</description>

Abstract: We present Quantum MASALA, a compact package that implements different electronic structure methods in Python using the plane-wave basis. Within just 8100 lines of pure Python code, we have implemented Density Functional Theory (DFT), Time-dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) and the GW Method. The program can run across multiple processors and in Graphical Processing Units (GPU) with the help of easily accessible Python libraries. With Quantum ESPRESSO and BerkeleyGW input interfaces implemented, it can also be used as a substitute for small and medium scale calculations, making it a perfect learning tool for ab initio methods. The package is aimed to provide a framework with its modular and simple code design to rapidly build and test new methods for first-principles calculation.</description>

Abstract: Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for improved performance remains elusive. Our study address this problem by investigating the functional expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through numerical experiments on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Letter datasets, our hybrid quantum-classical CNN model demonstrates superior feature selection capabilities and substantially reduces the required training steps compared to classical CNNs. Notably, we observe similar performance improvements when incorporating three other quantum-inspired activation functions in classical neural networks, indicating the benefits of adopting quantum-inspired activation functions. Additionally, we developed a hybrid quantum Chebyshev-polynomial network (QCPN) based on the properties of quantum activation functions. We demonstrate that a three-layer QCPN can approximate any continuous function, a feat not achievable by a standard three-layer classical neural network. Our findings suggest that quantum-inspired activation functions can reduce model depth while maintaining high learning capability, making them a promising approach for optimizing large-scale machine-learning models. We also outline future research directions for leveraging quantum advantages in machine learning, aiming to unlock further potential in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Plasma stratification in AC discharges in noble gases at low currents</title>

Abstract: A hybrid kinetic-fluid model is used to study plasma stratification in alternating current (AC) discharges in noble gases at low plasma densities. Self-consistent coupled solutions of a nonlocal kinetic equation for electrons, a drift-diffusion equation of ions, and a Poisson equation for the electric field are obtained for a positive column and the entire discharge with near-electrode sheaths. A simplified two-level excitation-ionization model neglects the nonlinear effects due to stepwise ionization, gas heating, and Coulomb interactions among electrons. Standing striations are obtained for the reduced values of electric fields, E/p, corresponding to the inelastic energy balance of electrons in a range of driving frequencies. An analog of Novak law (striation length proportional to the excitation threshold of atoms and inversely proportional to the mean square root of the electric field), is observed in simulations, indicating the nonlocal nature of standing striations in AC discharges at low plasma densities. Stratified plasma operates in a dynamic regime for various driving frequencies. In this regime, ions respond to the time-averaged electric field, whereas electrons react to the instantaneous electric field. The disparity of time scales between ambipolar diffusion, which occurs at the ion time scale, and electron kinetics in the coordinate-energy phase space, which occurs at the free electron diffusion time scale, produces complicated fluxes in the phase space (due to electron heating, energy loss in collisions, and ionization processes) that are responsible for the stratification. Our paper emphasizes the need for the kinetic approach to analyze stratification phenomena in AC discharge of noble gases. It promotes an efficient method for the kinetic treatment of electrons that is an alternative to the commonly used PIC method.</description>

      <title>Deconvoluting Thermomechanical Effects in X-ray Diffraction Data using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction is ideal for probing sub-surface state during complex or rapid thermomechanical loading of crystalline materials. However, challenges arise as the size of diffraction volumes increases due to spatial broadening and inability to deconvolute the effects of different lattice deformation mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach to use combinations of physics-based modeling and machine learning to deconvolve thermal and mechanical elastic strains for diffraction data analysis. The method builds on a previous effort to extract thermal strain distribution information from diffraction data. The new approach is applied to extract the evolution of thermomechanical state during laser melting of an Inconel 625 wall specimen which produces significant residual stress upon cooling. A combination of heat transfer and fluid flow, elasto-plasticity, and X-ray diffraction simulations are used to generate training data for machine-learning (Gaussian Process Regression, GPR) models that map diffracted intensity distributions to underlying thermomechanical strain fields. First-principles density functional theory is used to determine accurate temperature-dependent thermal expansion and elastic stiffness used for elasto-plasticity modeling. The trained GPR models are found to be capable of deconvoluting the effects of thermal and mechanical strains, in addition to providing information about underlying strain distributions, even from complex diffraction patterns with irregularly shaped peaks.</description>
