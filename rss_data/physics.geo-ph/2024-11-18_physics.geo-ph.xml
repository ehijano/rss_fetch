      <title>Satellite monitoring of long period ocean-induced magnetic field variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite magnetic field observations have the potential to provide valuable information on dynamics, heat content and salinity throughout the ocean. Here we present the expected spatio-temporal characteristics of the ocean-induced magnetic field at satellite altitude on periods of months to decades. We compare these to the characteristics of other sources of Earth's magnetic field, and discuss whether it is feasible for the ocean-induced magnetic field to be retrieved and routinely monitored from space.
  We focus on large length scales (spherical harmonic degrees up to 30) and periods from one month up to five years. To characterize the expected ocean signal we make use of advanced numerical simulations taking high resolution oceanographic inputs and solve the magnetic induction equation in 3D including galvanic coupling and self induction effects. We find the time-varying ocean-induced signal dominates over the primary source of the internal field, the core dynamo, at high spherical harmonic degree with the cross-over taking place at degree 15 to 20 depending on the considered period. The ionospheric and magnetospheric fields (including their Earth induced counterparts) have most power on periods shorter than one month and are expected to be mostly zonal in magnetic coordinates at satellite altitude.
  Based on these findings we discuss future prospects for isolating and monitoring long period ocean induced magnetic field variations using data collected by present and upcoming magnetic survey satellites.</description>

      <title>Forces and grain-grain contacts in bidisperse beds sheared by viscous fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Gonzalez et al., 2023), we investigated the motion of grains within a granular bed sheared by a viscous fluid, and showed how segregation and hardening occur in the fluid- (bedload) and solid-like (creep) regions. In this paper, we inquire further into the mechanisms leading to grain segregation in a bidisperse bed, and how the forces are distributed. For that, we carried out numerical simulations at the grain scale by using CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method), with which we were able to track the positions, velocities, forces, and solid contacts underwent by each grain. We show that during the upward motion of large grains the direct action of fluid forces is significant in the middle and upper parts of the bedload layer, while only contact forces are significant in the creep layer and lower part of the bedload layer. We also show that in all cases the particles experience a moment about a -45 degrees contact point (with respect to the horizontal plane) when migrating upward, whether entrained by other contacts or directly by the fluid. In addition, we show the variations in the average solid-solid contacts, and how forces caused either by solid-solid contacts or directly by the fluid are distributed within the bed. Our results provide the relationship between force propagation and reorganization of grains in sheared beds, explaining mechanisms found, for example, in river beds and landslides.</description>
