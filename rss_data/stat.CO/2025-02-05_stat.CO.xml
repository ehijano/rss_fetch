      <title>Target-aware Bayesian inference via generalized thermodynamic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, we are usually interested in the numerical approximation of integrals that are posterior expectations or marginal likelihoods (a.k.a., Bayesian evidence). In this paper, we focus on the computation of the posterior expectation of a function $f(\x)$. We consider a \emph{target-aware} scenario where $f(\x)$ is known in advance and can be exploited in order to improve the estimation of the posterior expectation. In this scenario, this task can be reduced to perform several independent marginal likelihood estimation tasks. The idea of using a path of tempered posterior distributions has been widely applied in the literature for the computation of marginal likelihoods. Thermodynamic integration, path sampling and annealing importance sampling are well-known examples of algorithms belonging to this family of methods. In this work, we introduce a generalized thermodynamic integration (GTI) scheme which is able to perform a target-aware Bayesian inference, i.e., GTI can approximate the posterior expectation of a given function. Several scenarios of application of GTI are discussed and different numerical simulations are provided.</description>

      <title>Robust and Conjugate Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space formulations allow for Gaussian process (GP) regression with linear-in-time computational cost in spatio-temporal settings, but performance typically suffers in the presence of outliers. In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</description>

      <title>Estimating Network Models using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are very flexible for modeling network formation but pose difficult estimation challenges due to their intractable normalizing constant. Existing methods, such as MCMC-MLE, rely on sequential simulation at every optimization step. We propose a neural network approach that trains on a single, large set of parameter-simulation pairs to learn the mapping from parameters to average network statistics. Once trained, this map can be inverted, yielding a fast and parallelizable estimation method. The procedure also accommodates extra network statistics to mitigate model misspecification. Some simple illustrative examples show that the method performs well in practice.</description>

      <title>Is this normal? A new projection pursuit index to assess a sample against a multivariate null distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many data problems contain some reference or normal conditions, upon which to compare newly collected data. This scenario occurs in data collected as part of clinical trials to detect adverse events, or for measuring climate change against historical norms. The data is typically multivariate, and often the normal ranges are specified by a multivariate normal distribution. The work presented in this paper develops methods to compare the new sample against the reference distribution with high-dimensional visualisation. It uses a projection pursuit guided tour to produce a sequence of low-dimensional projections steered towards those where the new sample is most different from the reference. A new projection pursuit index is defined for this purpose. The tour visualisation also includes drawing of the projected ellipse, which is computed analytically, corresponding to the reference distribution. The methods are implemented in the R package, tourr.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Bayesian Multitask Model with Scalable Inference for Microbiome Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian multitask learning model that is applicable to the general multi-task binary classification learning problem where the model assumes a shared sparsity structure across different tasks. We derive a computationally efficient inference algorithm based on variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the potential of the new approach on various synthetic datasets and for predicting human health status based on microbiome profile. Our analysis incorporates data pooled from multiple microbiome studies, along with a comprehensive comparison with other benchmark methods. Results in synthetic datasets show that the proposed approach has superior support recovery property when the underlying regression coefficients share a common sparsity structure across different tasks. Our experiments on microbiome classification demonstrate the utility of the method in extracting informative taxa while providing well-calibrated predictions with uncertainty quantification and achieving competitive performance in terms of prediction metrics. Notably, despite the heterogeneity of the pooled datasets (e.g., different experimental objectives, laboratory setups, sequencing equipment, patient demographics), our method delivers robust results.</description>

      <title>Reliable Pseudo-labeling via Optimal Transport with Attention for Short Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short text clustering has gained significant attention in the data mining community. However, the limited valuable information contained in short texts often leads to low-discriminative representations, increasing the difficulty of clustering. This paper proposes a novel short text clustering framework, called Reliable \textbf{P}seudo-labeling via \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport with \textbf{A}ttention for Short Text Clustering (\textbf{POTA}), that generate reliable pseudo-labels to aid discriminative representation learning for clustering. Specially, \textbf{POTA} first implements an instance-level attention mechanism to capture the semantic relationships among samples, which are then incorporated as a semantic consistency regularization term into an optimal transport problem. By solving this OT problem, we can yield reliable pseudo-labels that simultaneously account for sample-to-sample semantic consistency and sample-to-cluster global structure information. Additionally, the proposed OT can adaptively estimate cluster distributions, making \textbf{POTA} well-suited for varying degrees of imbalanced datasets. Then, we utilize the pseudo-labels to guide contrastive learning to generate discriminative representations and achieve efficient clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate \textbf{POTA} outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
