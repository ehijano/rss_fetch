      <title>Latent geometry emerging from network-driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding network functionality requires integrating structure and dynamics, and emergent latent geometry induced by network-driven processes captures the low-dimensional spaces governing this interplay. Here, we focus on generative-model-based approaches, distinguishing two reconstruction classes: fixed-time methods, which infer geometry at specific temporal scales (e.g., equilibrium), and multi-scale methods, which integrate dynamics across near- and far-from-equilibrium scales. Over the past decade, these models have revealed functional organization in biological, social, and technological networks.</description>

      <title>Milgram's experiment in the knowledge space: Individual navigation strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data deluge characteristic for our times has led to information overload, posing a significant challenge to effectively finding our way through the digital landscape. Addressing this issue requires an in-depth understanding of how we navigate through the abundance of information. Previous research has discovered multiple patterns in how individuals navigate in the geographic, social, and information spaces, yet individual differences in strategies for navigation in the knowledge space has remained largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, we conducted an online experiment where participants played a navigation game on Wikipedia and completed questionnaires about their personal information. Utilizing the hierarchical structure of the English Wikipedia and a graph embedding trained on it, we identified two navigation strategies and found that there are significant individual differences in the choices of them. Older, white and female participants tend to adopt a proximity-driven strategy, while younger participants prefer a hub-driven strategy. Our study connects social navigation to knowledge navigation: individuals' differing tendencies to use geographical and occupational information about the target person to navigate in the social space can be understood as different choices between the hub-driven and proximity-driven strategies in the knowledge space.</description>

      <title>Correlations in Motion: A Simple Response-Based Analysis of Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why does a traffic jams form out of nowhere, and why does it stretch for kilometers even after the initial cause is passed? This study examines how congestion moves and spreads across motorways using a surprisingly simple method: response functions. These functions are based purely on data and show how changes in traffic flow, density, and velocity are connected over time and space. Using real-world data from German motorways, we track how traffic reacts to earlier disturbances, capturing the waves of slowing and accelerating that drivers experience in stop-and-go traffic. The results demonstrate how congestion propagates and how its rhythm can be measured and predicted. Unlike complex traffic models, this approach requires no simulations or assumptions about driver behavior. It works directly from the information provided by the road. The goal is clear: to understand congestion better so that we can manage it more effectively and perhaps spend less time stuck in it.</description>

      <title>Human-Agent Interaction in Synthetic Social Networks: A Framework for Studying Online Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public discourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and risks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>The increasing fragmentation of global science limits the diffusion of ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global science is often portrayed as a unified system of shared knowledge and open exchange. Yet this vision contrasts with emerging evidence that scientific recognition is uneven and increasingly fragmented along regional and cultural lines. Traditional models emphasize Western dominance in knowledge production but overlook regional dynamics, reinforcing a core-periphery narrative that sustains disparities and marginalizes less prominent countries. In this study, we introduce a rank-based signed measure of national citation preferences, enabling the construction of a global recognition network that distinguishes over- and under-recognition between countries. Using a multinomial logistic link prediction model, we assess how economic, cultural, and scientific variables shape the presence and direction of national citation preferences. We uncover a global structure composed of multiple scientific communities, characterized by strong internal citation preferences and negative preferences between them-revealing growing fragmentation in the international scientific system. A separate weighted logistic regression framework suggests that this network significantly influences the international diffusion of scientific ideas, even after controlling for common covariates. Together, these findings highlight the structural barriers to equitable recognition and underscore the importance of scientific community membership in shaping influence, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to foster inclusive and impactful global science.</description>
