      <title>Watch the Watcher! Backdoor Attacks on Security-Enhancing Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to their remarkable denoising capabilities, diffusion models are increasingly being employed as defensive tools to reinforce the security of other models, notably in purifying adversarial examples and certifying adversarial robustness. However, the security risks of these practices themselves remain largely unexplored, which is highly concerning. To bridge this gap, this work investigates the vulnerabilities of security-enhancing diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that these models are highly susceptible to DIFF2, a simple yet effective backdoor attack, which substantially diminishes the security assurance provided by such models. Essentially, DIFF2 achieves this by integrating a malicious diffusion-sampling process into the diffusion model, guiding inputs embedded with specific triggers toward an adversary-defined distribution while preserving the normal functionality for clean inputs. Our case studies on adversarial purification and robustness certification show that DIFF2 can significantly reduce both post-purification and certified accuracy across benchmark datasets and models, highlighting the potential risks of relying on pre-trained diffusion models as defensive tools. We further explore possible countermeasures, suggesting promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Quantification of Non-IID Degree in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving approach to machine learning for multiple collaborators without sharing raw data. However, the existence of non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) datasets across different clients presents a significant challenge to FL, leading to a sharp drop in accuracy, reduced efficiency, and hindered implementation. To address the non-IID problem, various methods have been proposed, including clustering and personalized FL frameworks. Nevertheless, to date, a formal quantitative definition of the non-IID degree between different clients' datasets is still missing, hindering the clients from comparing and obtaining an overview of their data distributions with other clients. For the first time, this paper proposes a quantitative definition of the non-IID degree in the federated environment by employing the cumulative distribution function (CDF), called Fully Homomorphic Encryption-based Federated Cumulative Distribution Function (FHE-FCDF). This method utilizes cryptographic primitive fully homomorphic encryption to enable clients to estimate the non-IID degree while ensuring privacy preservation. The experiments conducted on the CIFAR-100 non-IID dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Speed-up of Data Analysis with Kernel Trick in Encrypted Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) is pivotal for secure computation on encrypted data, crucial in privacy-preserving data analysis. However, efficiently processing high-dimensional data in HE, especially for machine learning and statistical (ML/STAT) algorithms, poses a challenge. In this paper, we present an effective acceleration method using the kernel method for HE schemes, enhancing time performance in ML/STAT algorithms within encrypted domains. This technique, independent of underlying HE mechanisms and complementing existing optimizations, notably reduces costly HE multiplications, offering near constant time complexity relative to data dimension. Aimed at accessibility, this method is tailored for data scientists and developers with limited cryptography background, facilitating advanced data analysis in secure environments.</description>

      <title>Deobfuscation of Semi-Linear Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation is a common technique used to transform simple expressions into semantically equivalent but more complex combinations of boolean and arithmetic operators. Its widespread usage in DRM systems, malware, and software protectors is well documented.
  In 2021, Liu et al. proposed a groundbreaking method of simplifying linear MBAs, utilizing a hidden two-way transformation between 1-bit and n-bit variables. In 2022, Reichenwallner et al. proposed a similar but more effective method of simplifying linear MBAs, SiMBA, relying on a similar but more involved theorem. However, because current linear MBA simplifiers operate in 1-bit space, they cannot handle expressions which utilize constants inside of their bitwise operands, e.g. (x&amp;1), (x&amp;1111) + (y&amp;1111).
  We propose an extension to SiMBA that enables simplification of this broader class of expressions. It surpasses peer tools, achieving efficient simplification of a class of MBAs that current simplifiers struggle with.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Security in Millimeter Wave SWIPT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication encounters a major issue of extremely high power consumption. To address this problem, the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) could be a promising technology. The mmWave frequencies are more appropriate for the SWIPT comparing to current low-frequency wireless transmissions, since mmWave base stations (BSs) can pack with large antenna arrays to achieve significant array gains and high-speed short-distance transmissions. Unfortunately, the implementation of SWIPT in the wireless communication may lead to an expanded defencelessness against the eavesdropping due to high transmission power and data spillage. It is conventionally believed that narrow beam offers inherent information-theoretic security against the eavesdropping, because only the eavesdroppers, which rely on the line-of-sight path between the legitimate transmitter and receiver, can receive strong enough signals. However, some mmWave experiments have shown that even by using highly directional mmWaves, the reflection signals caused by objects in the environment can be beneficial to the eavesdroppers. This paper studies the security performance in general mmWave SWIPT networks, and investigates the probability of successful eavesdropping under different attack models. Analytical expressions of eavesdropping success probability (ESP) of both independent and colluding eavesdroppers are derived by incorporating the random reflection paths in the environment. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal the effects of some key parameters on the ESP, such as the time switching strategy in SWIPT, densities of mmWave BSs, and carriers frequencies, etc. Based on the numerical and simulation results, some design suggestions of mmWave SWIPT are provided to defend against eavesdropping attacks and achieve secure communication in practice.</description>

      <title>LooPIN: A PinFi protocol for decentralized computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked computing power is a critical utility in the era of artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel Physical Infrastructure Finance (PinFi) protocol designed to facilitate the distribution of computing power within networks in a decentralized manner. Addressing the core challenges of coordination, pricing, and liquidity in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), the PinFi protocol introduces a distinctive dynamic pricing mechanism. It enables providers to allocate excess computing resources to a "dissipative" PinFi liquidity pool, distinct from traditional DeFi liquidity pools, ensuring seamless access for clients at equitable, market-based prices. This approach significantly reduces the costs of accessing computing power, potentially to as low as 1% compared to existing services, while simultaneously enhancing security and dependability. The PinFi protocol is poised to transform the dynamics of supply and demand in computing power networks, setting a new standard for efficiency and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Is Diffusion Model Safe? Severe Data Leakage via Gradient-Guided Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient leakage has been identified as a potential source of privacy breaches in modern image processing systems, where the adversary can completely reconstruct the training images from leaked gradients. However, existing methods are restricted to reconstructing low-resolution images where data leakage risks of image processing systems are not sufficiently explored. In this paper, by exploiting diffusion models, we propose an innovative gradient-guided fine-tuning method and introduce a new reconstruction attack that is capable of stealing private, high-resolution images from image processing systems through leaked gradients where severe data leakage encounters. Our attack method is easy to implement and requires little prior knowledge. The experimental results indicate that current reconstruction attacks can steal images only up to a resolution of $128 \times 128$ pixels, while our attack method can successfully recover and steal images with resolutions up to $512 \times 512$ pixels. Our attack method significantly outperforms the SOTA attack baselines in terms of both pixel-wise accuracy and time efficiency of image reconstruction. Furthermore, our attack can render differential privacy ineffective to some extent.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Comparative Analysis of Intrusion Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become a widely discussed topic, the related technologies facilitate better understanding of conventional black-box models like Random Forest, Neural Networks and etc. However, domain-specific applications of XAI are still insufficient. To fill this gap, this research analyzes various machine learning models to the tasks of binary and multi-class classification for intrusion detection from network traffic on the same dataset using occlusion sensitivity. The models evaluated include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). We trained all models to the accuracy of 90\% on the UNSW-NB15 Dataset. We found that most classifiers leverage only less than three critical features to achieve such accuracies, indicating that effective feature engineering could actually be far more important for intrusion detection than applying complicated models. We also discover that Random Forest provides the best performance in terms of accuracy, time efficiency and robustness.

      <title>Robustness-Inspired Defense Against Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising results in tasks such as node classification and graph classification. However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing a significant threat to their real-world adoption. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, there is no work on defending against various types of backdoor attacks where generated triggers have different properties. Hence, we first empirically verify that prediction variance under edge dropping is a crucial indicator for identifying poisoned nodes. With this observation, we propose using random edge dropping to detect backdoors and theoretically show that it can efficiently distinguish poisoned nodes from clean ones. Furthermore, we introduce a novel robust training strategy to efficiently counteract the impact of the triggers. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our framework can effectively identify poisoned nodes, significantly degrade the attack success rate, and maintain clean accuracy when defending against various types of graph backdoor attacks with different properties.</description>

      <title>Beyond Slow Signs in High-fidelity Model Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks, costly to train and rich in intellectual property value, are increasingly threatened by model extraction attacks that compromise their confidentiality. Previous attacks have succeeded in reverse-engineering model parameters up to a precision of float64 for models trained on random data with at most three hidden layers using cryptanalytical techniques. However, the process was identified to be very time consuming and not feasible for larger and deeper models trained on standard benchmarks. Our study evaluates the feasibility of parameter extraction methods of Carlini et al. [1] further enhanced by Canales-Mart\'inez et al. [2] for models trained on standard benchmarks. We introduce a unified codebase that integrates previous methods and reveal that computational tools can significantly influence performance. We develop further optimisations to the end-to-end attack and improve the efficiency of extracting weight signs by up to 14.8 times compared to former methods through the identification of easier and harder to extract neurons. Contrary to prior assumptions, we identify extraction of weights, not extraction of weight signs, as the critical bottleneck. With our improvements, a 16,721 parameter model with 2 hidden layers trained on MNIST is extracted within only 98 minutes compared to at least 150 minutes previously. Finally, addressing methodological deficiencies observed in previous studies, we propose new ways of robust benchmarking for future model extraction attacks.</description>

      <title>SmartOracle: Generating Smart Contract Oracle via Fine-Grained Invariant Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As decentralized applications (DApps) proliferate, the increased complexity and usage of smart contracts have heightened their susceptibility to security incidents and financial losses. Although various vulnerability detection tools have been developed to mitigate these issues, they often suffer poor performance in detecting vulnerabilities, as they either rely on simplistic and general-purpose oracles that may be inadequate for vulnerability detection, or require user-specified oracles, which are labor-intensive to create. In this paper, we introduce SmartOracle, a dynamic invariant detector that automatically generates fine-grained invariants as application-specific oracles for vulnerability detection. From historical transactions, SmartOracle uses pattern-based detection and advanced inference to construct comprehensive properties, and mines multi-layer likely invariants to accommodate the complicated contract functionalities. After that, SmartOracle identifies smart contract vulnerabilities by hunting the violated invariants in new transactions. In the field of invariant detection, SmartOracle detects 50% more ERC20 invariants than existing dynamic invariant detection and achieves 96% precision rate. Furthermore, we build a dataset that contains vulnerable contracts from real-world security incidents. SmartOracle successfully detects 466 abnormal transactions with an acceptable precision rate 96%, involving 31 vulnerable contracts. The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities, especially those related to complicated contract functionalities.</description>

      <title>Understanding Large Language Model Based Fuzz Driver Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based (Large Language Model) fuzz driver generation is a promising research area. Unlike traditional program analysis-based method, this text-based approach is more general and capable of harnessing a variety of API usage information, resulting in code that is friendly for human readers. However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the fundamental issues on this direction, such as its effectiveness and potential challenges.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first in-depth study targeting the important issues of using LLMs to generate effective fuzz drivers. Our study features a curated dataset with 86 fuzz driver generation questions from 30 widely-used C projects. Six prompting strategies are designed and tested across five state-of-the-art LLMs with five different temperature settings. In total, our study evaluated 736,430 generated fuzz drivers, with 0.85 billion token costs ($8,000+ charged tokens). Additionally, we compared the LLM-generated drivers against those utilized in industry, conducting extensive fuzzing experiments (3.75 CPU-year). Our study uncovered that: - While LLM-based fuzz driver generation is a promising direction, it still encounters several obstacles towards practical applications; - LLMs face difficulties in generating effective fuzz drivers for APIs with intricate specifics. Three featured design choices of prompt strategies can be beneficial: issuing repeat queries, querying with examples, and employing an iterative querying process; - While LLM-generated drivers can yield fuzzing outcomes that are on par with those used in the industry, there are substantial opportunities for enhancement, such as extending contained API usage, or integrating semantic oracles to facilitate logical bug detection.
  Our insights have been implemented to improve the OSS-Fuzz-Gen project, facilitating practical fuzz driver generation in industry.</description>

      <title>"Did They F***ing Consent to That?": Safer Digital Intimacy via Proactive Protection Against Image-Based Sexual Abuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As many as 8 in 10 adults share intimate content such as nude or lewd images. Sharing such content has significant benefits for relationship intimacy and body image, and can offer employment. However, stigmatizing attitudes and a lack of technological mitigations put those sharing such content at risk of sexual violence. An estimated 1 in 3 people have been subjected to image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), a spectrum of violence that includes the nonconsensual distribution or threat of distribution of consensually-created intimate content (also called NDII). In this work, we conducted a rigorous empirical interview study of 52 European creators of intimate content to examine the threats they face and how they defend against them, situated in the context of their different use cases for intimate content sharing and their choice of technologies for storing and sharing such content. Synthesizing our results with the limited body of prior work on technological prevention of NDII, we offer concrete next steps for both platforms and security &amp; privacy researchers to work toward safer intimate content sharing through proactive protection.
  Content Warning: This work discusses sexual violence, specifically, the harms of image-based sexual abuse (particularly in Sections 2 and 6).</description>

      <title>Inferring State Machine from the Protocol Implementation via Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State machines play a pivotal role in augmenting the efficacy of protocol analyzing to unveil more vulnerabilities. However, the task of inferring state machines from network protocol implementations presents significant challenges. Traditional methods based on dynamic analysis often overlook crucial state transitions due to limited coverage, while static analysis faces difficulties with complex code structures and behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative state machine inference approach powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Utilizing text-embedding technology, this method allows LLMs to dissect and analyze the intricacies of protocol implementation code. Through targeted prompt engineering, we systematically identify and infer the underlying state machines. Our evaluation across six protocol implementations demonstrates the method's high efficacy, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 90% and successfully delineating differences on state machines among various implementations of the same protocol. Importantly, integrating this approach with protocol fuzzing has notably enhanced AFLNet's code coverage by 10% over RFCNLP, showcasing the considerable potential of LLMs in advancing network protocol security analysis. Our proposed method not only marks a significant step forward in accurate state machine inference but also opens new avenues for improving the security and reliability of protocol implementations.</description>

Abstract: Complex multi-step attacks have caused significant damage to numerous critical infrastructures. To detect such attacks, graph neural network based methods have shown promising results by modeling the system's events as a graph. However, existing methods still face several challenges when deployed in practice. First, there is a lack of sufficient real attack data especially considering the large volume of normal data. Second, the modeling of event graphs is challenging due to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature. Third, the lack of explanation in learning models undermines the trustworthiness of such methods in production environments. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose an attack detection method, Trace2Vec. The approach first designs an erosion function to augment rare attack samples, and integrates them into the event graphs. Next, it models the event graphs via a continuous-time dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network. Finally, it employs the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to identify events with greater contributions to the attack, thus enhancing the explainability of the detection result. We have implemented a prototype for Trace2Vec, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its superior detection and explanation performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Shesha: Multi-head Microarchitectural Leakage Discovery in new-generation Intel Processors</title>

Abstract: Transient execution attacks have been one of the widely explored microarchitectural side channels since the discovery of Spectre and Meltdown. However, much of the research has been driven by manual discovery of new transient paths through well-known speculative events. Although a few attempts exist in literature on automating transient leakage discovery, such tools focus on finding variants of known transient attacks and explore a small subset of instruction set. Further, they take a random fuzzing approach that does not scale as the complexity of search space increases. In this work, we identify that the search space of bad speculation is disjointedly fragmented into equivalence classes, and then use this observation to develop a framework named Shesha, inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization, which exhibits faster convergence rates than state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques for automatic discovery of transient execution attacks. We then use Shesha to explore the vast search space of extensions to the x86 Instruction Set Architecture (ISAs), thereby focusing on previously unexplored avenues of bad speculation. As such, we report five previously unreported transient execution paths in Instruction Set Extensions (ISEs) on new generation of Intel processors. We then perform extensive reverse engineering of each of the transient execution paths and provide root-cause analysis. Using the discovered transient execution paths, we develop attack building blocks to exhibit exploitable transient windows. Finally, we demonstrate data leakage from Fused Multiply-Add instructions through SIMD buffer and extract victim data from various cryptographic implementations.</description>

      <title>VulDetectBench: Evaluating the Deep Capability of Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have training corpora containing large amounts of program code, greatly improving the model's code comprehension and generation capabilities. However, sound comprehensive research on detecting program vulnerabilities, a more specific task related to code, and evaluating the performance of LLMs in this more specialized scenario is still lacking. To address common challenges in vulnerability analysis, our study introduces a new benchmark, VulDetectBench, specifically designed to assess the vulnerability detection capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates LLM's ability to identify, classify, and locate vulnerabilities through five tasks of increasing difficulty. We evaluate the performance of 17 models (both open- and closed-source) and find that while existing models can achieve over 80% accuracy on tasks related to vulnerability identification and classification, they still fall short on specific, more detailed vulnerability analysis tasks, with less than 30% accuracy, making it difficult to provide valuable auxiliary information for professional vulnerability mining. Our benchmark effectively evaluates the capabilities of various LLMs at different levels in the specific task of vulnerability detection, providing a foundation for future research and improvements in this critical area of code security. VulDetectBench is publicly available at https://github.com/Sweetaroo/VulDetectBench.</description>

      <title>LLAMAFUZZ: Large Language Model Enhanced Greybox Fuzzing</title>

Abstract: Greybox fuzzing has achieved success in revealing bugs and vulnerabilities in programs. However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data. Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput.
  In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data. We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs. We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively. Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing. We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials. Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached. Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</description>

      <title>Quantum Merkle Trees</title>

Abstract: Committing to information is a central task in cryptography, where a party (typically called a prover) stores a piece of information (e.g., a bit string) with the promise of not changing it. This information can be accessed by another party (typically called the verifier), who can later learn the information and verify that it was not meddled with. Merkle trees are a well-known construction for doing so in a succinct manner, in which the verifier can learn any part of the information by receiving a short proof from the honest prover. Despite its significance in classical cryptography, there was no quantum analog of the Merkle tree. A direct generalization using the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM) does not seem to be secure. In this work, we propose the quantum Merkle tree. It is based on what we call the Quantum Haar Random Oracle Model (QHROM). In QHROM, both the prover and the verifier have access to a Haar random quantum oracle $G$ and its inverse.
  Using the quantum Merkle tree, we propose a succinct quantum argument for the Gap-$k$-Local-Hamiltonian problem. Assuming the Quantum PCP conjecture is true, this succinct argument extends to all of QMA. This work raises a number of interesting open research problems.</description>

      <title>A robust statistical framework for cyber-vulnerability prioritisation under partial information in threat intelligence</title>

Abstract: Proactive cyber-risk assessment is gaining momentum due to the wide range of sectors that can benefit from the prevention of cyber-incidents by preserving integrity, confidentiality, and the availability of data. The rising attention to cybersecurity also results from the increasing connectivity of cyber-physical systems, which generates multiple sources of uncertainty about emerging cyber-vulnerabilities. This work introduces a robust statistical framework for quantitative and qualitative reasoning under uncertainty about cyber-vulnerabilities and their prioritisation. Specifically, we take advantage of mid-quantile regression to deal with ordinal risk assessments, and we compare it to current alternatives for cyber-risk ranking and graded responses. For this purpose, we identify a novel accuracy measure suited for rank invariance under partial knowledge of the whole set of existing vulnerabilities. The model is tested on both simulated and real data from selected databases that support the evaluation, exploitation, or response to cyber-vulnerabilities in realistic contexts. Such datasets allow us to compare multiple models and accuracy measures, discussing the implications of partial knowledge about cyber-vulnerabilities on threat intelligence and decision-making in operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>LUNA: A Model-Based Universal Analysis Framework for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Over the past decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had great success recently and is being used in a wide range of academic and industrial fields. More recently, LLMs have made rapid advancements that have propelled AI to a new level, enabling even more diverse applications and industrial domains with intelligence, particularly in areas like software engineering and natural language processing. Nevertheless, a number of emerging trustworthiness concerns and issues exhibited in LLMs have already recently received much attention, without properly solving which the widespread adoption of LLMs could be greatly hindered in practice. The distinctive characteristics of LLMs, such as the self-attention mechanism, extremely large model scale, and autoregressive generation schema, differ from classic AI software based on CNNs and RNNs and present new challenges for quality analysis. Up to the present, it still lacks universal and systematic analysis techniques for LLMs despite the urgent industrial demand. Towards bridging this gap, we initiate an early exploratory study and propose a universal analysis framework for LLMs, LUNA, designed to be general and extensible, to enable versatile analysis of LLMs from multiple quality perspectives in a human-interpretable manner. In particular, we first leverage the data from desired trustworthiness perspectives to construct an abstract model as an auxiliary analysis asset, which is empowered by various abstract model construction methods. To assess the quality of the abstract model, we collect and define a number of evaluation metrics, aiming at both abstract model level and the semantics level. Then, the semantics, which is the degree of satisfaction of the LLM w.r.t. the trustworthiness perspective, is bound to and enriches the abstract model with semantics, which enables more detailed analysis applications for diverse purposes.</description>

      <title>Disparate Impact on Group Accuracy of Linearization for Private Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring privacy-preserving inference on cryptographically secure data is a well-known computational challenge. To alleviate the bottleneck of costly cryptographic computations in non-linear activations, recent methods have suggested linearizing a targeted portion of these activations in neural networks. This technique results in significantly reduced runtimes with often negligible impacts on accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that such computational benefits may lead to increased fairness costs. Specifically, we find that reducing the number of ReLU activations disproportionately decreases the accuracy for minority groups compared to majority groups. To explain these observations, we provide a mathematical interpretation under restricted assumptions about the nature of the decision boundary, while also showing the prevalence of this problem across widely used datasets and architectures. Finally, we show how a simple procedure altering the fine-tuning step for linearized models can serve as an effective mitigation strategy.</description>

      <title>Secure Aggregation is Not Private Against Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure aggregation (SecAgg) is a commonly-used privacy-enhancing mechanism in federated learning, affording the server access only to the aggregate of model updates while safeguarding the confidentiality of individual updates. Despite widespread claims regarding SecAgg's privacy-preserving capabilities, a formal analysis of its privacy is lacking, making such presumptions unjustified. In this paper, we delve into the privacy implications of SecAgg by treating it as a local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism for each local update. We design a simple attack wherein an adversarial server seeks to discern which update vector a client submitted, out of two possible ones, in a single training round of federated learning under SecAgg. By conducting privacy auditing, we assess the success probability of this attack and quantify the LDP guarantees provided by SecAgg. Our numerical results unveil that, contrary to prevailing claims, SecAgg offers weak privacy against membership inference attacks even in a single training round. Indeed, it is difficult to hide a local update by adding other independent local updates when the updates are of high dimension. Our findings underscore the imperative for additional privacy-enhancing mechanisms, such as noise injection, in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Perturbing Attention Gives You More Bang for the Buck: Subtle Imaging Perturbations That Efficiently Fool Customized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) embark a new era of generative modeling and offer more opportunities for efficient generating high-quality and realistic data samples. However, their widespread use has also brought forth new challenges in model security, which motivates the creation of more effective adversarial attackers on DMs to understand its vulnerability. We propose CAAT, a simple but generic and efficient approach that does not require costly training to effectively fool latent diffusion models (LDMs). The approach is based on the observation that cross-attention layers exhibits higher sensitivity to gradient change, allowing for leveraging subtle perturbations on published images to significantly corrupt the generated images. We show that a subtle perturbation on an image can significantly impact the cross-attention layers, thus changing the mapping between text and image during the fine-tuning of customized diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAAT is compatible with diverse diffusion models and outperforms baseline attack methods in a more effective (more noise) and efficient (twice as fast as Anti-DreamBooth and Mist) manner.</description>
