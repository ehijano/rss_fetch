      <title>Lakeplace: Sensing interactions between lakes and human activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02289v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban freshwater ecosystems, composed of rivers, ponds, lakes, and other water bodies, have essential socioeconomic and ecological values for urban residents. However, research investigating how individuals interact with lakes remains limited, especially within cities and at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To fill this gap, we propose a data-driven analytical framework that comprehensively senses human-lake interactions and profiles the social-demographic characteristics of intra-city lakes. The term "lakeplace" is proposed to depict a place containing lakes and human activities within it. For each lake, the geographic boundary of its lakeplace refers to the first-order administrative units, reflecting the neighboring scale of lake socioeconomics. Utilizing large-scale individual mobile positioning data, we performed lakeplace sensing on the 2,036 major lakes in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA), Minnesota, and the people interacting with them. The popularity of each lakeplace was measured by its temporal visitations and further categorized as on-lake and around-lake human activities. Popular lakeplaces were investigated to depict whether the attractiveness of a lake is mostly brought by the lake itself, or the social-demographic environment around it. The lakeplace sensing framework offers a practical approach to the spatiotemporal characteristics of human activities and understanding the social-demographic knowledge related to human-lake systems. Our work exemplifies the social sensing of human-environment interactions via geospatial big data, shedding light on human-oriented sustainable urban planning and urban water resource management.</description>

      <title>Optimally accurate operators for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we generalize the concept of \textit{optimally accurate operators} proposed and used in a series of studies on the simulation of seismic wave propagation, particularly based on Geller \&amp; Takeuchi (1995). Although these operators have been mathematically and numerically proven to be more accurate than conventional methods, the theory was specifically developed for the equations of motion in linear elastic continuous media. Furthermore, the original theory requires compensation for errors from each term due to truncation at low orders during the error estimation, which has limited its application to other types of physics described by partial differential equations.
  Here, we present a new method that can automatically derive numerical operators for arbitrary partial differential equations. These operators, which involve a small number of nodes in time and space (compact operators), are more accurate than conventional ones and do not require meshing. Our method evaluates the weak formulation of the equations of motion, developed with the aid of Taylor expansions.
  We establish the link between our new method and the classic optimally accurate operators, showing that they produce identical coefficients in homogeneous media. Finally, we perform a benchmark test for the 1D Poisson problem across various heterogeneous media. The benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to conventional operators, even when using a set of linear B-spline test functions (three-point hat functions). However, the convergence rate can depend on the wavelength of the material property: when the material property has the same wavelength as that of the field, the convergence rate is O(4), whereas it can be less efficient O(2) for other models.</description>

      <title>FASTDASH: An Implementation of 3D Earthquake Cycle Simulation on Complex Fault Systems Using the Boundary Element Method Accelerated by H-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault systems have geometrically complex structures in nature, such as stepovers, bends, branches, and roughness. Many geological and geophysical studies have shown that the geometrical complexity of fault systems in nature decisively influences the initiation, arrest, and recurrence of seismic and aseismic events. However, a vast majority of models of slip dynamics are conducted on planar faults due to algorithmic limitations. We develop a 3D quasi-dynamic slip dynamics model to overcome this restriction. The calculation of the elastic response due to slip is a matrix-vector multiplication in boundary element method, which can be accelerated by using hierarchical matrices. The computational complexity is reduced from the order of O(N^2) to O(N log N), where N is the number of degree of freedoms used. We validate our code with a static crack analytical solution and the SEAS benchmark/validation exercise from Southern California Earthquake Center. We further employ this method on a realistic fault system with complex geometry that was reactivated during the 2023 Kahramanmaras - Turkiye doublet earthquakes, generating slip sequences that closely match real observations.</description>

      <title>Earths composition: origin, evolution and energy budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02641v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One in every two atoms in the Earth, Mars, and the Moon is oxygen; it is the third most abundant element in the solar system. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets are different from those of the Sun and demonstrate that these planets are not direct compositional analogs of the solar photosphere. Likewise, the Suns O/Fe, Fe/Mg and Mg/Si values are distinct from those of inner solar system chondrites and terrestrial planets. These four elements (O, Fe, Mg, Si) make up about 94% by mass of the rocky planets and their abundances are determined uniquely using geophysical, geochemical and cosmochemical constraints. The rocky planets grew rapidly from planetesimals, most of which were differentiated, having a core and a mantle, before being accreted. Planetary growth in the early stages of protoplanetary disk evolution was rapid and was only partially recorded by the meteoritic record. The noncarbonaceous meteorites (NC) provide insights into the early history of the inner solar system and are used to construct a framework for how the rocky planets were assembled. NC chondrites have chondrule ages that are two to three million years younger than t_zero (the age of calcium-aluminum inclusions, CAI), documenting that chondrites are middle- to late-stage products of solar system evolution. The composition of the Earth, its current form of mantle convection, and the amount of radiogenic power that drives its engine remain controversial topics. Earths dynamics are driven by primordial and radiogenic heat sources. Measurement of the Earths geoneutrino flux defines its radiogenic power and restricts its bulk composition. Using the latest data from the KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino experiments affirms that the Earth has 20 TW of radiogenic power and sets the proportions of refractory lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth at 2.5 to 2.7 times that in CI chondrites.</description>

      <title>Ekman Theory with Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed Ekman spirals in the ocean are always "flatter" than that predicted by the classic theory. We propose that the universal flattening of Ekman spiral is mainly due to the damping associated with turbulent dissipation. Analytical solutions and numerical simulations show convincingly a better fitting between the new theory and observations. Most importantly, the new theory indicates that the damping can lead to weakened Ekman transport and pumping, with the latter not only driven by the curl but also the divergence of wind stress. Under a modest damping, the Ekman transport along 26.5{\deg}N will be ~0.4 Sv (12%) smaller than that predicted by the classic theory. Hence, the damping due to turbulent dissipation can noticeably affect the wind-driven circulation in the upper ocean.</description>

      <title>Polarity transitions induced by symmetry-breaking outer boundary heat flux in rapidly rotating dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates, analytically and numerically, the role of an equatorially anti-symmetric lateral variation in heat flux at the outer boundary in polarity transitions in rapidly rotating dynamos. In an unstably stratified fluid, the frequencies of vertical and horizontal (lateral) buoyancy complement each other such that a polarity transition is induced by the boundary anti-symmetry through the suppression of the slow magnetic-Archimedean-Coriolis (MAC) waves at relatively small vertical buoyant forcing. A dipole-dominated dynamo in the low-inertia limit transitions to polarity reversing and multipolar states in succession as the relative intensity of horizontal buoyancy is progressively increased for a fixed vertical buoyancy. In the same parameter space, an equatorially symmetric heat flux variation does not induce a polarity transition. A composite boundary heterogeneity consisting of comparable magnitudes of symmetric and anti-symmetric variations induces the polarity transition at a horizontal buoyancy of the same order as that for the transition induced by a purely anti-symmetric variation. This makes the analysis relevant to Earth's core, which convects in response to a composite heat flux variation in the lowermost mantle. A heterogeneity with a dominant symmetric part inhibits polarity transitions, likely producing long periods in Earth's history without reversals. The fact that compositional buoyancy is much stronger than thermal buoyancy, together with the known order of magnitude of the peak field intensity in the inertia-free limit, indicates that the core can operate under a large lower-mantle heat flux heterogeneity, of O(10) times the mean heat flux at the core--mantle boundary.</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the "return stroke"-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed `Main pulse' shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component-type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a unique mode of charge transfer with a range of junction length-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>
