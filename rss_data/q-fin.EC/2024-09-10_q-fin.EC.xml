      <title>The Global Minimum Tax, Investment Incentives and Asymmetric Tax Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the OECD's global minimum tax (GMT) affects multinational enterprises (MNEs) behavior and countries' corporate taxes. We consider both profit shifting and capital investment responses of the MNE in a formal model of tax competition between asymmetric countries. The GMT reduces the true tax rate differential and benefits the large country, while the revenue effect is generally ambiguous for the small country. In the short run where tax rates are fixed, due to tax deduction of the substance-based income exclusion (SBIE), a higher minimum rate exerts investment incentives but also incurs a larger revenue loss for the small country. We show that under high (low) profit shifting costs the former (latter) effect dominates so that the small country's revenue increases (decreases). In the long run where countries can adjust tax rates, the GMT reshapes the tax game and the competition pattern. In contrast to the existing literature, we reveal that the minimum rate binds the small country only if it is low. With the rise of the GMT rate, countries will undercut the minimum to boost real investments and collect top-up taxes. For small market-size asymmetry and intermediate profit shifting cost, the revenue loss from the elimination of profit shifting may dominate the revenue gain from taxing the true profits generated by substantive activities, so that even a marginal GMT reform may harm the small country. Otherwise, it can raise the small country's tax revenue.</description>

      <title>Note on solving one-to-one matching models with linear transferable utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a system of fixed-point equations for the equilibrium transfers in a class of one-to-one matching models with linear transferable utility. We then show that, when the degree of substitution between alternatives is bounded from above, the derived system of equations constitutes a contraction mapping. As a result, fixed-point iterations are guaranteed to converge to the unique distribution of equilibrium transfers.</description>

      <title>Climate, Crops, and Postharvest Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16370v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present new evidence of the effects of climate shocks on conflict. Focusing on political violence in Africa, I find that El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) shocks during the crop-growing season affect harvest-related conflict in croplands exposed to this climate phenomenon. Specifically, a 1{\deg}C warming of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean, a proxy for a moderate-strength El Ni\~no event, reduces political violence in exposed locations with crop agriculture, relative to other areas, by approximately three percent, during the early postharvest season. This effect attenuates toward zero as the crop year progresses. This effect can be five times as large after a strong El Ni\~no event, such as that of 1997 or 2015, in highly exposed croplands, such as parts of Southern Africa and the Sahel. Conversely, a La Ni\~na event, which is a counterpart of an El Ni\~no event, has the opposite effect and thus increases conflict in the exposed croplands during the early postharvest season. Because ENSO events can be predicted at least several months in advance, these findings can contribute to creating a platform for early warnings of changes in political violence in predominantly agrarian societies.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Mismatch in Labor Markets via Public Employment Security Offices in Japan, 1972-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine changes in matching efficiency and elasticities in Japan's labor market via Hello Work for unemployed workers from January 1972 to April 2024 using a nonparametric identification approach by y Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). I find a declining trend in matching efficiency, consistent with decreasing job and worker finding rates. The implied match elasticity with respect to unemployment is 0.5-0.9, whereas the implied match elasticity with respect to vacancies varies between -0.4 and 0.4. Decomposing aggregate data into full-time and part-time ones, I find that the sharp decline of matching efficiency after 2015 shown in the aggregate trend is driven by the decline of both full-time and part-time ones. Second, I extend the mismatch index proposed by Sahin et al (2014) to the nonparametric version and develop the computational methodology. I find that the mismatch across occupations is more severe than across prefectures and the original Cobb-Douglas mismatch index is underestimated.</description>

      <title>Has the Recession Started?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To answer this question, we develop a new Sahm-type recession indicator that combines vacancy and unemployment data. The indicator is the minimum of the Sahm indicator -- the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the unemployment rate and its minimum over the past 12 months -- and a similar indicator constructed with the vacancy rate -- the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the vacancy rate and its maximum over the past 12 months. We then propose a two-sided recession rule: When our indicator reaches 0.3pp, a recession may have started; when the indicator reaches 0.8pp, a recession has started for sure. This new rule is triggered earlier than the Sahm rule: on average it detects recessions 0.8 month after they have started, while the Sahm rule detects them 2.1 months after their start. The new rule also has a better historical track record: it perfectly identifies all recessions since 1929, while the Sahm rule breaks down before 1960. With August 2024 data, our indicator is at 0.54pp, so the probability that the US economy is now in recession is 48%. In fact, the recession may have started as early as March 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review article explores the challenges and opportunities faced by the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) in Thailand from a microfinance perspective. It examines the role of BAAC as a specialized financial institution in assisting underprivileged households and small businesses in accessing financial services. The study emphasizes the challenges and opportunities faced by BAAC in promoting sustainable development. It also explores BAAC's role in advancing the BCG Model policy, which fosters sustainability in the agricultural sector through Bio Economy Credit, Circular Economy Credit, and Green Credit. These initiatives support investments in biotechnology, waste reduction (Zero Waste), organic farming, and safe food production, all aimed at enhancing farmers' quality of life, stimulating growth in agriculture, and preserving the environment. Moreover, BAAC remains committed to upholding transparency, fairness, and operational standards.</description>

      <title>An Economic Solution to Copyright Challenges of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained on large data corpora to generate new pieces of text, images, videos, and other media. There is growing concern that such systems may infringe on the copyright interests of training data contributors. To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance. Meanwhile, copyright owners receive fair compensation, driving the continued provision of relevant data for generative model training. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully identifies the most relevant data sources used in artwork generation, ensuring a fair and interpretable distribution of revenues among copyright owners.</description>
