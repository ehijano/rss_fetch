      <title>Purity benchmarking study of error coherence in a single Xmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ purity benchmarking (PB) to explore the dynamics of gate noise in a superconducting qubit system. Over 1110 hours of observations on an Xmon qubit, we simultaneously measure the coherence noise budget across two different operational frequencies. We find that incoherent errors, which predominate in overall error rates, exhibit minimal frequency dependence, suggesting they are primarily due to wide-band, diffusive incoherent error sources. In contrast, coherent errors, although less prevalent, show significant sensitivity to operational frequency variations and telegraphic noise. We speculate that this sensitivity is due to interactions with a single strongly coupled environmental defect -- modeled as a two-level system -- which influences qubit control parameters and causes coherent calibration errors. Our results also demonstrate that PB offers improved sensitivity, capturing additional dynamics that conventional relaxation time measurements cannot detect, thus presenting a more comprehensive method for capturing dynamic interactions within quantum systems. The intricate nature of these coherence dynamics underscores the need for further research.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Binless Multidimensional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Binless Multidimensional Thermodynamic Integration (BMTI) method for nonparametric, robust, and data-efficient density estimation. BMTI estimates the logarithm of the density by initially computing log-density differences between neighbouring data points. Subsequently, such differences are integrated, weighted by their associated uncertainties, using a maximum-likelihood formulation. This procedure can be seen as an extension to a multidimensional setting of the thermodynamic integration, a technique developed in statistical physics. The method leverages the manifold hypothesis, estimating quantities within the intrinsic data manifold without defining an explicit coordinate map. It does not rely on any binning or space partitioning, but rather on the construction of a neighbourhood graph based on an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure. BMTI mitigates the limitations commonly associated with traditional nonparametric density estimators, effectively reconstructing smooth profiles even in high-dimensional embedding spaces. The method is tested on a variety of complex synthetic high-dimensional datasets, where it is shown to outperform traditional estimators, and is benchmarked on realistic datasets from the chemical physics literature.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence: introducing the weighted Bayesian update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent environments is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. Given the practical impossibility of achieving a fully consistent turbulent model and guaranteeing convergence to the correct solution, we propose a method to rank 'many wrong models' and to blend their predictions. We evaluate our weighted Bayesian update algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame, and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the transport of odors in the atmospheric boundary layer. Despite minimal prior information about the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Patterns of link reciprocity in directed, signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the analyses concerning signed networks have focused on the balance theory, hence identifying frustration with undirected, triadic motifs having an odd number of negative edges; much less attention has been paid to their directed counterparts. To fill this gap, we focus on signed, directed connections, with the aim of exploring the notion of frustration in such a context. When dealing with signed, directed edges, frustration is a multi-faceted concept, admitting different definitions at different scales: if we limit ourselves to consider cycles of length two, frustration is related to reciprocity, i.e. the tendency of edges to admit the presence of partners pointing in the opposite direction. As the reciprocity of signed networks is still poorly understood, we adopt a principled approach for its study, defining quantities and introducing models to consistently capture empirical patterns of the kind. In order to quantify the tendency of empirical networks to form either mutualistic or antagonistic cycles of length two, we extend the Exponential Random Graphs framework to binary, directed, signed networks with global and local constraints and, then, compare the empirical abundance of the aforementioned patterns with the one expected under each model. We find that the (directed extension of the) balance theory is not capable of providing a consistent explanation of the patterns characterising the directed, signed networks considered in this work. Although part of the ambiguities can be solved by adopting a coarser definition of balance, our results call for a different theory, accounting for the directionality of edges in a coherent manner. In any case, the evidence that the empirical, signed networks can be highly reciprocated leads us to recommend to explicitly account for the role played by bidirectional dyads in determining frustration at higher levels (e.g. the triadic one).</description>

      <title>Masked Particle Modeling on Sets: Towards Self-Supervised High Energy Physics Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose masked particle modeling (MPM) as a self-supervised method for learning generic, transferable, and reusable representations on unordered sets of inputs for use in high energy physics (HEP) scientific data. This work provides a novel scheme to perform masked modeling based pre-training to learn permutation invariant functions on sets. More generally, this work provides a step towards building large foundation models for HEP that can be generically pre-trained with self-supervised learning and later fine-tuned for a variety of down-stream tasks. In MPM, particles in a set are masked and the training objective is to recover their identity, as defined by a discretized token representation of a pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoder. We study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization, permutation invariance, and ordering. We also study the fine-tuning capability of the model, showing that it can be adapted to tasks such as supervised and weakly supervised jet classification, and that the model can transfer efficiently with small fine-tuning data sets to new classes and new data domains.</description>
