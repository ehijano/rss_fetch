      <title>Logic and Languages of Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study finite higher-dimensional automata (HDAs) from the logical point of view. Languages of HDAs are sets of finite bounded-width interval pomsets with interfaces (iiPoms&lt;=k) closed under order extension. We prove that languages of HDAs are MSO-definable. For the converse, we show that the order extensions of MSO-definable sets of iiPoms&lt;=k are languages of HDAs. As a consequence, unlike the case of all pomsets, order extension of MSO-definable sets of iiPoms&lt;=k is also MSO-definable.</description>

      <title>Mata, a Fast and Simple Finite Automata Library (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mata is a well-engineered automata library written in C++ that offers a unique combination of speed and simplicity. It is meant to serve in applications such as string constraint solving and reasoning about regular expressions, and as a~reference implementation of automata algorithms. Besides basic algorithms for (non)deterministic automata, it implements a fast simulation reduction and antichain-based language inclusion checking. The simplicity allows a straightforward access to the low-level structures, making it relatively easy to extend and modify. Besides the C++ API, the library also implements a Python binding. The library comes with a large benchmark of automata problems collected from relevant applications such as string constraint solving, regular model checking, and reasoning about regular expressions. We show that Mata is on this benchmark significantly faster than all libraries from a wide range of automata libraries we collected. Its usefulness in string constraint solving is demonstrated by the string solver Z3-Noodler, which is based on Mata and outperforms the state of the art in string constraint solving on many standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Effective equation solving, constraints and growth in virtually abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the satisfiability and solutions of group equations when combinatorial, algebraic and language-theoretic constraints are imposed on the solutions. We show that the solutions to equations with length, lexicographic order, abelianisation or context-free constraints added, can be effectively produced in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. Crucially, we translate each of the constraints above into a rational set in an effective way, and so reduce each problem to solving equations with rational constraints, which is decidable and well understood in virtually abelian groups. A byproduct of our results is that the growth series of a virtually abelian group, with respect to any generating set and any weight, is effectively computable. This series is known to be rational by a result of Benson, but his proof is non-constructive.</description>
