      <title>Personalised strategy of allocating social goods in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation underlies many aspects of the evolution of human and animal societies, where cooperators produce social goods to benefit others. Explaining the emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals has become a major research interest in evolutionary dynamics. Previous studies typically use complex networks to capture the interactions between individuals, and assume that cooperators distribute benefits equally to their neighbors. In practice, the distribution of social goods is often non-uniform, and individuals may selectively provide benefits to those they interact with based on their personal preferences. Here, we develop an efficient algorithm to optimize the placement of donation structure in any given network to minimize the threshold for the emergence of cooperation. We find when cooperators allocate the benefits preferentially compared to the traditional settings of donating to all neighbors, cooperation tends to be maximally promoted. Furthermore, the optimal donation structure is strongly disassortative -- the low-degree nodes tend to donate to high-degree ones preferentially and vice versa. Based on this finding, we offer a local heuristic strategy based on degree thresholds for personalizing the allocation of social goods and choosing each cooperator's recipient, which we use to prove its effectiveness in empirical datasets. Our findings advance the understanding of mechanisms for promoting cooperation with strategic allocations of social goods.</description>

      <title>Clustering Does Not Always Imply Latent Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latent space approach to complex networks has revealed fundamental principles and symmetries, enabling geometric methods. However, the conditions under which network topology implies geometricity remain unclear. We provide a mathematical proof and empirical evidence showing that the multiscale self-similarity of complex networks is a crucial factor in implying latent geometry. Using degree-thresholding renormalization, we prove that any random scale-free graph in a $d$-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic manifold is self-similar when interactions are pairwise. Hence, both clustering and self-similarity are required to imply geometricity. Our findings highlight that correlated links can lead to finite clustering without self-similarity, and therefore without inherent latent geometry. The implications are significant for network mapping and ensemble equivalence between graphs and continuous spaces.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Scientific Metrics in High Energy, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of key scientific metrics to evaluate the productivity and impact of research conducted in Latin American countries within the fields of High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (HECAP). Using data from the widely used open-access digital library INSPIRE-HEP, we provide a detailed assessment of the scientific contributions from the continent over the past 70 years. We provide data for the evolution of the overall productivity in the region relative to the rest of the world, comparing the productivity of each country, number of active researchers, number of publications, citations, h-index in total and relative to the population and number of researchers, as well as the productivity and impact compared to the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) invested in research, and the Human Development Index (HDI) of each country. We also analyse collaborations among the different countries, as well as collaborations with the rest of the world. Additionally, we studied the gender gap evolution over the same period. This pioneering analysis, which relies solely on open data, can serve as an essential resource for researchers and policymakers alike. It aims to empower scientists with insights into the significance of their contributions to both regional and global research. Moreover, it provides both researchers and policymakers with critical quantitative data, strengthening their understanding of the progress in scientific productivity over the years to better support scientific endeavours in Latin America.</description>

      <title>Quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcement strategies. We evaluate three approaches: (1) doubling transmission links (bridges) between different communities, (2) adding bypasses around weakly synchronized nodes, and (3) reinforcing edges that trigger the largest cascade failures. We use two different models of the Hungarian high-voltage network. These models are built from the official data provided by the transmission system operator, thus eliminating the assumptions typically used in other studies. The coupling strength distribution of the Hungarian models shows good agreement with our previous works using the European and North American grids.
  Additionally, we examine the occurrence of Braess' paradox, where added transmission capacity unexpectedly reduces overall stability. Our results show that reinforcement through community-based bridge duplication yields the most significant improvements across all parameters. A visual comparison highlights differences between this method and traditional reinforcement approaches. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively compare results of oscillator-based studies with those relying on power system analysis software.
  Characteristic results of line-cut simulations reveal cascade size distributions with fat-tailed decays for medium coupling strengths, while exponential behavior emerges for small and large couplings. The observed exponents are reminiscent of the continuously changing exponents due to Griffiths effects near a hybrid type of phase transition.</description>
