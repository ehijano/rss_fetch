      <title>Accelerating Numerical Relativity with Code Generation: CUDA-enabled Hyperbolic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer, the Einstein Telescope, and LISA, demand highly accurate and extensive gravitational wave (GW) catalogs to faithfully extract physical parameters from observed signals. However, numerical relativity (NR) faces significant challenges in generating these catalogs at the required scale and accuracy on modern computers, as NR codes do not fully exploit modern GPU capabilities. In response, we extend NRPy, a Python-based NR code-generation framework, to develop NRPyEllipticGPU -- a CUDA-optimized elliptic solver tailored for the binary black hole (BBH) initial data problem. NRPyEllipticGPU is the first GPU-enabled elliptic solver in the NR community, supporting a variety of coordinate systems and demonstrating substantial performance improvements on both consumer-grade and HPC-grade GPUs. We show that, when compared to a high-end CPU, NRPyEllipticGPU achieves on a high-end GPU up to a sixteenfold speedup in single precision while increasing double-precision performance by a factor of 2--4. This performance boost leverages the GPU's superior parallelism and memory bandwidth to achieve a compute-bound application and enhancing the overall simulation efficiency. As NRPyEllipticGPU shares the core infrastructure common to NR codes, this work serves as a practical guide for developing full, CUDA-optimized NR codes.</description>

      <title>Growing black-hole hair in nonminimally coupled biscalar gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes offer a unique laboratory for fundamental physics and are crucial for probing theories beyond Einstein's theory of General Relativity. In this paper, we consider 4D effective field theories with scalar fields. We focus on axi-dilaton gravity, a quadratic gravity theory with two kinetically coupled scalar fields, an axion and a dilaton. To evolve these fields around black holes, we introduce Canuda-AxiDil, the first open-source, parameterized numerical relativity code for quadratic and bi-scalar gravity. Using this code, we perform single black hole simulations to show the dynamical formation of axion and dilaton hairs. Through these simulations, we measure the impact of black-hole spin and curvature coupling strength on the axion and dilaton, and show that a kinetic coupling between the fields increases the observed deviations from General Relativity. Furthermore, we simulate the axion and dilaton fields around a binary black hole coalescence demonstrating the growth of axion hair during the inspiral and the production of radiative modes for both fields.</description>

      <title>Revisiting purely kinetic k-essence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a dynamical systems study of the purely kinetic k-essence. Although these models have been studied in the past, a full study of the dynamics in the phase space incorporating the stability conditions for theoretical consistency is lacking. Our results confirm in a very rigorous and clear way that these models i) can not explain in a unified way the dark matter and dark energy components of the cosmic fluid and ii) are not adequate to explain the existing observational evidence, in particular the observed amount of cosmic structure.</description>

      <title>Herrera Complexity and Shadows of Spherically Symmetric Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of complexity factor on the formation of photon spheres for spherically symmetric compact objects. The complexity factor obtained from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann curvature tensor connects the geometric attributes of a compact spherically symmetric gravitating object with its matter inhomogeneity and pressure anisotropy via a scalar term. The novelty of the complexity factor is the inherent simple definition that identifies the evolution of matter tensors inside a given region of space-time. Such identification helps to obtain an equivalence class of gravitating compact objects based on their degree of complexity with zero complexity identified as the simplest system. On the other hand shadows and photon rings have become essential for identifying compact regions of space time characterised by massive gravity. Advanced observational data analysis tools augments the hope for identification of exotic gravitational objects, like the so called ``black hole mimickers" and may serve as testing ground for other gravity theories. In this context we explore how complexity of compact objects (a fundamentally theoretical classification) is connected to the photon ring (an astrophysical observable in the universe) and its stability. We consider zero complexity systems and discuss its significance with respect to (wrt) formation of photon rings and hence shadows.</description>

      <title>Detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background with the space-borne gravitational-wave detector network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is one of the main detection targets for future millihertz space-borne gravitational-wave observatories such as the \ac{LISA}, TianQin, and Taiji. For a single LISA-like detector, a null-channel method was developed to identify the SGWB by integrating data from the A and E channels with a noise-only T channel. However, the noise monitoring channel will not be available if one of the laser interferometer arms fails. By combining these detectors, it will be possible to build detector networks to search for SGWB via cross-correlation analysis.In this work, we developed a Bayesian data analysis method based on \ac{TDI} Michelson-type channel. We then investigate the detectability of the TianQin-LISA detector network for various isotropic SGWB. Assuming a three-month observation, the TianQin-LISA detector network could be able to confidently detect SGWB with energy density as low as $\Omega_{\rm PL} = 6.0 \times 10^{-13}$, $\Omega_{\rm Flat} = 2.0 \times 10^{-12}$ and $\Omega_{\rm SP} = 1.2 \times 10^{-12}$ for power-law, flat and single-peak models, respectively.</description>

      <title>The two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity: anisotropic reduced sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity has been analytically studied in the past within a U($N$) symmetry-reduced sector leading to a cosmological interpretation. In this work we study the simplest non-trivial two-vertex model (with four edges, i.e., $N=4$), using the spinorial formalism and twisted geometries to isolate the degrees of freedom and derive a canonical parametrization. We identify eight geometric parameters describing the polyhedral configurations and four twist angles characterizing the system's dynamics. Going beyond the U($N$) symmetry-reduced sector which can be interpreted as homogeneous and isotropic, we find three additional stable symmetry-reduced sectors: the privileged-direction sector, the bi-twist sector, and the inhomogeneous bi-twist sector. Each sector introduces degrees of anisotropy or inhomogeneity and expand the potential cosmological interpretations of the two-vertex model.</description>

Abstract: The classical world structures borne by spacetimes endowed with torsionful affinities are reviewed. Subsequently, the definition and symmetry properties of a typical pair of Witten curvature spinors for such spacetimes are exhibited along with a comprehensive two-component spinor transcription of Einstein-Cartan's theory. A full description of the correspondence principle that interrelates Einstein-Cartan's theory and general relativity is likewise presented.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Non-Singular Solutions in Effective Theory from Kaluza-Klein Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unimodular theory incorporating the Kaluza-Klein construction in five dimensions leads, after reduction to four dimensions, to a new class of scalar-tensor theory. The vacuum cosmological solutions display a bouncing, non singular behavior. From the four dimensional point of view, the solutions are completely regular. However, the propagation of gravitational waves in this geometry displays the presence of instabilities which reflect some features of the original five dimensional structure. Comparison with a four dimensional quantum model with cosmological constant, which has a similar background behavior, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical features and shadows of quantum Schwarzschild black hole in effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry involving leading one-loop long-distance quantum effects, which arise within the framework of effective field theories of gravity. Our analysis reveals that geodesic trajectories of both massive and massless particles can assume completely different behaviors depending on the sign assumed by the quantum contributions, in spite of their smallness. Moreover, we find that the positions of stable and unstable circular orbits are determined by an algebraic quartic equation, which we solve by developing a straightforward and analytic method. Additionally, we examine black hole shadows and rings by means of two different emission profile models, which account for quantum corrections to the innermost stable circular orbit and photon sphere radii. The Hawking temperature and the entropy of the black hole are also derived. Finally, we draw our conclusions.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high density matter blobs that developed due to fluctuations. We study here such a collapse in the inflationary epoch which has been assumed earlier to form primordial black holes. The potentials for inflation are chosen to be a general polynomial in its scalar field $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$. Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits, dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the inflationary field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) fall within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of Spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry Breaking (SLSB) on Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The SLSB is induced by a time-like Bumblebee vector field which is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. The power spectrum and GW amplitude are computed to investigate how Lorentz violation leaves observable imprints. Our analysis contrasts the Lorentz-violating Bumblebee cosmology with standard cosmology in the context of primordial GW generation. We calculate the GW strain amplitude over frequencies $(10^{-10}~\mathrm{Hz}, 10^4~\mathrm{Hz})$, for a range of the dimensionless Lorentz-violating parameter, $ -10^{-3} \leq l \leq 10^{-4} $, which essentially comes from a slight sensitivity to the equation of state for dark energy. For positive $l$ values, the amplitude of GW shows a mild suppression compared to the standard cosmological scenario ($ l = 0 $). This effect could be observable with detectors like SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO. Conversely, negative $ l $ values amplify the GW amplitude, enhancing detectability by both SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO, as well as by THEIA and DECIGO. Notably, the GW strain amplitude increases by an order of magnitude as $ l $ moves from $0$ to $ -10^{-3} $, improving prospects for detection in high-sensitivity detectors like THEIA and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Memory and supertranslations on plane wave spacetimes: an on-shell perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we revisit the computation of the classical gravitational waveform for a particle moving in a plane wave background using on-shell amplitudes. We emphasize the relationship between gravitational memory and the boundary conditions of external scattering states, which were neglected in previous works. We then provide the first tree-level expression for the waveform that captures all memory effects. The waveform is presented in terms of Synge's world function, with explicit tail terms, and a smooth weak memory limit. We also discuss the choice of BMS frame for the waveform on a plane wave background. In flat space, this corresponds to a choice of soft dressing of the initial state. We show that on a plane wave background, this dressing becomes a supertranslation of the waveform, in addition to a phase shift in the waveshape of the background.</description>

      <title>Matter creation, adiabaticity and phantom behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel cosmological framework that unifies matter creation dynamics with thermodynamic principles. Starting with a single-component fluid characterized by a constant equation of state parameter, $\omega$, we introduce a generalized second law of thermodynamics by considering the entropy associated with the cosmic horizon. Imposing an adiabatic expansion condition uniquely determines the particle creation rate, $\Gamma$, a feature unprecedented in previous matter creation models. This mechanism yields a cosmology featuring phantom-like expansion while relying solely on a single constituent, which can be either a quintessence-like fluid or a non-exotic, non-relativistic dark matter component. Remarkably, this framework avoids the need for exotic physics while providing a consistent explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Our results open new pathways for understanding the interplay between horizon thermodynamics, particle creation, and cosmic evolution, offering fresh insights into the nature of dark energy and its potential thermodynamic origins.</description>

      <title>How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing compact objects in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are promising gravitational-wave (GW) sources for space-based GW detectors. EMRI signals typically have long durations, ranging from several months to several years, necessitating highly accurate GW signal templates for detection. In most waveform models, compact objects in EMRIs are treated as test particles without accounting for their spin, mass quadrupole, or tidal deformation. In this study, we simulate GW signals from EMRIs by incorporating the spin and mass quadrupole moments of the compact objects. We evaluate the accuracy of parameter estimation for these simulated waveforms using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and find that the spin, tidal-induced quadruple, and spin-induced quadruple can all be measured with precision ranging from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$, particularly for a mass ratio of $\sim$$10^{-4}$. Assuming the ``true'' GW signals originate from an extended body inspiraling into a supermassive black hole, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Bayes factors between a test-particle waveform template and our model, which includes the spin and quadrupole of the compact object. Our results show that the spin of compact objects can produce detectable deviations in the waveforms across all object types, while tidal-induced quadrupoles are only significant for white dwarfs, especially in cases approaching an intermediate-mass ratio. Spin-induced quadrupoles, however, have negligible effects on the waveforms. Therefore, our findings suggest that it is possible to distinguish primordial black holes from white dwarfs, and, under certain conditions, neutron stars can also be differentiated from primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of structure growth in the universe with field-fluid interactions through dynamical stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting quintessence dark energy - dark matter scenario and its impact on structure formation by analyzing the evolution of scalar perturbations. The interaction is introduced by incorporating a non-zero source term into the continuity equations of the two sectors (with opposite signs), modeled as $\bar{Q}_0 \equiv \alpha\bar{\rho}_{\rm m}(H + \kappa\dot{\phi})$. The coupling parameter $\alpha$ and the parameter $\lambda$ involved in quintessence potential $V(\phi) = V_0e^{-\lambda\kappa\phi}$, play crucial roles in governing the dynamics of evolution examined within the present framework. The cosmic evolution, within this context, is depicted as a first-order autonomous system of equations involving appropriately chosen dynamical variables. We analyzed the associated stability characteristics and growth rate of perturbations and obtained domains in the ($\alpha-\lambda$) parameter space for which fixed points can exhibit stable and non-phantom accelerating solutions. Depending on its magnitude, the coupling parameter $\alpha$ has the potential to change the characteristics of certain critical points, altering them from attractors to repellers. This model effectively captures the evolutionary features of the universe across its various phases at both the background and perturbation levels. The issue of cosmic coincidence can also be addressed within the framework of this model. We also observed that for a moderate strength of coupling, the growth rate of matter perturbation extends into the distant future.</description>

      <title>The Kramers escape rate of phase transitions for the 6-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole with triple phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we obtain specific picture of the phase transitions for the 6-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole with triple phases, using the generalized free energy we constructed and Kramers escape rate in stochastic motion. There are six possible phase transition processes between the three different stable states (small, medium, and large black hole states). During these phase transitions, there are two key temperatures. One is the temperature at which the medium black hole state emerges, and the other is the temperature at which the small black hole state annihilates. Meanwhile, two dynamic equilibrium processes are formed. One is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the medium black hole state to the large black hole state and the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state. The other is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state and the transition from the medium black hole state to the small black hole state.</description>

      <title>Recovering Injected Astrophysics from the LISA Galactic Double White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the successful recovery of common envelope ejection efficiency assumed in a simulated population of double white dwarf binaries like those which may be observed by the future LISA mission. We simulate the formation of double white dwarf binaries by using the COSMIC population synthesis code to sample binary formation conditions such as initial mass function, metallicity of star formation, initial orbital period, and initial eccentricity. These binaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky-Way-like galaxy, and their signal-to-noise ratio for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a galactic gravitational wave foreground informed by the population. Through the use of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement error of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (&gt; 20 SNR, fGW &gt; 5mHz), in their gravitational wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process for different assumptions of the common envelope ejection efficiency, we apply Bayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected astrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model. We conclude that the impact of common envelope ejection efficiency on the mass transfer processes involved in double white dwarf formation may be statistically relevant in the future observed LISA population, and that constraints on binary formation may be found by comparing simulated populations to a future observed population.</description>

      <title>Black holes and covariance in effective quantum gravity: A solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a continuation of our previous work addressing general covariance in effective quantum gravity models within the Hamiltonian framework, this study presents explicit derivations of the previously proposed covariance equation. By solving this equation, a new Hamiltonian constraint is obtained, incorporating free functions that can account for quantum gravity effects. Specifying these functions allows for an analysis of the resulting spacetime structure. Remarkably, in this model, the classical singularity is replaced by a region where the metric asymptotically approaches a Schwarzschild-de Sitter one with negative mass. Unlike previously studied spacetime structures, this new quantum-corrected model avoids the presence of Cauchy horizons, potentially suggesting its stability under perturbations. Finally, the covariance of dust field coupling within the effective model is examined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Page curve exhibits a sharp peak at the Page time corresponding to a phase transition from an empty quantum extremal surface to a non-empty one. This study delves into the impact of this phase transition on the informational content of black hole radiation through constructing a smooth Page curve which represents a gradual transition instead. We utilize replica trick, apply holography in a specific form, and introduce mathematical identities inherent to the curve's smoothness. Our results suggest that a gradual transition could lead to a significant increase in the informational content of the radiation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from axion domain walls in level crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves (GWs) emission and the massive primordial black holes (PBHs) formation from the light QCD axion scenario. We consider the axion domain walls formation from the level crossing induced by the mass mixing between the light $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion and axion-like particle. A general mixing case is considered that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the level crossing. The domain walls must annihilate before dominating the Universe to avoid the cosmological catastrophe. Then we focus our attention on the GWs emission from the domain walls annihilation and the PBHs formation from the domain walls collapse. We show the predicted GWs spectra with the peak frequency $\sim 0.2\, \rm nHz$ and the peak amplitude $\sim 5\times 10^{-9}$, which can be tested by the future pulsar timing array projects. In addition, during the domain walls annihilation, the closed walls could shrink to the Schwarzschild radius and collapse into the PBHs. We find that the PBHs in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10^5-10^8) M_\odot$ could potentially form in this scenario and account for a small fraction $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the cold dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a novel test to assess deviations from well-established concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology while inferring dark energy properties. In contrast to the commonly implemented parametric forms of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS), we test the validity of the cosmological constant on the more fundamental scale factor [$a(t)$] which determines the expansion rate of the Universe. We constrain our extended `general model' using the late-time observables. The posterior of the dark energy EoS is mainly constrained to be quintessence-like naturally excluding physically unviable regions such as phantom crossings or exponential growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of an interior planar AdS (anti-de Sitter) black hole, requiring unitarity in the natural time coordinate conjugate to the cosmological "constant of motion" appearing in unimodular gravity. Both the classical singularity and the horizon are replaced by a non-singular highly quantum region; semiclassical notions of spacetime evolution are only valid in an intermediate region. For the singularity, our results should be applicable to general black holes: unitarity in unimodular time always implies singularity resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spinors on the total space of a Kaluza-Klein model with fuzzy sphere fibre and geometrically realised Dirac operator on the product. We show that a single massless spinor on the product appears on spacetime as multiplets of spinors with a particular signature of differing masses and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills charges. For example, for the reduced fuzzy sphere isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, a massless spinor appears as two $SU(2)$ doublets and an $SU(2)$ quadruplet in mass ratios $1:5/3:7/3$. Although such signatures do not appear to exactly match the Standard Model, the paper provides proof of concept of the approach, which can be applied to other noncommutative fibre algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will feature a prominent anisotropic astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave signal, arising from the tens of millions of unresolved mHz white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way: the Galactic foreground. While proper characterization of the Galactic foreground as a noise source will be crucial for every LISA science goal, it is extremely scientifically interesting in its own right, comprising -- along with $\sim10^4$ resolvable white dwarf binaries -- a complete sample of every mHz white dwarf binary in our Galaxy. We present a novel Bayesian analysis of the LISA Galactic foreground that directly treats its anisotropy via astrophysically-motivated templates, allowing for a direct connection between the observed time-modulation of the foreground amplitude and the underlying spatial distribution of the Milky Way. We validate the efficacy of this approach via simulated data and show that it is able to accurately recover the foreground spectrum in the presence of LISA instrumental noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A space-dependent mean for cosmological perturbations negates the ansatz of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, and hence ergodicity. In this work, we construct such a primordial mean of scalar perturbations from an alternative quantum initial state (coherent state) and examine the associated power and bi-spectra. A multitude of cosmological tests based on these spectra are discussed. We find that current cosmological data doesn't favor a primordial mean over large scales and strong constraints arise from the limit on bispectrum from Planck data. At small scales, this hypothesis can be tested by future observables such as $\mu$-distortion of CMB.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.    Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.    Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.     Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise  or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids on-board inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10\,$AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30\,$AU and $\sim 10\,$Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with $20\,$cm mirrors or $5\,$m radio dishes, although for the laser case this would require lower laser frequency noise relative to the LISA lasers. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>
