      <title>Using Matrix-Free Tensor-Network Optimizations to Construct a Reduced-Scaling and Robust Second-Order M{\o}ller-Plesset Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) to the tensor hypercontraction (THC) and Laplace transform (LT) approximated second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) method. By introducing these decompositions we formally reduce the scaling of the canonical MP2 method from $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ and the storage complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. We are able to construct the THC representation in $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ time by employing the interpolative separable density fitting decomposition strategy. Furthermore, we introduce a CPD optimization strategy that takes advantage of the THC representation to decompose the order-four two-electron integral tensor with a computational scaling of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. Finally, we show that the rank of the CPD in the approximation of MP2 scales linearly with system size and that this CPD-ISDF-LT MP2 strategy realizes a performance advantage over canonical LT MP2 in both computational wall-times and memory resource requirements.</description>

      <title>ByteQC: GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Package for Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17963v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/byteqc, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms.
  Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level.
  All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</description>

      <title>Picosecond imaging of dynamics of solvated electrons during femtosecond laser-induced plasma generation in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of solvated electrons were visualized using absorption imaging with sub-picosecond time resolution based on a pump-probe measurement during the early stages of femtosecond laser-induced plasma generation in water. The solvated electrons were generated by the propagation of a femtosecond laser pump pulse. In the area with a pump laser intensity over 2x10^13 W/cm2, where a high density of free electrons was produced, solvated electrons exhibited an additional rapid increase in optical density (OD) at 800 nm, 7-9 ps after the pump pulse excitation. In contrast, no two-step increase in OD was observed when probed at 400 nm, suggesting that the absorption coefficient of the solvated electrons rapidly changed around 800 nm after femtosecond laser excitation for a few picoseconds. This observation might indicate the structural and electronic modulation of solvated electrons owing to the high density of free electrons in water, accompanied by femtosecond-laser-induced plasma generation.</description>

      <title>Transformation-free generation of a quasi-diabatic representation from the state-average orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine how the recent quantum-computing algorithm known as the state-average orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE), viewed within the context of quantum chemistry as a type of multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) electronic-structure approach, exhibits a propensity to produce an ab initio quasi-diabatic representation ``for free'' if considered as a least-transformed block-diagonalization procedure, as alluded to in our previous work [S. Yalouz et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18 (2022) 776] and thoroughly assessed herein. To this end, we introduce intrinsic and residual descriptors of diabaticity and re-explore the definition and linear-algebra properties - as well as their consequences on the vibronic nonadiabatic couplings - of an optimal diabatic representation within this context, and how much one may deviate from it. Such considerations are illustrated numerically on the prototypical case of formaldimine, which presents a well-known conical intersection between its ground and first-excited singlet electronic states.</description>

      <title>Impact and Interplay of Quantum Coherence and Dissipative Dynamics for Isotope Effects in Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) is studied using a non-Markovian open quantum system perspective. Models of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and 10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline (HBQ) are adapted from Zhang et al. (ACS Phys. Chem. Au, 3, 107-118 (2023)) and simulated via the numerically exact TEDOPA Matrix Product State formalism, using a newly developed framework for continuous degrees of freedom subject to dissipation. The quantum treatment of the proton wave packet shows a counter-intuitive kinetic isotope effect, with strong isotope dependence for the barrierless potential surface of HBQ and no isotope effect in the double-well energy landscape of the HBT, in accordance with experimental results. Strikingly, for HBQ we find that changing laser pulse durations can even reverse the isotope effect on the proton transfer rate, revealing the role of vibration-assisted absorption in ESIPT. This study highlights the often neglected effect of excitation conditions on ESIPT, as well as the role of entangled, vibrationally assisted absorption processes that can be directly visualised in our multidimensional treatment of the full electro-vibronic-environment wave function.</description>

      <title>Quantifying hydrogen bonding using electrically tunable nanoconfined water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in biology and technology, yet it remains poorly understood and quantified despite its fundamental importance. Traditional models, which describe hydrogen bonds as electrostatic interactions between electropositive hydrogen and electronegative acceptors, fail to quantitatively capture bond strength, directionality, or cooperativity, and cannot predict the properties of complex hydrogen-bonded materials. Here, we introduce a novel approach that conceptualizes the effect of hydrogen bonds as elastic dipoles in an electric field, which captures a wide range of hydrogen bonding phenomena in various water systems. Using gypsum, a hydrogen bond heterostructure with two-dimensional structural crystalline water, we calibrate the hydrogen bond strength through an externally applied electric field. We show that our approach quantifies the strength of hydrogen bonds directly from spectroscopic measurements and reproduces a wide range of key properties of confined water reported in the literature. Using only the stretching vibration frequency of confined water, we can predict hydrogen bond strength, local electric field, O-H bond length, and dipole moment. Our work also introduces hydrogen bond heterostructures - a new class of electrically and chemically tunable materials that offer stronger, more directional bonding compared to van der Waals heterostructures, with potential applications in areas such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Qubit Coupled Cluster Ansatz on classical computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immense interest in quantum computing has prompted development of electronic structure methods that are suitable for quantum hardware. However, the slow pace at which quantum hardware progresses, forces researchers to implement their ideas on classical computers despite the obvious loss of any "quantum advantage." As a result, the so-called quantum inspired methods emerge. They allow one to look at the electronic structure problem from a different angle; yet, to fully exploit their capacity, efficient implementations are highly desirable. Here we report two schemes for improving the amplitude optimisation in the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method -- a variational quantum eigensolver-type approach which is based on the qubit coupled cluster (QCC) Ansatz. Our first scheme approximates the QCC unitary as a sum of symmetrical polynomials of generators up to a given order. The resulting energy expression allows for a flexible control of computational complexity via the order parameter. It also guaranties smoothness of trial energies and their derivatives, which is important for gradient-based optimization strategies. The second scheme limits the size of the expansion space in which the QCC unitary is generated. It provides better control of memory requirements, but in general may lead to the non-smooth variation of energy estimates upon changes in amplitudes. It can be used to extrapolate energies for a given set of amplitudes towards the exact QCC value. Both schemes allow for a larger number of generators to be included into the QCC form compared to the exact formulation. This reduces the number of iterations in the iQCC method and/or leads to higher accuracy. We assess capabilities of the new schemes to perform QCC amplitudes optimization for a few molecular systems: N$_2$ (16 qubits), H$_2$O (36 qubits), and tris(2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine) iridium(III), (80 qubits).</description>

      <title>Termination of bottom-up interstellar aromatic ring formation at C6H5+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aromatic molecule benzene is considered the essential building block for larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in space. Despite benzene's importance in the formation of PAHs, the formation mechanisms of interstellar benzene are not well understood. A single ion-molecule reaction sequence is considered when modeling the formation of benzene in the interstellar medium, beginning with the protonation of acetylene. Although this process has been used to model the initial steps for formation of PAHs, it has not been experimentally measured. To explore this reaction mechanism, we have carried out the first experimental study of sequential ion-molecule reactions beginning with protonation of acetylene at single-collision conditions. Surprisingly, we find that the reaction sequence does not result in benzene and instead terminates at C6H5+, which is unreactive toward both acetylene and hydrogen. This result disproves the previously proposed mechanism for interstellar benzene formation, critically altering our understanding of interstellar PAH formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb crystals, ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps, find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach of determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pre-trained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100-299 and secular temperatures of 5-15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</description>

      <title>Transferability of vibrational normalizing-flow coordinates: A pathway towards intrinsic coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing molecular vibrational energies and wavefunctions using variational approaches is a computationally demanding task, with the primary bottleneck being the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. The achievable accuracy depends on the dimensionality and complexity of the vibrational problem, the number and quality of the utilized basis functions and on the choice of vibrational coordinates. Composing basis sets with normalizing flows is a newly emerged idea to improve their expressivity and subsequently reduce the computational effort of variational methods. This approach generates coordinates tailored to a given vibrational problem for a selected truncated basis. We illustrate that the optimized coordinates results in more accurate predictions and faster convergence when transferred across different basis-set truncations, without the need for re-optimization. In addition, we show that the optimized coordinates are transferable across isotopologues and across molecules with similar structural motifs.</description>

      <title>Taming the Virtual Space for Incremental Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incremental full configuration interaction (iFCI) closely approximates the FCI limit with polynomial cost through a many-body expansion of the correlation energy, providing highly accurate total energies within a given basis set. To extend iFCI beyond previous basis set limitations, this work introduces a novel natural orbital screening approach, iNO-FCI. By consideration of the importance of virtual orbital selection in the convergence of iFCI, iNO-FCI maximizes the consistency between orbitals selected for each correlated body. iNO-FCI employs a principle of cancellation of errors and ensures that the same set of virtual NOs are used for interdependent terms. This strategy significantly reduces computational cost without compromises in precision. Computational savings of up to 95 percent are demonstrated, allowing access to larger basis sets that were previously computationally prohibitive. iNO-FCI is herein introduced and benchmarked for several difficult test cases involving double-bond dissociation, biradical systems, conjugated $\pi$ systems, and the spin gap of a Cu-based transition metal complex.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation by the tensor neural network. Based on the tensor product structure, we can do the direct numerical integration by using fixed quadrature points for the functions constructed by the tensor neural network within tolerable computational complexity. Especially, we design several types of efficient numerical methods to treat the variable-coupled Coulomb potentials with high accuracy. The corresponding machine learning method is built for solving many-body Schrodinger equation.

      <title>Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators</title>

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. The stability improvements cannot be matched by reducing the simulation timestep; thus, StABlE Training effectively allows for larger timesteps. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/ASK-Berkeley/StABlE-Training.</description>

      <title>The Rouse ring chain with attractive harmonic potential of spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the introduction of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature is studied. It is shown that a relatively weak potential can lead to a strong contraction of the polymer chain: the radius of gyration becomes much smaller compared to the size of free cyclic chain. The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e. the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a pseudo-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared segmental displacement.</description>
