      <title>Universal Basic Mass Density inside Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a universal basic mass density and a universal basic metric inside dark matter halos in the framework of Einstein equations providing an analytical ground for learning about dark matter. In a previous work the authors have proposed a simplified model for galaxies: a Schwarzschild black hole (that contains all the baryonic matter of the galaxy) immersed inside a dark matter halo. The solution solved the Einstein equations perturbatively and successfully gave the flat rotation curve and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, the two signatures of spiral galaxies. In this work we take the black hole mass (the baryonic mass) of the solution to be zero in order to focus our study on the dark matter halo exclusively. Among the results (1) is the prediction of a universal basic mass density of dark matter, $\rho=a_0/2\pi G r$, where $a_0\approx 2.8 \times 10^{-11} \ m/s^2$ is a universal constant whose value was deduced from observations, (2) we show that the mass and velocity curve of the dark halo agree excellently with observational data at intermediate distances where the baryonic matter contribution is negligible, (3) we show that the constant $a_0$ is the origin of the constant surface density of dark matter and the origin of the scale-radius/scale-density scaling relation of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile (4) we show how the inclusion of baryonic matter in our model solves the core-cusp problem.</description>

      <title>Multipoles of the galaxy bispectrum on a light cone: wide-separation and relativistic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy bispectrum provides access to correlations among different scales that cannot be captured by the power spectrum alone, and with the Stage-IV galaxy surveys it enables the possibility of detecting both primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) and general relativistic effects. Accounting for wide-separation corrections, which arise from the loss of symmetry in the correlation of widely separated points on the past light cone, is essential for their accurate modelling and detection. These corrections can be included perturbatively to the standard bispectrum and we compute them analytically for a generalised line of sight. We include the radial contribution to the wide-separations corrections for the first time. We show that the first-order corrections entering the odd multipoles with respect to the line of sight are large, up to $10 \%$ of the bispectrum monopole, and need to be included when considering the leading-order relativistic effects that could be detectable with surveys like DESI and Euclid. The second-order wide-separation and relativistic contributions, including their mixing terms, have implications for analysis of PNG and we show, for the local type, they can mimic $f_{\rm NL}$ of order 10 in the squeezed limit. We present full analytic expressions for all these contributions to the local bispectrum and its multipoles with a publicly available code for their computation.</description>

      <title>LVK constraints on PBHs from stochastic gravitational wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have left an imprint in the form of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) throughout their evolution in the history of the Universe. This review highlights two types of SGWB: those generated by scalar curvature perturbations associated with PBH formation in the early Universe and those composed of ensembles of GWs emitted by PBH binaries. After describing detection methods and a brief introduction on Bayesian inference, we discuss current constraints imposed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations through the non-detection of the SGWBs and discuss their physical implications.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian deflections in iterative optimal CMB lensing reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing signal from the Cosmic Microwave Background is highly valuable to constrain the growth of the structures in the Universe in a clean and robust manner over a wide range of redshifts. One of the theoretical systematics for lensing reconstruction is the impact of the lensing field non-Gaussianities on its estimators. Non-linear matter clustering and post-Born lensing corrections are known to bias standard quadratic estimators to some extent, most significantly so in temperature. In this work, we explore the impact of non-Gaussian deflections on Maximum a Posteriori lensing estimators, which, in contrast to quadratic estimators, are able to provide optimal measurements of the lensing field. We show that these naturally reduce the induced non- Gaussian bias and lead to unbiased cosmological constraints in $\Lambda$CDM at CMB-S4 noise levels without the need for explicit modelling. We also test the impact of assuming a non-Gaussian prior for the reconstruction; this mitigates the effect further slightly, but generally has little impact on the quality of the reconstruction. This shows that higher-order statistics of the lensing deflections are not expected to present a major challenge for optimal CMB lensing reconstruction in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Core-galaxy Connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halo core tracking is a novel concept designed to efficiently follow halo substructure in large simulations. We have recently developed this concept in gravity-only simulations to investigate the galaxy-halo connection in the context of empirical and semi-analytic models. Here, we incorporate information from hydrodynamics simulations, with an emphasis on establishing a connection between cores and galaxies. We compare cores across gravity-only, adiabatic hydrodynamics, and subgrid hydrodynamics simulations with the same initial phases. We demonstrate that cores are stable entities whose halo-centric radial profiles match across the simulations. We further develop a methodology that uses merging and infall mass cuts to group cores in the hydrodynamics simulation, creating on average, a one-to-one match to corresponding galaxies. We apply this methodology to cores from the gravity-only simulation, thus creating a proxy for galaxies which approximate the populations from the hydrodynamics simulation. Our results pave the way to incorporate inputs from smaller-scale hydrodynamics simulations directly into large-scale gravity-only runs in a principled manner.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the tensor/scalar ratio in single-field inflation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

      <title>Accurate Shear Recovery with Multi-Band Images of Hyper Suprime-Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing large scale weak lensing surveys typically reserve the best seeing conditions for a certain optical band to minimize shape measurement errors and maximize the number of usable background galaxies. This is because most popular shear measurement methods contain explicit or implicit thresholds on the galaxy-to-PSF (point spread function) size ratio, below which their shape measurement errors increase abruptly. Using the DECaLS data, we have previously demonstrated that the Fourier\_Quad method performs very well on poorly resolved galaxy images in general. It is therefore a ready tool for shear measurement with multi-band images regardless of their seeing conditions. In this paper, we apply the Fourier\_Quad pipeline on the multi-band images from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. We show that the shear catalogs from the five optical bands (g/r/i/z/y) all pass the field-distortion test with very high accuracy. Using the LOWZ and CMASS galaxies as foreground lenses, we show that the errorbar in the galaxy-galaxy lensing measurement can be decreased by factors around 15\% by combining shear catalogs from different bands. This indicates that it is worthful to do multi-bands shear measurements for a better shear statistics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Nonlinear Electrodynamics in the Universe: A Dynamical Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of cosmological models incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), focusing on their stability and causality. We explore two specific NLED models: the Power-Law and Rational Lagrangians. We assess these models' viability in describing the universe's evolution using dynamical systems theory and Bayesian inference. We present the theoretical framework of NLED coupled with general relativity, followed by an analysis of the stability and causality through the squared sound speed of the NLED Lagrangians. We then conduct a detailed dynamical analysis to identify the universe's evolution with this matter content. Our results show that the Power-Law Lagrangian model transitions through various cosmological phases from a Maxwell radiation-dominated state to a matter-dominated state. For the Rational Lagrangian model, including the Maxwell term, stable and causal behavior is observed within specific parameter ranges, with critical points indicating the evolutionary pathways of the universe. To validate our theoretical findings, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation using a comprehensive set of observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa). The estimated parameters for both models align with expected values for the current universe, particularly the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the Hubble parameter $h$. However, the parameters $\alpha$ and $b$ are not tightly constrained within the prior ranges. Our model comparison strongly favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the NLED models for late-universe observations, as the NLED model does not exhibit a cosmological constant behavior. Our results highlight the need for further refinement and exploration of NLED-based cosmological models to fully integrate them into the standard cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>K-mouflage at high k: extending the reach of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ code is an efficient dark matter simulation suite that flexibly handles the Horndeski family of modified gravity models. In this work we extend the scope of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to accommodate Horndeski theories with K-mouflage screening, allowing for the computation of matter power spectra in the non-linear regime in these models. We explore the boost of the dark matter power spectrum relative to GR-$\Lambda$CDM in K-mouflage gravity, and also discuss how large-scale structure computations change between the Einstein and Jordan frames. A dissection of the relative contributions of the modified background, linear growth, fifth force, and the conformal factor (a new inclusion to $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$) to the boost factor is presented. The ability of $\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to run with general Horndeski models and multiple screening mechanisms makes it an ideal tool for testing gravity with upcoming galaxy survey data.</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and a sign-switching cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

      <title>PineTree: A generative, fast, and differentiable halo model for wide-field galaxy surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mock halo catalogues are indispensable data products for developing and validating cosmological inference pipelines. A major challenge in generating mock catalogues is modelling the halo or galaxy bias, which is the mapping from matter density to dark matter halos or observable galaxies. To this end, N-body codes produce state-of-the-art catalogues. However, generating large numbers of these N-body simulations for big volumes, requires significant computational time. We introduce and benchmark a differentiable and physics-informed neural network that can generate mock halo catalogues of comparable quality to those obtained from full N-body codes. The model design is computationally efficient for the training procedure and the production of large mock suites. We present a neural network, relying only on 18 to 34 trainable parameters, that produces halo catalogues from dark matter overdensity fields. The reduction of network weights is realised through incorporating symmetries motivated by first principles into our model architecture. We train our model using dark matter only N-body simulations across different resolutions, redshifts, and mass bins. We validate the final mock catalogues by comparing them to N-body halo catalogues using different N-point correlation functions. Our model produces mock halo catalogues consistent with the reference simulations, showing that this novel network is a promising way to generate mock data for upcoming wide-field surveys due to its computational efficiency. Moreover, we find that the network can be trained on approximate overdensity fields to reduce the computational cost further. We also present how the trained network parameters can be interpreted to give insights into the physics of structure formation. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of our model as well as more general requirements and pitfalls for approximate halo mock generation.</description>

      <title>The power spectrum of luminosity distance fluctuations in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low redshift, it is possible to combine spectroscopic information of galaxies with their luminosity or angular diameter distance to directly measure the projection of peculiar velocities (PV) along the line-of-sight. A PV survey probing a large fraction of the sky is subject to so-called wide-angle effects, arising from the variation of the line-of-sight across the sky, and other sub-leading projection effects due to the propagation of the photons in a perturbed cosmological background. In this work, for the first time, we provide a complete description, within linear theory and General Relativity, of the power spectrum of luminosity distance fluctuations, clarifying its relation to the observables in a PV survey. We find that wide-angle effects will be detected at high significance by future observations and will have to be included in the cosmological analysis. Other relativistic projections effects could also be detected provided accurate, per object, distances are available.</description>

      <title>Straightening the Ruler: Field-Level Inference of the BAO Scale with LEFTfield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current inferences of the BAO scale from galaxy clustering employ a reconstruction technique at fixed cosmology and bias parameters. Here, we present the first consistent joint Bayesian inference of the isotropic BAO scale, jointly varying the initial conditions as well as all bias coefficients, based on the EFT-based field-level forward model $\texttt{LEFTfield}$. We apply this analysis to mock data generated with a much higher cutoff (resolution), resulting in a significant model mismatch between mock data and the model used in the inference. We demonstrate that the remaining systematic bias in the BAO scale is below 2% for all data considered and below 1% when Eulerian bias is used for inference. Furthermore, we find that the inferred error on the BAO scale is up to 1.6 times smaller compared to that from a replication of the standard power-spectrum reconstruction approach, using the same scales as in the field-level inference, with the improvement growing towards smaller scales (higher $k$). Thus, a field-level approach to BAO not only allows for a consistent inference of the BAO scale, but promises to achieve more precise measurements on the same data as well.</description>

      <title>The Superpotential Method and the Amplification of Inflationary Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superpotential method is a reconstruction technique which has proven useful to build exact cosmological solutions. We here employ the superpotential method in order to reconstruct the features necessary for the inflaton potential to drive inflation and lead to the amplification of the curvature perturbations. Such an amplification, at wavelengths shorter than those observed in the CMB, is necessary in order to have a significant formation of Primordial Black Holes after inflation ends. The technique is applied to the cases of a minimally coupled inflaton, to the non-minimal coupling case and to f(R) theories of gravity. For such theories, a model dependent analysis of the features leading to the scalar spectrum enhancement is also presented.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Thermal Structure &amp; The Origin of the Broad-Line Region, Torus, and Corona in Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations have demonstrated the formation of 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks, qualitatively distinct from both classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks, as a natural consequence of fueling gas to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. We previously showed that the dynamical structure of said disks can be approximated by simple analytic similarity models. Here we study the thermal properties of these models over a wide range of physical scales and accretion rates. We show there are several characteristic zones: a dusty 'torus'-like region, a multi-phase neutral and then multi-phase ionized, broad line-emitting region interior to the sublimation radius, before finally a transition to a thermal accretion disk with a warm Comptonizing layer. The disks are strongly-flared with large scale heights, and reprocess and/or scatter an order-one fraction of the central disk emission. As a result, this simple accretion disk model predicts phenomena including the existence of a dusty torus and its covering factor, geometry, clumpiness, and dust temperatures; a broad-line-region (BLR) with its characteristic sizes and luminosities and ionization properties; extended scattering/reprocessing surfaces producing cooler disk continuum and apparently large observed disk sizes; and existence of warm Comptonizing layers and hard coronal gas. Remarkably, these properties emerge without our having to introduce new components or parameters: they are all part of the accretion flow if the disks are in the hyper-magnetized limit.</description>

      <title>Zooming in on the Circumgalactic Medium with GIBLE: Tracing the Origin and Evolution of Cold Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the GIBLE suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies with additional super-Lagrangian refinement in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to quantify the origin and evolution of CGM cold gas clouds. The origin of $z$\,$=$\,$0$ clouds can be traced back to recent ($\lesssim$\,$2$\,Gyr) outflows from the central galaxy ($\sim$\,45\,$\%$), condensation out of the hot phase of the CGM in the same time frame ($\sim$\,45\,$\%$), and to a lesser degree to satellite galaxies ($\lesssim$\,5\,$\%$). We find that in-situ condensation results from rapid cooling around local over-densities primarily seeded by the dissolution of the previous generation of clouds into the hot halo. About $\lesssim$\,10\,$\%$ of the cloud population is long lived, with their progenitors having already assembled $\sim$\,$2$\,Gyr ago. Collective cloud-cloud dynamics are crucial to their evolution, with coalescence and fragmentation events occurring frequently ($\gtrsim$\,20\,Gyr$^{-1}$). These interactions are modulated by non-vanishing pressure imbalances between clouds and their interface layers. The gas content of clouds is in a constant state of flux, with clouds and their surroundings exchanging mass at a rate of \mbox{$\gtrsim$\,$10^3$\,M$_\odot$\,Myr$^{-1}$}, depending on cloud relative velocity and interface vorticity. Furthermore, we find that a net magnetic tension force acting against the density gradient is capable of inhibiting cloud-background mixing. Our results show that capturing the distinct origins of cool CGM clouds, together with their physical evolution, requires high-resolution, cosmological galaxy formation simulations with both stellar and supermassive black hole feedback-driven outflows.</description>

      <title>Even- and odd-parity stabilities of black holes in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether theories with a timelike unit vector field, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric black holes against both even- and odd-parity perturbations. For this purpose, we formulate a gauge-invariant black hole perturbation theory in the background Aether-orthogonal frame where the spacelike property of hypersurfaces orthogonal to the timelike Aether field is always maintained even inside the metric horizon. Using a short-wavelength approximation with large radial and angular momenta, we show that, in general, there are three dynamical degrees of freedom arising from the even-parity sector besides two propagating degrees of freedom present in the odd-parity sector. The propagation speeds of even-parity perturbations and their no-ghost conditions coincide with those of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations on the Minkowski background, while the odd sector contains tensor and vector modes with the same propagation speeds as those in the even-parity sector (and hence as those on the Minkowski background). Thus, the consistent study of black hole perturbations in the Aether-orthogonal frame on static and spherically symmetric backgrounds does not add new small-scale stability conditions to those known for the Minkowski background in the literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Multi-Band Observations of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we highlight an important perspective for the complete understanding of the stochastic gravitational background structure. The stochastic gravitational wave background is perhaps the most important current and future tool towards pinpointing the early Universe phenomenology related with the inflationary era and the subsequent reheating era. Many mysteries are inherent to the stochastic spectrum so in this work we highlight the fact that the complete understanding of early Universe physics and of astrophysical processes requires data from many distinct frequency band ranges. The combination of these data will provide a deeper and better understanding of the physics that forms the stochastic gravitational wave background, in both cases that it is of cosmological or astrophysical origin. We also discuss how the reheating temperature may be determined by combining multi-band frequency data from gravitational wave experiments and we also discuss how the shape of the gravitational wave energy spectrum can help us better understand the physical processes that formed it.</description>

      <title>Inferring intrahalo light from stellar kinematics -- A deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangling the stellar population in the central galaxy from the intrahalo light can help us shed light on the formation history of the host halo, as the properties of the stellar components are expected to retain traces of its formation history. Many approaches are adopted, depending on different physical assumptions (e.g. the light profile, chemical composition, and kinematical differences) and on whether the full six-dimensional phase-space information is known (much like in simulations) or whether one analyses projected quantities (i.e. observations). This paper paves the way for a new approach to bridge the gap between observational and simulation methods. We propose the use of projected kinematical information from stars in simulations in combination with deep learning to create a robust method for identifying intrahalo light in observational data to enhance understanding and consistency in studying the process of galaxy formation. Using a U-Net, we developed a methodology for predicting these contributions from a sample of mock images from hydrodynamical simulations to train, validate and test the network. Reinforced training (Attention U-Net) was used to improve the first results, as the innermost central regions of the mock images consistently overestimate the stellar intrahalo contribution. Our work shows that adequate training over a representative sample of mock images can lead to good predictions of the intrahalo light distribution. The model is mildly dependent on the training size and its predictions are less accurate when applied to mock images from different simulations. However, the main features (spatial scales and gradients of the stellar fractions) are recovered for all tests. While the method presented here should be considered as a proof of concept, future work is required to enable the application of the proposed model to observational data.</description>

      <title>Dark matter-electron scattering and freeze-in scenarios in the light of $Z^\prime$ mediation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM)-electron scattering in a minimal $U(1)_X$ extension of the Standard Model (SM), where the DM can appear as a Majorana fermion, a complex singlet scalar or a Dirac fermion. To study bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and new gauge boson mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$, from DM-electron scattering, we consider several direct search experiments like CDMS, DAMIC, SENSEI, PandaX-II, DarkSide-50 and XENON1T-S2 for different $U(1)_X$ charges. In this set-up we consider DM production via freeze-in both in radiation dominated and modified cosmological background to project sensitivities on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane satisfying observed relic abundance. DM-electron scattering could provide comparable, or even stronger bounds than those obtained from the electron/ muon $(g-2)$, low energy scattering and intensity frontier experiments within 0.01 GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim$ 0.1 GeV. Constrains from freeze-in could provide stronger sensitivities for $M_{Z^\prime}\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV, however, these limits are comparable to those obtained from LHCb, LEP experiments for $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 150$ GeV. In future, electron-muon scattering (MUonE), proton (FASER, DUNE) and electron/positron (ILC) beam dump experiments could probe these parameters.</description>

Abstract: We propose a two-field inflationary model with the induced gravity term. Using conformal transformation of the metric, we get the chiral cosmological model with two scalar fields. We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary model do not contradict to observation data and is suitable for primordial black hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider PBHs as dark matter candidates.</description>

Abstract: The measurement of colours in photometric surveys is a path to get access to cosmological distances. But for future large surveys like the Large Survey of Space and Time undertaken by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, the large statistical power of the promised catalogues will make the photometric calibration uncertainties dominant in the error budget and will limit our ability to use it for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the in situ atmospheric transmission for each exposure, each season and on average for the entire survey can help reaching the subpercent precision for magnitudes. I will show the impact of precipitable water vapour during a cosmological survey on supernova cosmology. Then I will present how AuxTel at the Vera Rubin Observatory have the capability to measure the on-site atmospheric transmission in real time to improve LSST photometric calibration for precision cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $S_8/\sigma_8$ tension in the large scale structure can be explained by decaying dark matter with an almost degenerate spectrum and small enough decay width. Here we propose the Gemini dark matter model, which contains a heavy mother particle $\chi_3$ and two twins $\chi_{1/2}$ which are almost degenerate in mass and are produced at the same time. The dark sector is charged under the same Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry that can explain the hierarchy of the Standard model Yukawa couplings. The slightly heavier $\chi_2$ decays into $\chi_1$ and the axionic component of the flavon, which washes out the small scale structure and resolves $S_8/\sigma_8$ tension. We present the production mechanism of Gemini dark matter and viable parameter regions. We find that despite the preferred dark matter mass being $\mathcal{O}(1)$--$\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV, they constitute cold dark matter. The Gemini dark matter model predicts an abundance of dark radiation that will be probed in future measurements of the CMB.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale cosmic filaments connect galaxies, clusters and voids. They are permeated by magnetic fields with a variety of topologies. Cosmic rays with energies up to $10^{20}\;\!{\rm eV}$ can be produced in astrophysical environments associated with star-formation and AGN activities. The fate of these cosmic rays in filaments, which cannot be directly observed on Earth, are rarely studied. We investigate the high-energy processes associated with energetic particles (cosmic rays) in filaments, adopting an ecological approach that includes galaxies, clusters/superclusters and voids as key cosmological structures in the filament ecosystem. We derive the phenomenology for modelling interfaces between filaments and these structures, and investigate how the transfer and fate of energetic cosmic ray protons are affected by the magnetism of the interfaces. We consider different magnetic field configurations in filaments and assess the implications for cosmic ray confinement and survival against hadronic pion-producing and photo-pair interactions. Our analysis shows that the fate of the particles depends on the location of their origin within a filament ecosystem, and that filaments act as `highways', channelling cosmic rays between galaxies, galaxy clusters and superclusters. Filaments can also operate as cosmic `fly paper', capturing cosmic ray protons with energies up to $10^{18}\;\!{\rm eV}$ from cosmic voids. Our analysis predicts the presence of a population of $\sim 10^{12}-10^{16}\;\!{\rm eV}$ cosmic ray protons in filaments and voids accumulated continually over cosmic time. These protons do not suffer significant energy losses through photo-pair or pion-production, nor can they be cooled efficiently. Instead, they form a cosmic ray fossil record of the power generation history of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>

Abstract: On-going or soon to come cosmological large-scale structure surveys such as DESI, SPHEREx, Euclid, or the High-Latitude Spectroscopic Survey of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope promise unprecedented measurement of the clustering of galaxies on large scales. When quantified with the Cartesian Fourier basis, the measurement of these large scales requires the introduction of so-called wide-angle corrections. By contrast, the measurement of the power spectrum in a spherical Fourier Bessel (SFB) basis does not require such corrections and naturally accounts for the spherical survey geometries. Here, we develop and implement a fast code to construct the SFB power spectrum and investigate how line of sight effects, physics such as non-Gaussianity, and differing survey geometries affect SFB power spectrum estimates. We then leverage our program to predict the tightness of cosmological constraints from realistic survey specifications using a Fisher matrix formalism.</description>

      <title>Statistical Bias in the Hubble Constant and Mass Power Law Slope for Mock Strong Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing offers constraints on the Hubble constant that are independent of other methods. However, those constraints are subject to uncertainties in lens models. Previous studies suggest that using an elliptical power law + external shear (EPL+XS) for the lensing galaxy can yield results that are precise but inaccurate. We examine such models by generating and fitting mock lenses which produces multiple images of a background quasar-like point source. Despite using the same model for input and output, we find statistical bias in the Hubble constant on the order of 3% to 5%, depending on whether the elliptical lenses have noise or not. The phase space distribution has a `flared' shape that causes the mass power law slope to be underestimated and the Hubble constant to be overestimated. The bias varies with image configuration, which we quantify through annulus length between images with the first and second time delays ($\Delta r_{1,2}$). The statistical bias is worse for configurations that have narrow annuli (e.g., symmetric cross configurations). Assuming a source at redshift 2.0 and an EPL+XS lens at redshift 0.3, we find that the bias can be reduced, but not eliminated, if we limit the sample to systems with annulus lengths $\Delta r_{1,2} \gtrsim 0.3$ arcsec. As lens samples grow, it may be helpful to prioritize this range of image configurations for follow-up observation and analysis.</description>

      <title>Effects of feedback-free starburst galaxies on the 21-cm signal and reionization history</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different star-formation models at Cosmic Dawn produce detectable signatures in the observables of upcoming 21-cm experiments. In this work, we consider the physical scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), according to which the star-formation efficiency (SFE) is enhanced in sufficiently massive halos at early enough times, thus explaining the indication from the James Webb Space Telescope for an excess of bright galaxies at $z \geq 10$. We model the contribution of FFBs to popII SFE and compute the impact these have on the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum. We show that FFBs affect the evolution of the brightness temperature and the 21-cm power spectrum, but they only have a limited effect on the neutral hydrogen fraction. We investigate how the observables are affected by changes in the underlying star formation model and by contribution from popIII stars. Finally, we forecast the capability of next-generation Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) to detect the existence of FFB galaxies via power spectrum measurements. Our results show the possibility of a significant detection, provided that popII stars are the main drivers of lowering the spin temperature. Efficient popIII star formation will make the detection more challenging.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Binary Stars Mediated by Ultralight Scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the electromagnetic (EM) dipole radiation flux from an eccentric Keplerian binary endowed with scalar charges, in the presence of scalar-photon coupling $\phi A_\mu A^\mu$ or $\phi F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The scalar radiation is suppressed for orbital frequency below the scalar mass, while the scalar-mediated indirect EM radiation survives. We examine the constraints imposed on the scalar-photon and scalar-charge couplings by the current observational data, in case that the scalar charge is given by the muon number. The extensions of our calculation to the quadrupole order and hyperbolic orbit are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Photometric wide-area observations in the next decade will be capable of detecting a large number of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, increasing the gravitational lens sample size by orders of magnitude. To aid in forecasting and analysis of these surveys, we construct a flexible model based on observed distributions for the lens and source properties and test it on the results of past lens searches, including SL2S, SuGOHI and searches on the COSMOS HST and DES fields. We use this model to estimate the expected yields of some current and planned surveys, including Euclid Wide, Vera Rubin LSST, and Roman High Latitude Wide Area. The model proposed includes a set of free parameters to constrain on the identifiability of a lens in an image, allowing construction of prior probability distributions for different lens detection methods. The code used in this work is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Large-scale geometry and topology of gas fields: Effects of AGN and stellar feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) primarily affects the formation and evolution of galaxies and the circumgalactic medium, leaving some kind of imprint on larger scales. Based on the {\sc Simba} hydrodynamical simulation suite and using the full set of Minkowski functionals (MFs), this study systematically analyses the time evolution of the global geometry and topology of the gas temperature, pressure, density (total, HI, and H$_2$), and the metallicity fields between redshifts $z=5$ and $z=0$. The MFs show that small-scale astrophysical processes are persistent and manifest on larger, up to tens of Mpc scales, highlighting the specific morphological signatures of the relevant feedback mechanisms on these scales in the last $\sim12$~Gyr. In qualitative terms, we were able establish a ranking that varies according to the field considered: stellar feedback mostly determines the morphology of the pressure and density fields and AGN jets are the primary origin of the morphology of the temperature and metallicity fields, while X-ray heating and AGN winds play the second most important role in shaping the geometry and topology of all the gaseous fields, except metallicity. Hence, the cosmic evolution of the geometry and topology of fields characterising the thermodynamical and chemical properties of the cosmic web offers complementary, larger scale constraints to galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.</description>

      <title>Fate of homogeneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter, if represented by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field, can manifest as both particles and condensates. In this paper, we study the evolution of an oscillating homogeneous condensate of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field in a thermal plasma in an FLRW universe. We focus on the perturbative regime where the oscillation amplitude is sufficiently small so that parametric resonance is inefficient. This perturbative regime necessarily comprises the late stage of the condensate decay and determines its fate. The coupled coarse-grained equations of motion for the condensate, radiation, and spacetime are derived from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. We obtain analytical expressions for the relevant microscopic quantities that enter the equations of motion and solve the latter numerically. We find that there is always a nonvanishing relic abundance for a condensate with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is not spontaneously broken. This is because its decay rate decreases faster than the Hubble parameter at late times due to either the amplitude dependence or the temperature dependence in the condensate decay rate. Consequently, accounting for the condensate contribution to the overall dark matter relic density is essential for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ scalar singlet dark matter.</description>

      <title>Towards Systematic Evaluation of de Sitter Correlators via Generalized Integration-By-Parts Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

      <title>A measurement of the sodium and iodine scintillation quenching factors across multiple NaI(Tl) detectors to identify systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amount of light produced by nuclear recoils in scintillating targets is strongly quenched compared to that produced by electrons. A precise understanding of the quenching factor is particularly interesting for WIMP searches and CE{\nu}NS measurements since both rely on nuclear recoils, whereas energy calibrations are more readily accessible from electron recoils. There is a wide variation among the current measurements of the quenching factor in sodium iodide (NaI) crystals, especially below 10 keV, the energy region of interest for dark matter and CE{\nu}NS studies. A better understanding of the quenching factor in NaI(Tl) is of particular interest for resolving the decades-old puzzle in the field of dark matter between the null results of most WIMP searches and the claim for dark matter detection by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. In this work, we measured sodium and iodine quenching factors for five small NaI(Tl) crystals grown with similar thallium concentrations and growth procedures. Unlike previous experiments, multiple crystals were tested, with measurements made in the same experimental setup to control systematic effects. The quenching factors agree in all crystals we investigated, and both sodium and iodine quenching factors are smaller than those reported by DAMA/LIBRA. The dominant systematic effect was due to the electron equivalent energy calibration originating from the non-proportional behavior of the NaI(Tl) light yield at lower energies, potentially the cause for the discrepancies among the previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Impact of Star Pressure on $\gamma$ in Modified Gravity beyond Post-Newtonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the PPN approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit non\text{-}perturbative$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set $\textit joint$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 $\textit irrespective$ of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Modelling the star-formation activity and ionizing properties of high-redshift galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early results from the JWST observations have reported a surprisingly high number of UV-bright galaxies at $z \geq 10$, which appears to challenge the theoretical predictions from standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM framework at these redshifts. To alleviate this tension, several cosmological and astrophysical interpretations have been advanced. However, all of these proposed scenarios carry noteworthy consequences for other large-scale processes in the early Universe, particularly cosmic reionization, since high-redshift galaxies are believed to be the primary ionizing sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To investigate this, we introduce a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution that explains the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (UVLF) over $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$, and also jointly tracks the time evolution of the globally averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium. The model self-consistently accounts for the suppression of star formation in low-mass galaxies due to reionization feedback and is constrained by comparing the model predictions with various observational probes like the UVLF data from HST and JWST, recent measurements of the neutral hydrogen fraction, and the CMB scattering optical depth. Our analysis confirms that a rapid enhancement in the star-formation rate efficiency and/or UV luminosity per stellar mass formed is necessary for consistency with the JWST UVLF estimates at $z \geq 10$. We further find that it is possible to jointly satisfy the current reionization constraints when the escape fraction is assumed to be halo-mass dependent, requiring higher Lyman-continuum leakage from low-mass galaxies. We also examine the relative contribution of galaxies with different UV luminosities towards the ionizing photon budget for the EoR and investigate the large-scale bias of high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spin-independent interactions of Dirac Fermionic Dark Matter in the composite Higgs models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>
