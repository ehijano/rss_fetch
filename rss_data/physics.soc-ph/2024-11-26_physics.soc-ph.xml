      <title>Impact of consumer preferences on decarbonization of transport sector in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonization of transport sector through adoption of cleaner vehicle options will depend on the environmental awareness of consumers and their priorities. This work develops and uses a system dynamics approach to understand possible adoption pathways of novel vehicle options, i.e., ethanol-blended fuel (E85), electric, and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles in India. A system dynamics model using a multi-nominal logit model to capture consumer choices has been previously developed for the private road transport sector of India. The model has been modified to also include annual vehicular emissions as a decisionmaking attribute in addition to the annual cost. Four different classes of consumers with different priorities to cost and annual emissions are modeled. The model coefficients are identified using historical data. Model simulations over a period of 30 years till 2050 are performed to determine possible vehicle adoption trends. Different scenarios of changing environmental awareness, policy interventions, and technology development were analyzed to achieve targets such as COP26 greenhouse gas emission reduction, ethanol blending, and EV adoption. Simulation results showed that an increase in environmental awareness resulted in the adoption of novel vehicle options by 67.42% and 22.3% of the car and two-wheeler stocks, respectively. However, rising environmental awareness was not enough to meet the target values. Scenario analysis showed that a greater share of renewables in the electricity grid, carbon tax on transport fuel, and reduced vehicle driving together can possibly achieve the GHG emissions target in 2030. Battery-related GHG emissions were shown to be very important and led to counter-intuitive trends in EV adoption. 30% EV sales by 2030 could be achieved with a greener electricity grid and carbon tax.</description>

      <title>Path to Low-Cost Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now accepted that gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) from the atmosphere are needed to avoid the threat of catastrophic climate change. Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a promising scalable CDR with a relatively small environmental footprint. But questions about DAC cost and energy use remain that are delaying the needed DAC policy decisions to create a mobilization effort like was done in the Manhattan Project and to address the Covid crisis. Global Thermostat (GT) has publicly claimed costs of under 50 dollars per tonne for mature GT technology deployed at a climate relevant scale. Why this low DAC cost is achievable will be addressed by a simplified analysis of generic DAC costs and using that analysis combined with experimental data to evaluate GT's DAC technology. A detailed cost analysis of different approaches to DAC by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found an approach to DAC that had a learning cost limit as low as 25 dollars per tonne GT's DAC technology will be shown in Appendix 1 to have the same performance characteristics of the lowest-cost DAC identified in the NAS study. Thus, like solar costs, DAC costs can be reduced by learning by doing, but in the case of DAC, only one order of magnitude in cost reduction is needed. Therefore DAC technology can reach its low learning by doing cost limit at a scale much smaller than necessary to address climate change. From a climate perspective, current DAC embodiments costs and scale have less relevance than their learning curve cost limit. While GT's technology has demonstrated the crucial performance parameters to achieve a low-cost DAC, no inference should be drawn that other approaches cannot achieve low or lower cost, if they can demonstrate the crucial performance parameters. Continued R&amp;D on those performance parameters is needed.</description>

      <title>Integrating optimal ridesharing matching into multimodal traffic model: Implications for policy and sustainable transport system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating ridesharing matching explicitly into multimodal traffic models is crucial for accurately assessing the impacts of multimodal transport (MT) on urban economic and environmental aspects. This paper integrates an optimal ridesharing matching method into a path-based deterministic day-to-day traffic assignment framework, considers match cancellations, and captures the interactions between various modes on the road. The model incorporates five traffic modes (solo driving, ridesharing as a driver, ridesharing as a passenger, bus travel, and metro travel) and two groups of travelers based on their ownership status. Its steady state is determined through numerical experiments. The sensitivity analyses reveal that the MT system's performance varies with changes in ownership, bus fare, and ridesharing fare, demonstrating diverse impacts on mode split, travel cost, and emissions across different groups, road links, and regions. Our findings suggest that vehicle restrictions and pricing strategies have both benefits and drawbacks in managing MT system, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of trade-offs and social equity implications in policy-making and implementation. This study not only enhances the theoretical understanding of MT system but also provides valuable support for urban transportation policy-making aimed at achieving efficient, sustainable, and socially equitable transport systems.</description>

      <title>Winning opinion: Following Your Friends' Advice or That of Their Friends?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a variation of the classical voter model in which the set of influencing agents depends on an individual's current opinion. The initial population consists of a random sample of equally sized subpopulations for each state, and two types of interactions are considered: (i) direct neighbors, and (ii) second neighbors (friends of direct neighbors, excluding the direct neighbors themselves). The neighborhood size, reflecting regular network connectivity, is kept constant across all agents.
  Our findings reveal that varying the interaction range introduces asymmetries that influence the probability of consensus and convergence time. At low connectivity, direct neighbor interactions dominate, driving consensus. As connectivity increases, the probability of consensus for either state becomes equal, mirroring symmetric dynamics. Asymmetry is also reflected in convergence time: while symmetric cases show decreasing times with increased connectivity, asymmetric cases exhibit an almost linear increase. The introduction of stubborn agents further accentuates these effects, particularly when they favor the less dominant state, significantly increasing consensus time.
  We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for decision-making processes and political campaigns in human populations.</description>

      <title>Contrasting and comparing the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions on air-borne and vector-borne diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at limiting human mobility have demonstrated success in curbing the transmission of airborne diseases. However, their effectiveness in managing vector-borne diseases remains less clear. In this study, we introduce a framework that integrates mobility data with vulnerability matrices to evaluate the differential impacts of mobility-based NPIs on both airborne and vector-borne pathogens. Focusing on the city of Santiago de Cali in Colombia, our analysis illustrates how mobility-based policies previously proposed to contain airborne disease can make cities more prone to the spread of vector-borne diseases. By proposing a simplified synthetic model, we explain the limitations of the latter policies and exploit the synergies between both types of diseases to find new interventions reshaping the mobility network for their simultaneous control. Our results thus offer valuable insights into the epidemiological trade-offs of concurrent disease management, providing a foundation for the design and assessment of targeted interventions that reshape human mobility.</description>

      <title>Homeopathic Modernization and the Middle Science Trap: conceptual context of ergonomics, econometrics and logic of some national scientific case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article analyses the structural and institutional barriers hindering the development of scientific systems in transition economies, such as Kazakhstan. The main focus is on the concept of the "middle science trap," which is characterized by steady growth in quantitative indicators (publications, grants) but a lack of qualitative advancement. Excessive bureaucracy, weak integration into the international scientific community, and ineffective science management are key factors limiting development. This paper proposes an approach of "homeopathic modernization," which focuses on minimal yet strategically significant changes aimed at reducing bureaucratic barriers and enhancing the effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem. A comparative analysis of international experience (China, India, and the European Union) is provided, demonstrating how targeted reforms in the scientific sector can lead to significant results. Social and cultural aspects, including the influence of mentality and institutional structure, are also examined, and practical recommendations for reforming the scientific system in Kazakhstan and Central Asia are offered. The conclusions of the article could be useful for developing national science modernization programs, particularly in countries with high levels of bureaucracy and conservatism.</description>

      <title>Generating social networks with static and dynamic utility-maximization approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a conceptual framework that model human social networks as an undirected dot-product graph of independent individuals. Their relationships are only determined by a cost-benefit analysis, i.e. by maximizing an objective function at the scale of the individual or of the whole network. On this framework, we build a new artificial network generator in two versions. The first fits within the tradition of artificial network generators by being able to generate similar networks from empirical data. The second relaxes the computational efficiency constraint and implements the same micro-based decision algorithm, but in agent-based simulations with time and fully independent agents. This latter version enables social scientists to perform an in-depth analysis of the consequences of behavioral constraints affecting individuals on the network they form. This point is illustrated by a case study of imperfect information.</description>

      <title>Detecting the sensitive spots of the African interurban transport network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport systems are vulnerable to disruption. This is particularly true in Africa, where there are large areas with few highways and heightened risk of violence. Here we attempt to estimate the costs of violent events on African transport in order to understand the way that it may be limiting integration between regions. In the absence of detailed data on trade or migration, we quantify the cost of violence by relating observed incidents to imputed spatial interaction between cities. We produce indices representing the expected intensity of violent events $\mu$ and the expected strength of interaction $\nu$ between cities in the African interurban network. We estimate the intensity of conflict in a city and, considering the network of all highways on the continent, use a gravity model to generate flows between pairs of cities. We systematically compare $\mu$ to $\nu$ and classify areas according to their combined impact and intensity. Results show that certain cities and roads in the network contain outsize risk to Africa's transportation infrastructure. These cities have a high propensity for subsequent violence against civilians, and given their role in the network, they also substantially affect regional connectivity and thus economic integration. According to our model, removing just ten edges due to conflict would require rerouting 32$\%$ of trips. The top 100 edges where violence is likely to happen account for 17$\%$ of all trips. We find that cities with the highest $\mu-\nu$ risk are typically small and medium size with large degree, meaning they act as hubs. Vulnerable areas tend to be characterised by the presence of terrorist groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria or Al Shabaab in Somalia.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Reactor Safeguarding with Neutrino Detection for MOX Loading Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resurgence of interest in nuclear power around the world highlights the importance of effective methods to safeguard against nuclear proliferation. Many powerful safeguarding techniques have been developed and are currently employed, but new approaches are needed to address proliferation challenges from emerging advanced reactor designs and fuel cycles. Building on prior work that demonstrated monitoring of nuclear reactor operation using neutrino detectors, we develop and present a simple quantitative statistical test suitable for analysis of measured reactor neutrino data and demonstrate its efficacy in a semi-cooperative reactor monitoring scenario. In this approach, a moderate-sized neutrino detector is placed near the reactor site to help monitor possible MOX fuel diversion independent of inspection-based monitoring. We take advantage of differing time-dependent neutrino count rates during the operating cycle of a reactor core to monitor any deviations of measurements from expectations given a declared fuel composition. For a five-ton idealized detector placed 25m away from a hypothetical 3565 MWth reactor, the statistical test is capable of detecting the diversion of ~80kg plutonium at the 95% confidence level 90% of the time over a 540-day observation period.</description>

      <title>Learning thresholds lead to stable language coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a language competition model that is based on the Abrams-Strogatz model and incorporates the effects of memory and learning in the language shift dynamics. On a coarse grained time scale, the effects of memory and learning can be expressed as thresholds on the speakers fractions of the competing languages. In its simplest form, the resulting model is exactly solvable. Besides the consensus on one of the two languages, the model describes additional equilibrium states that are not present in the Abrams-Strogatz model: a stable dynamical coexistence of the two languages and a frozen state coinciding with the initial state. We show numerically that these results are preserved for threshold functions of a more general shape. The comparison of the model predictions with historical datasets demonstrates that while the Abrams-Strogatz model fails to describe some relevant language competition situations, the proposed model provides a good fitting.</description>

      <title>The effects of fair allocation principles on energy system model designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What constitutes socially just or unjust energy systems or transitions can be derived from the philosophy and theories of justice. Assessments of justice and utilising them in modelling lead to great differences based on which justice principles are applied. We find that comparisons between the two principles of utilitarianism and egalitarianism dominate in assessments of distributive justice, with the latter most often considered representing a "just energy system". The lack of recognition of alternative and equally valid principles of justice, resting on e.g. capabilities, responsibilities and/or opportunities, leads to a narrow understanding of justice that fails to align with the views of different individuals, stakeholders and societies. More importantly, it can lead to the unjust design of future energy systems and energy systems analysis. In this work, we contribute to the growing amount of research on justice in energy systems modelling by assessing the implications of different philosophical views on justice on modelling results. Through a modelling exercise with a power system model for Europe, we explore different designs of a future net-zero European energy system, and its distributional implications based on the application of different justice principles. In addition to the utilitarian and egalitarian approach, we include, among others, principles of "polluters pay" and "ability-to-pay", which take historical contributions of GHG and the socio-economic conditions of a region into account. We find that socially just energy systems look significantly different depending on the justice principles applied. The results may stimulate a greater discussion among researchers and policymakers on the implications of different constructions of justice in modelling, expansion of approaches, and demonstrate the importance of transparency and assumptions when communicating such results</description>

      <title>Deciphering Urban Morphogenesis: A Morphospace Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cities emerged independently across different world regions and historical periods, raising fundamental questions: How did the first urban settlements develop? What social and spatial conditions enabled their emergence? Are these processes universal or context-dependent? Moreover, what distinguishes cities from other human settlements? This paper investigates the drivers behind the creation of cities through a hybrid approach that integrates urban theory, the biological concept of morphospace (the space of all possible configurations), and archaeological evidence. It explores the transition from sedentary hunter-gatherer communities to urban societies, highlighting fundamental forces converging to produce increasingly complex divisions of labour as a central driver of urbanization. Morphogenesis is conceptualized as a trajectory through morphospace, governed by structure-seeking selection processes that balance density, permeability, and information as critical dimensions. The study highlights the non-ergodic nature of urban morphogenesis, where configurations are progressively selected based on their fitness to support the diversifying interactions between mutually dependent agents. The morphospace framework effectively distinguishes between theoretical spatial configurations, non-urban and proto-urban settlements, and contemporary cities. This analysis supports the proposition that cities emerge and evolve as solutions balancing density, permeability, and informational organization, enabling them to support increasingly complex societal functions.</description>
