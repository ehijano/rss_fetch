      <title>On the Weight Spectrum of Rate-Compatible Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weight spectrum plays a crucial role in the performance of error-correcting codes. Despite substantial theoretical exploration into polar codes with mother code length, a framework for the weight spectrum of rate-compatible polar codes remains elusive. In this paper, we address this gap by enumerating the number of minimum-weight codewords for quasi-uniform punctured, Wang-Liu shortened, and bit-reversal shortened polar codes. Additionally, we propose efficient algorithms for computing the average spectrum of random upper-triangular pre-transformed shortened and punctured polar codes. Notably, our algorithms operate with polynomial complexity relative to the code length. Simulation results affirm that our findings can substantially enhance the practical construction of rate-compatible polar codes, and leading to an improved weight spectrum.</description>

      <title>Stopping Set Analysis for Concatenated Polar Code Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates properties of concatenated polar codes and their potential applications. We start with reviewing previous work on stopping set analysis for conventional polar codes, which we extend in this paper to concatenated architectures. Specifically, we present a stopping set analysis for the factor graph of concatenated polar codes, deriving an upper bound on the size of the minimum stopping set. To achieve this bound, we propose new bounds on the size of the minimum stopping set for conventional polar code factor graphs. The tightness of these proposed bounds is investigated empirically and analytically. We show that, in some special cases, the exact value of the minimum stopping set can be determined with a time complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the codeword length. The stopping set analysis motivates a novel construction method for concatenated polar codes. This method is used to design outer polar codes for two previously proposed concatenated polar code architectures: augmented polar codes and local-global polar codes. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed codes over previously proposed constructions based on density evolution (DE).</description>

      <title>Joint User Scheduling and Precoding for RIS-Aided MU-MISO Systems: A MADRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted massive attention due to its low-cost and capability of controlling wireless environment. However, there is still a lack of treatments to deal with the growth of the number of users and RIS elements, which may incur performance degradation or computational complexity explosion. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization of user scheduling and precoding for distributed RIS-aided communication systems. Firstly, we propose an optimization-based numerical method to obtain suboptimal solutions with the aid of the approximation of ergodic sum rate. Secondly, to reduce the computational complexity caused by the high dimensionality, we propose a data-driven scalable and generalizable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with the aim to maximize the ergodic sum rate approximation through the cooperation of all agents. Further, we propose a novel dynamic working process exploiting the trained MADRL algorithm, which enables distributed RISs to configure their own passive precoding independently. Simulation results show that our algorithm substantially reduces the computational complexity by a time reduction of three orders of magnitude at the cost of 3% performance degradation, compared with the optimization-based method, and achieves 6% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art MADRL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Available Degrees of Spatial Multiplexing of a Uniform Linear Array with Multiple Polarizations: a Holographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly enhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</description>

      <title>Age of Coded Updates In Gossip Networks Under Memory and Memoryless Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an information update system on a gossip network, where a source node encodes information into $n$ total keys such that any subset of at least $k+1$ keys can fully reconstruct the original information. This encoding process follows the principles of a $k$-out-of-$n$ threshold system. The encoded updates are then disseminated across the network through peer-to-peer communication. We have two different types of nodes in a network: subscriber nodes, which receive a unique key from the source node for every status update instantaneously, and nonsubscriber nodes, which receive a unique key for an update only if the node is selected by the source, and this selection is renewed for each update. For the message structure between nodes, we consider two different schemes: a memory scheme (in which the nodes keep the source's current and previous encrypted messages) and a memoryless scheme (in which the nodes are allowed to only keep the source's current message). We measure the timeliness of information updates by using a recent performance metric, the version age of information. We present explicit formulas for the time average AoI in a scalable homogeneous network as functions of the network parameters under a memoryless scheme. Additionally, we provide strict lower and upper bounds for the time average AoI under a memory scheme.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial descriptions of faces of the cone of supermodular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five different ways of combinatorial description of non-empty faces of the cone of supermodular functions on the power set of a finite basic set $N$ are introduced. Their identification with faces of the cone of supermodular games allows one to associate to them certain polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, known as cores (of these games) in context of cooperative game theory, or generalized permutohedra in context of polyhedral geometry. Non-empty faces of the supermodular cone then correspond to normal fans of those polytopes. This (basically) geometric way of description of faces of the cone then leads to the combinatorial ways of their description. The first combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain partitions of the set of enumerations of $N$, known as rank tests in context of algebraic statistics. The second combinatorial way is to identify faces with certain collections of posets on $N$, known as (complete) fans of posets in context of polyhedral geometry. The third combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain coverings of the power set of $N$, introduced relatively recently in context of cooperative game theory under name core structures. The fourth combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain formal conditional independence structures, introduced formerly in context of multivariate statistics under name structural semi-graphoids. The fifth way is to identify the faces with certain subgraphs of the permutohedral graph, whose nodes are enumerations of $N$. We prove the equivalence of those six ways of description of non-empty faces of the supermodular cone. This result also allows one to describe the faces of the polyhedral cone of (rank functions of) polymatroids over $N$ and the faces of the submodular cone over $N$.</description>

      <title>On warped product on information geometry: statistical manifolds and statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a differential geometric construction, the warped product, on the background geometry for information theory. Divergences, dual structures and symmetric 3-tensor are studied under this construction, and we show that warped product of manifolds endow with such structure also is endowed with the same geometric notion. However, warped product does not preserve canonical divergences, which in particular shows that warped product lacks of meaning in the information theory setting.</description>

      <title>Finite Field Multiple Access for Sourced Massive Random Access with Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For binary source transmission, this paper introduces the concept of element-pair (EP) and establishes that when the Cartesian product of $J$ distinct EPs satisfies the unique sum-pattern mapping (USPM) structural property, these $J$ EPs can form a uniquely-decodable EP (UD-EP) code. EPs are treated as virtual resources allocated to different users in finite fields, serving to distinguish users. This approach enables the reordering of multiplexing and channel encoding modules, effectively addressing the finite blocklength (FBL) challenge in multiuser reliable transmission. Next, we introduce an orthogonal EP code $\Psi_{\rm o, B}$ constructed over an extension field GF($2^m$). Using this EP code, we develop a time-division mode of finite-field multiple-access (FFMA) systems, consisting of sparse-form and diagonal-form structures. Based on the diagonal-form (DF) structure, we present a specific configuration, referred to as polarization-adjusted DF-FFMA, which can simultaneously obtain the power gain and coding gain from the entire blocklength. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FFMA systems significantly improve error performance over a Gaussian multiple-access channel, compared to a slotted ALOHA system.</description>

      <title>MIMO Precoding for Rydberg Atomic Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the strong atom-light interaction, a Rydberg atomic receiver can measure radio waves with extreme sensitivity. Existing research primarily focuses on improving the signal detection capability of atomic receivers, while traditional signal processing schemes at the transmitter side have remained unchanged. As a result, these schemes fail to maximize the throughput of atomic receivers, given that the coupling between atomic dipole moment and radio-wave magnitude results in a nonlinear transmission model in contrast to the traditional linear one. To address this issue, our work proposes to design customized precoding techniques for atomic multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems to achieve the channel capacity. A strong-reference approximation is initially proposed to linearize the nonlinear transition model of atomic receivers. This facilitates the derivation of atomic-MIMO channel capacity as $\min(N_r/2, N_t)\log({\rm SNR})$ at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for $N_r$ receive atomic antennas and $N_t$ classic transmit antennas. Then, a new digital precoding technique, termed In-phase-and-Quadrature (IQ) aware precoding is presented, which features independent processing of I/Q data streams using four real-valued matrices. The design is shown to be capacity-achieving for the atomic MIMO system. In addition, for the case of large-scale MIMO system, we extend the preceding fully-digital precoding design to the popular hybrid precoding architecture, which cascades a classical analog precoder with a low-dimensional version of the proposed IQ-aware digital precoder. By alternatively optimizing the digital and analog parts, the hybrid design is able to approach the performance of the optimal IQ-aware fully digital precoding. Simulation results validate the superiority of proposed IQ-aware precoding methods over existing techniques in the context of atomic MIMO communication.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a unification of distributed source coding, multiple description coding, and source coding with side information at decoders. The equivalence between the multiple-decoder extension of distributed source coding with decoder side information and the multiple-source extension of multiple description coding with decoder side information is clarified. Their multi-letter rate-distortion region for arbitrary general correlated sources is characterized in terms of entropy functions. We construct a code based on constrained-random number generators and show its achievability.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Disclosure Prevention with Pointwise Maximal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a paradigm shift in the way privacy is defined, driven by a novel interpretation of the fundamental result of Dwork and Naor about the impossibility of absolute disclosure prevention. We propose a general model of utility and privacy in which utility is achieved by disclosing the value of low-entropy features of a secret $X$, while privacy is maintained by hiding the value of high-entropy features of $X$. Adopting this model, we prove that, contrary to popular opinion, it is possible to provide meaningful inferential privacy guarantees. These guarantees are given in terms of an operationally-meaningful information measure called pointwise maximal leakage (PML) and prevent privacy breaches against a large class of adversaries regardless of their prior beliefs about $X$. We show that PML-based privacy is compatible with and provides insights into existing notions such as differential privacy. We also argue that our new framework enables highly flexible mechanism designs, where the randomness of a mechanism can be adjusted to the entropy of the data, ultimately, leading to higher utility.</description>

      <title>Reduced bit median quantization: A middle process for Efficient Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image compression techniques have made remarkable progress when it comes to file size reduction with a tolerable quality reduction; nonetheless, they are facing some challenges when it comes to applying more compression with the same perceptible quality or in accounting for specific use cases such as deep archive files and more efficient image transfers. Previous techniques have tried to solve the former problem by applying one specific or a combination of different algorithms. However, none of these methods were able to achieve additional file size reduction beyond a certain compression. I introduce Reduced Bit Median Quantization (RBMQ), a middle-process image compression technique designed to enhance file size reduction so that it can be stored with already existing file extension formats. In RBMQ by applying only the first step in which the quantization of valued further file size reduction can be achieved without a noticeable decrease in the image quality. Furthermore, more size reduction can be achieved by reducing the representing bits for the quantized values which can be optimal for deep archival storage or big-size image transfer in which the image quality is not suitable for the human eye since it is dark and dim but can be much efficient to interact with network and storage components later to be decoded to get the only quantized value image that almost the same quality with the original one. RBMQ introduces redundancy to the pixel values to be taken advantage of by existing compression techniques furthermore it introduces bit reduction from 8 to 5 bits for image file extensions such as jpeg which substantially reduces the file size to be used for JPEG file transfers and deep archive storage.</description>
