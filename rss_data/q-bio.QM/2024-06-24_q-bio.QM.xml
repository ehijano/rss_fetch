      <title>Geneverse: A collection of Open-source Multimodal Large Language Models for Genomic and Proteomic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) are promising for biomedical and healthcare research. Despite the availability of open-source LLMs trained using a wide range of biomedical data, current research on the applications of LLMs to genomics and proteomics is still limited. To fill this gap, we propose a collection of finetuned LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), known as Geneverse, for three novel tasks in genomic and proteomic research. The models in Geneverse are trained and evaluated based on domain-specific datasets, and we use advanced parameter-efficient finetuning techniques to achieve the model adaptation for tasks including the generation of descriptions for gene functions, protein function inference from its structure, and marker gene selection from spatial transcriptomic data. We demonstrate that adapted LLMs and MLLMs perform well for these tasks and may outperform closed-source large-scale models based on our evaluations focusing on both truthfulness and structural correctness. All of the training strategies and base models we used are freely accessible.</description>

      <title>Brain states analysis of EEG data distinguishes Multiple Sclerosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The treatment of multiple sclerosis implies, beside protecting the body, the preserving of mental functions, considering how adverse cognitive decay affects quality of life. However a cognitive assessment is nowadays still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on objective neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is in fact readily observable and readable.
  Objective: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms discriminate quantitatively normal from pathological patterns in the EEG signal.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82\% while using bands alone arrived at 64\%. A few feature combinations were identified to drive this distinction.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis distinguishes successfully controls from patients with MS. Our results imply that this data-driven cross-sectional comparison of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead in terms of quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope having established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Measures of Population Synchrony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronized behavior among individuals is a ubiquitous feature of populations. Understanding mechanisms of (de)synchronization demands meaningful, interpretable, computable quantifications of synchrony, relevant to measurements that can be made of dynamic populations. Despite the importance to analyzing and modeling populations, existing notions of synchrony often lack rigorous definitions, may be specialized to a particular experimental system and/or measurement, or may have undesirable properties that limit their utility. We introduce a notion of synchrony for populations of individuals occupying a compact metric space that depends on the Fr\'{e}chet variance of the distribution of individuals. We establish several fundamental and desirable mathematical properties of this synchrony measure, including continuity and invariance to metric scaling. We establish a general approximation result that controls the disparity between synchrony in the true space and the synchrony observed through a discretization of state space, as may occur when observable states are limited by measurement constraints. We develop efficient algorithms to compute synchrony in a variety of state spaces, including all finite state spaces and empirical distributions on the circle, and provide accessible implementations in an open-source Python module. To demonstrate the usefulness of the synchrony measure in biological applications, we investigate several biologically relevant models of mechanisms that can alter the dynamics of synchrony over time, and reanalyze published data concerning the dynamics of the intraerythrocytic developmental cycles of $\textit{Plasmodium}$ parasites. We anticipate that the rigorous definition of population synchrony and the mathematical and biological results presented here will be broadly useful in analyzing and modeling populations in a variety of contexts.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based inference, identifiability and prediction using count data from lattice-based random walk models</title>

Abstract: In vitro cell biology experiments are routinely used to characterize cell migration properties under various experimental conditions. These experiments can be interpreted using lattice-based random walk models to provide insight into underlying biological mechanisms, and continuum limit partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions of the stochastic models can be used to efficiently explore model properties instead of relying on repeated stochastic simulations. Working with efficient PDE models is of high interest for parameter estimation algorithms that typically require a large number of forward model simulations. Quantitative data from cell biology experiments usually involves non-negative cell counts in different regions of the experimental images, and it is not obvious how to relate finite, noisy count data to the solutions of continuous PDE models that correspond to noise-free density profiles. In this work we illustrate how to develop and implement likelihood-based methods for parameter estimation, parameter identifiability and model prediction for lattice-based models describing collective migration with an arbitrary number of interacting subpopulations. We implement a standard additive Gaussian measurement error model as well as a new physically-motivated multinomial measurement error model that relates noisy count data with the solution of continuous PDE models. Both measurement error models lead to similar outcomes for parameter estimation and parameter identifiability, whereas the standard additive Gaussian measurement error model leads to non-physical prediction outcomes. In contrast, the new multinomial measurement error model involves a lower computational overhead for parameter estimation and identifiability analysis, as well as leading to physically meaningful model predictions.</description>

      <title>A compact model of Escherichia coli core and biosynthetic metabolism</title>

Abstract: Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms of interest, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise, and occasionally generate hard-to-interpret or even biologically unrealistic predictions. Out of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred comprise the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Here, focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present a manually-curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied prokaryote Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations, as well as a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, here we assess the properties of this model in relation to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, we believe this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.</description>

      <title>Incorporating temporal dynamics of mutations to enhance the prediction capability of antiretroviral therapy's outcome for HIV-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: In predicting HIV therapy outcomes, a critical clinical question is whether using historical information can enhance predictive capabilities compared with current or latest available data analysis. This study analyses whether historical knowledge, which includes viral mutations detected in all genotypic tests before therapy, their temporal occurrence, and concomitant viral load measurements, can bring improvements. We introduce a method to weigh mutations, considering the previously enumerated factors and the reference mutation-drug Stanford resistance tables. We compare a model encompassing history (H) with one not using it (NH). Results: The H-model demonstrates superior discriminative ability, with a higher ROC-AUC score (76.34%) than the NH-model (74.98%). Significant Wilcoxon test results confirm that incorporating historical information improves consistently predictive accuracy for treatment outcomes. The better performance of the H-model might be attributed to its consideration of latent HIV reservoirs, probably obtained when leveraging historical information. The findings emphasize the importance of temporal dynamics in mutations, offering insights into HIV infection complexities. However, our result also shows that prediction accuracy remains relatively high even when no historical information is available. Supplementary information: Supplementary material is available.</description>

      <title>Prediction of causal genes at GWAS loci with pleiotropic gene regulatory effects using sets of correlated instrumental variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) is a statistical technique that uses sets of genetic instruments to estimate the direct causal effects of multiple exposures on an outcome of interest. At genomic loci with pleiotropic gene regulatory effects, that is, loci where the same genetic variants are associated to multiple nearby genes, MVMR can potentially be used to predict candidate causal genes. However, consensus in the field dictates that the genetic instruments in MVMR must be independent, which is usually not possible when considering a group of candidate genes from the same locus. We used causal inference theory to show that MVMR with correlated instruments satisfies the instrumental set condition. This is a classical result by Brito and Pearl (2002) for structural equation models that guarantees the identifiability of causal effects in situations where multiple exposures collectively, but not individually, separate a set of instrumental variables from an outcome variable. Extensive simulations confirmed the validity and usefulness of these theoretical results even at modest sample sizes. Importantly, the causal effect estimates remain unbiased and their variance small when instruments are highly correlated. We applied MVMR with correlated instrumental variable sets at risk loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for coronary artery disease using eQTL data from the STARNET study. Our method predicts causal genes at twelve loci, each associated with multiple colocated genes in multiple tissues. However, the extensive degree of regulatory pleiotropy across tissues and the limited number of causal variants in each locus still require that MVMR is run on a tissue-by-tissue basis, and testing all gene-tissue pairs at a given locus in a single model to predict causal gene-tissue combinations remains infeasible.</description>

      <title>Learning Molecular Representation in a Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug efficacy and safety in vivo requires information on biological responses (e.g., cell morphology and gene expression) to small molecule perturbations. However, current molecular representation learning methods do not provide a comprehensive view of cell states under these perturbations and struggle to remove noise, hindering model generalization. We introduce the Information Alignment (InfoAlign) approach to learn molecular representations through the information bottleneck method in cells. We integrate molecules and cellular response data as nodes into a context graph, connecting them with weighted edges based on chemical, biological, and computational criteria. For each molecule in a training batch, InfoAlign optimizes the encoder's latent representation with a minimality objective to discard redundant structural information. A sufficiency objective decodes the representation to align with different feature spaces from the molecule's neighborhood in the context graph. We demonstrate that the proposed sufficiency objective for alignment is tighter than existing encoder-based contrastive methods. Empirically, we validate representations from InfoAlign in two downstream tasks: molecular property prediction against up to 19 baseline methods across four datasets, plus zero-shot molecule-morphology matching.</description>
