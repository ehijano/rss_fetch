      <title>Understanding the Performance Behaviors of End-to-End Protein Design Pipelines on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent computational advances enable protein design pipelines to run end-to-end on GPUs, yet their heterogeneous computational behaviors remain undercharacterized at the system level. We implement and profile a representative pipeline at both component and full-pipeline granularities across varying inputs and hyperparameters. Our characterization identifies generally low GPU utilization and high sensitivity to sequence length and sampling strategies. We outline future research directions based on these insights and release an open-source pipeline and profiling scripts to facilitate further studies.</description>

      <title>How Do Ports Organise Innovation? Linking Port Governance, Ownership, and Living Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ports are pivotal to decarbonisation and resilience, yet port studies rarely examine how ownership and decision rights shape the process and outcomes of sustainability and digital pilots. Living Lab (LL) scholarship offers strong concepts, but limited sector-grounded explanation of LL-governance fit in ports. We develop and apply a governance-LL fit framework linking port governance and ownership to four LL pillars: co-creation, real-life setting, iterative learning, and institutional embedding (multi-level decision-making). We apply the framework in a comparative case study of two analytically contrasting ports, anchored in port-defined priorities: an Energy Community pilot in Aalborg and a Green Coordinator function in Trelleborg. Using an LL macro-meso-micro lens, we distinguish the stable constellation of actors and mandates (macro), the governance of specific projects (meso), and the methods used to generate and test solutions (micro). Findings show that Landlord governance offers contract- and procurement-based landing zones (concessions/leases and tender clauses) that can codify LL outputs and support scaling across tenants and infrastructures. Tool/Public Service governance embeds learning mainly through SOPs, procurement specifications, and municipal coordination, enabling internal operational gains but limiting external codification without bespoke agreements. Across both ports, key needs are clear role definition, sustained stakeholder engagement, and timely alignment with decision windows. Overall, LL effectiveness is governance-contingent, reflecting where decision rights sit and which instruments embed learning into routine practice.</description>

      <title>Resilience by Design: A KPI for Heavy-Duty Megawatt Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a stressor-agnostic Resilience Key Performance Indicator (Resilience KPI) for megawatt charging stations (MSC) serving heavy-duty vehicles. Beyond routine performance statistics (e.g., availability, throughput), the KPI quantifies a site's ability to anticipate, operate under degradation, and recover from disruptions using observable signals already in the framework: ride-through capability, restoration speed, service under N-1, expected unserved charging energy, and queue impacts. The headline score is normalised to 0-100 for fair cross-site and cross-vendor benchmarking, with optional stressor-specific breakouts (grid, ICT, thermal, flooding, on-site incidents) for diagnostics and robustness checks. DATEX II provides a solid baseline for resilience KPIs centred on infrastructure inventory, status, and pricing, while additional KPIs, especially around grid capacity, on-site flexibility, heavy-vehicle geometry, environmental hardening, maintenance, and market exposure, are essential for a complete resilience picture and will require extensions or complementary data sources. The KPI is designed for monthly/quarterly reporting to support design and operational decisions and cost-benefit assessment of mitigations (e.g., backup power, spares, procedures). It offers a consistent, transparent methodology that consolidates heterogeneous logs and KPIs into a single, auditable indicator, making resilience comparable across sites, vendors, and jurisdictions.</description>

      <title>XBTorch: A Unified Framework for Modeling and Co-Design of Crossbar-Based Deep Learning Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging memory technologies have gained significant attention as a promising pathway to overcome the limitations of conventional computing architectures in deep learning applications. By enabling computation directly within memory, these technologies - built on nanoscale devices with tunable and nonvolatile conductance - offer the potential to drastically reduce energy consumption and latency compared to traditional von Neumann systems. This paper introduces XBTorch (short for CrossBarTorch), a novel simulation framework that integrates seamlessly with PyTorch and provides specialized tools for accurately and efficiently modeling crossbar-based systems based on emerging memory technologies. Through detailed comparisons and case studies involving hardware-aware training and inference, we demonstrate how XBTorch offers a unified interface for key research areas such as device-level modeling, cross-layer co-design, and inference-time fault tolerance. While exemplar studies utilize ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) models, the framework remains technology-agnostic - supporting other emerging memories such as resistive RAM (ReRAM), as well as enabling user-defined custom device models. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ADAM-Lab-GW/xbtorch</description>

      <title>TranSC: Hardware-Aware Design of Transcendental Functions Using Stochastic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardware-friendly implementation of transcendental functions remains a longstanding challenge in design automation. These functions, which cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations, pose significant complexity in digital circuit design. This study introduces a novel approach, TranSC, that utilizes stochastic computing (SC) for lightweight yet accurate implementation of transcendental functions. Building on established SC techniques, our method explores alternative random sources-specifically, quasi-random Van der Corput low-discrepancy (LD) sequences-instead of conventional pseudo-randomness. This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions. The proposed design approach significantly reduces MSE by up to 98% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions while reducing hardware area, power consumption, and energy usage by 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Personalized Spiking Neural Networks with Ferroelectric Synapses for EEG Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00020v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.</description>

      <title>VIPER Strike: Defeating Visual Reasoning CAPTCHAs via Structured Vision-Language Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Reasoning CAPTCHAs (VRCs) combine visual scenes with natural-language queries that demand compositional inference over objects, attributes, and spatial relations. They are increasingly deployed as a primary defense against automated bots. Existing solvers fall into two paradigms: vision-centric, which rely on template-specific detectors but fail on novel layouts, and reasoning-centric, which leverage LLMs but struggle with fine-grained visual perception. Both lack the generality needed to handle heterogeneous VRC deployments.
  We present ViPer, a unified attack framework that integrates structured multi-object visual perception with adaptive LLM-based reasoning. ViPer parses visual layouts, grounds attributes to question semantics, and infers target coordinates within a modular pipeline. Evaluated on six major VRC providers (VTT, Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, Shumei, Xiaodun), ViPer achieves up to 93.2% success, approaching human-level performance across multiple benchmarks. Compared to prior solvers, GraphNet (83.2%), Oedipus (65.8%), and the Holistic approach (89.5%), ViPer consistently outperforms all baselines. The framework further maintains robustness across alternative LLM backbones (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Kimi), sustaining accuracy above 90%.
  To anticipate defense, we further introduce Template-Space Randomization (TSR), a lightweight strategy that perturbs linguistic templates without altering task semantics. TSR measurably reduces solver (i.e., attacker) performance. Our proposed design suggests directions for human-solvable but machine-resistant CAPTCHAs.</description>

      <title>A novel RF-enabled Non-Destructive Inspection Method through Machine Learning and Programmable Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary industrial Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods require sensing capabilities that operate in occluded, hazardous, or access restricted environments. Yet, the current visual inspection based on optical cameras offers limited quality of service to that respect. In that sense, novel methods for workpiece inspection, suitable, for smart manufacturing are needed. Programmable Wireless Environments (PWE) could help towards that direction, by redefining the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) wave propagation as a controllable inspector entity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Non-Destructive Inspection, leveraging an RF sensing pipeline based on RF wavefront encoding for retrieving workpiece-image entries from a designated database. This approach combines PWE-enabled RF wave manipulation with machine learning (ML) tools trained to produce visual outputs for quality inspection. Specifically, we establish correlation relationships between RF wavefronts and target industrial assets, hence yielding a dataset which links wavefronts to their corresponding images in a structured manner. Subsequently, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) derives visual representations closely matching the database entries. Our results indicate that the proposed method achieves an SSIM 99.5% matching score in visual outputs, paving the way for next-generation quality control workflows in industry.</description>

Abstract: In the high-altitude territories of the Andean-Amazonian-Atlantic pathway, data is not merely a digital resource but an extension of Khipu Panaka, the genealogical and relational memory of the Kara-Kichwa Republics. This perspective paper introduces the Kara-Kichwa Data Sovereignty Framework, a living instrument designed to counteract the "intellectual gentrification" and systemic invisibility of Andean Indigenous Peoples in global data ecosystems. Grounded in Indigenous legal systems thinking, the framework codifies five customary pillars, Kamachy (Self-determination), Ayllu-llaktapak kamachy (Collective Authority), Tantanakuy (Relational Accountability), Willay-panka-tantay (Ancestral Memory), and Sumak Kawsay (Biocultural Ethics), to govern the lifecycle of data from generation to expiration.</description>

      <title>Resource-Aware Task Allocator Design: Insights and Recommendations for Distributed Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design of a Resource-Aware Task Allocator (RATA) and an empirical analysis in handling real-time tasks for processing on Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). We consider task processing performance across low Earth orbit (LEO) to Low-Medium Earth Orbit (Low-MEO) constellation sizes, under varying traffic loads. Using Single-Level Tree Network(SLTN)-based cooperative task allocation architecture, we attempt to evaluate some key performance metrics - blocking probabilities, response times, energy consumption, and resource utilization across several tens of thousands of tasks per experiment. Our resource-conscious RATA monitors key parameters such as arrival rate, resources (on-board compute, storage, bandwidth, battery) availability, satellite eclipses' influence in processing and communications. This study is an important step towards analyzing the performance under lighter to stress inducing levels of compute intense workloads to test the ultimate performance limits under the combined influence of the above-mentioned factors. Results show pronounced non-linear scaling: while capacity increases with constellation size, blocking and delay grow rapidly, whereas energy remains resilient under solar-aware scheduling. The analysis identifies a practical satellite-count limit for baseline SLTNs and demonstrates that CPU availability, rather than energy, is the primary cause of blocking. These findings provide quantitative guidance by identifying thresholds at which system performance shifts from graceful degradation to collapse.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin for Ultra-Reliable &amp; Low-Latency 6G Wireless Communications in Dense Urban City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency deployments in dense cities are difficult to plan because coverage, interference, and service reliability depend sensitively on local morphology. This paper develops a geometric Digital Twin (DT) of the Sunway City and uses it to study the service implications of a multi-site mmWave deployment. The DT is constructed from geo-referenced three-dimensional meshes of buildings, roads, and open areas, assembled in Blender and exported as a mesh scene. A seven-transmitter downlink at 10 GHz is then embedded into this geometry and evaluated using a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine that returns path-gain and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) fields over a dense grid of user locations. These fields are mapped to achievable throughput and compared against representative target rates for immersive extended reality (XR), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The resulting maps show that favourable streets and courtyards form narrow high rate corridors surrounded by deep shadows, even within a dense area. In the baseline deployment, one fifth of the simulated area can maintain 100 Mbps URLLC rates, and less than 10% of cells can reach 1.7 Gbps for XR, despite the presence of several rooftop sites. By exploiting the DT, we further quantify the macro-diversity margin between the best and second best serving sites and show that most URLLC-feasible cells have several decibels of SINR headroom that could be harvested through dual connectivity. The study shows how a city DT can translate ray tracing output into service centric metrics and planning insights, complementing both analytical models and expensive measurement campaigns.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware LoRaWAN Gateway Placement in Dense Urban Cities Using Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LoRaWAN deployments rely on rough range estimates or simplified propagation models to decide where to place/mount gateways. As a result, operators have limited visibility into how rooftop choice, streets, and building shadowing jointly affect coverage and reliability. This paper addresses the problem of gateway placement in dense urban environments by combining a geometry accurate Digital Twin (DT) with a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine. Existing studies optimize placement on abstract grids or tune models with sparse measurements; few works evaluate LoRaWAN gateways on a full 3D city model using a realistic link budget. In this paper, we develop a DT with ITU radio materials and evaluate eight candidate rooftops for RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro gateways under a sub-GHz link budget derived from the data sheet. For each rooftop, we obtain Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) on a 5 meter grid, derive robust and edge coverage indicators, and apply a greedy maximum coverage algorithm to rank sites and quantify the benefit of incremental densification. Results show that a single rooftop gateway covers one fifth of the full Sunway twin (i.e., the DT) at a robust SNR threshold, and that six sites still leave large areas of single gateway or out of coverage cells in surrounding residential streets. The findings from this paper shows that DT and ray tracing tools enable network operators to bridge the gap of expensive real-world trials and planning to identify if the planned LoRaWAN gateway is sufficient or additional sites are required.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Computing with an Electro-Optic Analog Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains &gt;90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS compatible platform</title>

Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only 40 nm CMOS process node, orchestrated by an optoelectronic version of systolic array with no data skew and negligible propagation delay, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm^2. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.
  Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a custom printed circuit board (PCB) for a low-power and high-speed accelerator of NP-Hard graph problems. The architecture implements an annealing-based computing paradigm using a network of nonlinear electronic oscillators whose phase dynamics converge to stable configurations that encode solutions. We review the theoretical framework, and present our circuit design, simulations, and experimental results. We further highlight some key future research directions for the emerging developing of computing architectures based on energy minimization.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional Autoscaling of Processing Services: A Comparison of Agent-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.</description>
