      <title>On the stability-instability transition in large Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-energy spectrum of large Bose-Fermi mixtures. In the chosen scaling, the fermions induce an effective attraction among the bosons, which competes with their intrinsic repulsive interaction. Our main result demonstrates the convergence of the eigenvalues towards those of an effective Bose Hamiltonian. For short-range potentials, we apply this result to derive a stability-instability transition in the bosonic subsystem, driven by the Bose-Fermi coupling strength $g$. For small $|g|$, the bosons form a stable Bose-Einstein condensate with the energy per particle uniformly bounded from below. For large $|g|$, the energy per particle is no longer uniformly bounded from below, signalling the collapse of the condensate.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Field Theory with vacuum and its Virasoro constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers on {\it Virasoro constraints for Cohomological Field Theory (CohFT)}. For a CohFT with vacuum, we introduce the concepts of $S$-calibration and $\nu$-calibration. Then, we define the (formal) total descendent potential corresponding to a given calibration. Finally, we introduce an additional structure, namely homogeneity, for both the CohFT and the calibrations.
  After these preliminary introductions, we propose two crucial conjectures: (1) the ancestor version of the Virasoro conjecture for the homogeneous CohFT with vacuum; and (2) the generalized Virasoro conjecture for the (formal) total descendent potential of a calibrated homogeneous CohFT. We verify the genus-0 part of these conjectures and deduce a simplified form of the genus-1 part of these conjectures for arbitrary CohFTs. Additionally, we prove the full conjectures for semisimple CohFTs.
  As applications, our results yield the Virasoro constraints for the deformed negative $r$-spin theory. Moreover, by applying the Virasoro constraints, we discover an extension of Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants theory which is widely studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative distance zeta functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [5] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [2].</description>

      <title>Existence of global solutions to the massive Thirring model in the non-laboratory coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive Thirring model in the non-laboratory coordinates is considered by the Riemann-Hilbert approach. Existence of global solutions is shown for the cases of the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem without eigenvalues or resonances. The Lipschitz continuity of the map from the potential $v_0(x)\in H^2(\mathbb{R})\cap H^{1,1}(\mathbb{R})$ to the scattering data is given in the direct scattering transform. Two transform matrices are introduced to curb the convergence of the Volterra integral equations and the relevant estimates of the modified Jost functions. For small potential, the solvability of the Riemann-Hilbert problems without eigenvalues or resonances is discussed. The Lipschitz continuity of the map from the scattering data to the potential $v(x)$ is shown. The reconstructions for potential $u(x,t)$ and $v(x,t)$ are finished by considering the time dependence of the scattering data and by constructing the conservation laws obtain via the dressing method.</description>

      <title>3D Conformal Field Theory in Twistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study three dimensional Lorentzian conformal field theories in twistor space. We formulate the conformal Ward identities and solve for two and three point Lorentzian Wightman functions. We found that the Helicity operators apart from the conformal generators play an important role in fixing their functional form. The equations take the form of first order Euler equations which in addition to the usual solutions that are polynomials, also possess weak solutions which are distributional in nature. All of these play an important role in our analysis. For instance, in the case of three point functions, the distributional solutions are indeed the ones realized by the CFT correlators. We also extend our analysis to parity odd Wightman functions which take an interesting form in twistor space. We verify our results by systematically analyzing the corresponding Wightman functions in momentum space and spinor helicity variables and matching with the twistor results via a half-Fourier transform.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Kac model for the space-homogeneous Landau equation with the Coulomb potential. We show that the Fisher information of the Liouville equation for the unmodified $N$-particle system is monotonically decreasing in time. The monotonicity ensures the compactness to derive a weak solution of the Landau hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A new asymptotic regime for the KdV equation with Wigner-von Neumann type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the KdV equation, focusing on the evolution of the radiant wave associated with a Wigner-von Neumann (WvN) resonance induced by the initial data (potential). A WvN resonance refers to an energy level where the potential exhibits zero transmission (complete reflection). The corresponding Jost solution at such energy becomes singular, and in the NLS context, this is referred to as a spectral singularity. A WvN resonance represents a long-range phenomenon, often introducing significant challenges, such as an infinite negative spectrum, when employing the inverse scattering transform (IST). To avoid some of these issues, we consider a restricted class of initial data that generates a WvN resonance but for which the IST framework can be suitably adapted. For this class of potentials, we demonstrate that each WvN resonance produces a distinct asymptotic regime -- termed the resonance regime -- characterized by a slower decay rate for large time compared to the radiant waves associated with short-range initial data.</description>

      <title>Twisting $\mathcal{O}$-operators by $(2,3)$-Cocycle of Hom-Lie-Yamaguti Algebras with Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of twisted $\mathcal O$-operators on a Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebra by a given $(2,3)$-cocycle with coefficients in a representation. We show that a twisted $\mathcal O$-operator induces a Hom-Lie-Yamaguti structure. We also introduce the notion of a weighted Reynolds operator on a Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebra, which can serve as a special case of twisted $\mathcal O$-operators on Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebras. Then, we define a cohomology of twisted $\mathcal O$-operator on Hom-Lie-Yamaguiti algebras with coefficients in a representation. Furthermore, we introduce and study the Hom-NS-Lie-Yamaguti algebras as the underlying structure of the twisted $\mathcal O$-operator on Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebras. Finally, we investigate the twisted $\mathcal O$-operator on Hom-Lie-Yamaguti algebras induced by the twisted $\mathcal O$-operator on a Hom-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Calogero-Sutherland-type quantum systems, generalized hypergeometric functions and superintegrability for integral chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the Calogero-Sutherland-type (CS-type) models and generalized hypergeometric functions. We construct the generalized CS operators for circular, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel cases and establish the generalized Lasselle-Nekrasov correspondence. To analyze the properties of CS operators and the generalized hypergeometric functions, the $\hat W$-operators and $\hat O$-operator are constructed based on the $\mathbf{SH}_N$ algebra. For the generalized hypergeometric functions, we present their $O$-representations in terms of $\hat O$-operator and give a family of constraints, where the constraint operators are given by the $\hat W$-operators. We analyze the superintegrability for the $\beta$-deformed integrals, where the measures are associated with the corresponding ground state wave functions of Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel type CS models. Then based on the generalized Laplace transformation of Jack polynomials, we construct two integral chains. One of which is a superintegrable model and equal to the generalized hypergeometric function. Another one is the skew version of the previous integral chain.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel application of the Flexible Foil Mesh Generation (FFMG) method to model the $3D$ Focal Body generated by a spherical mirror collecting light from an infinitely distant source on its optical axis. The study addresses the challenge of accurately representing highly concave structures formed by the focusing effect. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the FFMG method in capturing the intricate geometry of the Focal Body, with implications for computational geometry, $3D$ reconstruction, and optical system modeling.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The differential equations of the Wilson renormalization group are a powerful tool to study the Schwinger functions of Euclidean quantum field theory. In particular renormalization theory can be based entirely on inductively bounding their perturbatively expanded solutions. Recently the solutions of these equations for scalar field theory have been analysed rigorously without recourse to perturbation theory, at the cost of restricting to the mean-field approximation. In particular it was shown there that one-component $\varphi^4_4$-theory is trivial if the bare coupling constant of the UV regularized theory is not large. This paper presents progress w.r.t. Kopper's previous paper on asymptotically free solutions of the mean-field scalar flow equations: 1. The upper bound on the bare coupling is sent to infinity and the proof is extended to $O(N)$ vector models. 2. The unphysical infrared cutoff used for technical simplicity is replaced by a physical mass.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the critical behavior of multi-matrix models</title>

Abstract: Given a matrix model, by combining the Schwinger-Dyson equations with positivity constraints on its solutions, in the large $N$ limit one is able to obtain explicit and numerical bounds on its moments. This technique is known as bootstrapping with positivity. In this paper we use this technique to estimate the critical points and exponents of several multi-matrix models. As a proof of concept, we first show it can be used to find the well-studied quartic single matrix model's critical phenomena. We then apply the method to several similar ``unsolved" 2-matrix models with various quartic interactions. We conjecture and present strong evidence for the string susceptibility exponent for some of these models to be $\gamma = 1/2$, which heuristically indicates that the continuum limit will likely be the Continuum Random Tree. For the other 2-matrix models, we find estimates of new string susceptibility exponents that may indicate a new continuum limit. We then study an unsolved 3-matrix model that generalizes the 3-colour model with cubic interactions. Additionally, for all of these models, we are able to derive explicitly the first several terms of the free energy in the large $N$ limit as a power series expansion in the coupling constants at zero by exploiting the structure of the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

Abstract: We present a rigorous construction of the Feynman integral on the compactified Einstein Universe (EU) using white noise calculus.

Abstract: A GL$(n)$ quantum integrable system generalizing the asymmetric five vertex spin chain is shown to encode the ring relations of the equivariant quantum cohomology and equivariant quantum K-theory ring of flag varieties.

      <title>Higher-order continuum models for twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-order continuum PDE model proposed by Bistritzer and MacDonald in \cite{bistritzer2011moire} accurately describes the single-particle electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at small twist angles. In this paper, we obtain higher-order corrections to the Bistritzer-MacDonald model via a systematic multiple-scales expansion. We prove that the solution of the resulting higher-order PDE model accurately approximates the corresponding tight-binding wave function under a natural choice of parameters and given initial conditions that are spectrally localized to the monolayer Dirac points. Numerical simulations of tight-binding and continuum dynamics demonstrate the validity of the higher-order continuum model. Symmetries of the higher-order models are also discussed. This work extends the analysis from \cite{watson2023bistritzer}, which rigorously established the validity of the (first-order) BM model.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notion of regularized integrals introduced by Li-Zhou that aims to assign finite values to divergent integrals on configuration spaces of Riemann surfaces. We then give cohomological formulations for the extended notion using the tools of current cohomology and mixed Hodge structures. We also provide practical ways of constructing representatives of the corresponding cohomology classes in terms of smooth differential forms.</description>

      <title>Remark on the local well-posedness of compressible non-Newtonian fluids with initial vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss in this short note the local-in-time strong well-posedness of the compressible Navier-Stokes system for non-Newtonian fluids on the three dimensional torus. We show that the result established recently by Kalousek, M\'{a}cha, and Ne\v{c}asova in \doi{10.1007/s00208-021-02301-8} can be extended to the case where vanishing density is allowed initially. Our proof builds on the framework developed by Cho, Choe, and Kim in \doi{10.1016/j.matpur.2003.11.004} for compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the case of Newtonian fluids. To adapt their method, special attention is given to the elliptic regularity of a challenging nonlinear elliptic system. We show particular results in this direction, however, the main result of this paper is proven in the general case when elliptic $W^{2,p}$-regularity is imposed as an assumption. Also, we give a finite time blow-up criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>

      <title>Clifford operations and homological codes for rotors and oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07679v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop quantum information processing primitives for the planar rotor, the state space of a particle on a circle. By interpreting rotor wavefunctions as periodically identified wavefunctions of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the group of bosonic Gaussian operations inherited by the rotor. This $n$-rotor Clifford group, $\text{U}(1)^{n(n+1)/2} \rtimes \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, is represented by continuous $\text{U}(1)$ gates generated by polynomials quadratic in angular momenta, as well as discrete $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ momentum sign-flip and sum gates. We classify homological rotor error-correcting codes [arXiv:2303.13723] and various rotor states based on equivalence under Clifford operations.
  Reversing direction, we map homological rotor codes and rotor Clifford operations back into oscillators by interpreting occupation-number states as rotor states of non-negative angular momentum. This yields new multimode homological bosonic codes protecting against dephasing and changes in occupation number, along with their corresponding encoding and decoding circuits. In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post selection. We also outline several rotor and oscillator varieties of the GKP-stabilizer codes [arXiv:1903.12615].</description>

      <title>The three limits of the hydrostatic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primitive equations are derived from the $3D$-Navier-Stokes equations by the hydrostatic approximation. Formally, assuming an $\varepsilon$-thin domain and anisotropic viscosities with vertical viscosity $\nu_z=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\gamma)$ where $\gamma=2$, one obtains the primitive equations with full viscosity as $\varepsilon\to 0$. Here, we take two more limit equations into consideration: For $\gamma&lt;2$ the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. For $\gamma&gt;2$ the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity $-\Delta_H$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$. Thus, there are three possible limits of the hydrostatic approximation depending on the assumption on the vertical viscosity. The latter convergence has been proven recently by Li, Titi, and Yuan using energy estimates. Here, we consider more generally $\nu_z=\varepsilon^2 \delta$ and show how maximal regularity methods and quadratic inequalities can be an efficient approach to the same end for $\varepsilon,\delta\to 0$. The flexibility of our methods is also illustrated by the convergence for $\delta\to \infty$ and $\varepsilon\to 0$ to the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Initial data for Minkowski stability with arbitrary decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and parametrize solutions to the constraint equations of general relativity in a neighborhood of Minkowski spacetime with arbitrary prescribed decay properties at infinity. We thus provide a large class of initial data for the results on stability of Minkowski which include a mass term in the asymptotics. Due to the symmetries of Minkowski, a naive linear perturbation fails. Our construction is based on a simplified conformal method, a reduction to transverse traceless perturbations and a nonlinear fixed point argument where we face linear obstructions coming from the cokernels of both the linearized constraint operator and the Laplace operator. To tackle these obstructions, we introduce a well-chosen truncated black hole around which to perturb. The control of the parameters of the truncated black hole is the most technical part of the proof, since its center of mass and angular momentum could be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Kinetic data-driven approach to turbulence subgrid modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows are well known to pose extreme computational challenges due to the huge number of dynamical degrees of freedom required to correctly describe the complex multi-scale statistical correlations of the velocity. On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows, stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here we demonstrate that, by properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach towards subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically we show that by leveraging on data from fully resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky model, being less dissipative and, therefore, being able to more closely capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations. This foundational work lays the basis for extending the proposed framework to different turbulent flow settings and -- most importantly -- to develop new classes of hybrid data-driven kinetic-based models capable of faithfully capturing the complex macroscopic dynamics of diverse physical systems such as emulsions, non-Newtonian fluid and multiphase systems.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a quantum Markovian noise model, we study the maximum dimension of a classical or quantum system that can be stored for arbitrarily large time. We show that, unlike the fixed time setting, in the limit of infinite time, the classical and quantum capacities are characterized by efficiently computable properties of the peripheral spectrum of the quantum channel. In addition, the capacities are additive under tensor product, which implies in the language of Shannon theory that the one-shot and the asymptotic i.i.d. capacities are the same. We also provide an improved algorithm for computing the structure of the peripheral subspace of a quantum channel, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using techniques proposed in [Sason, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 59, 7118 (2013)] and [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)], and based on the results from the latter, we construct a globally optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy. This bound applies to any state under energy constraints imposed by arbitrary Hamiltonians that satisfy the Gibbs hypothesis. This completely solves the problem of finding an optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in this setting, previously known only for pairs of states that are sufficiently close to each other. Our main technical result, a globally optimal semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under general energy constraints, leads to this continuity bound. To prove it, we also derive an optimal Fano-type inequality for random variables with a countably infinite alphabet and a general constraint, as well as optimal semicontinuity and continuity bounds for the Shannon entropy in the same setting. In doing so, we improve the results derived in [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Shell Models on Recurrent Sequences: Fibonacci, Padovan and Other Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of shell models is proposed, where the shell variables are defined on a recurrent sequence of integer wave-numbers such as the Fibonacci or the Padovan series, or their variations including a sequence made of square roots of Fibonacci numbers rounded to the nearest integer. Considering the simplest model, which involves only local interactions, the interaction coefficients can be generalized in such a way that the inviscid invariants, such as energy and helicity, can be conserved even though there is no exact self-similarity. It is shown that these models basically have identical features with standard shell models, and produce the same power law spectra, similar spectral fluxes and analogous deviation from self-similar scaling of the structure functions implying comparable levels of turbulent intermittency. Such a formulation potentially opens up the possibility of using shell models, or their generalizations along with discretized regular grids, such as those found in direct numerical simulations, either as diagnostic tools, or subgrid models. It also allows to develop models where the wave-number shells can be interpreted as sparsely decimated sets of wave-numbers over an initially regular grid. In addition to conventional shell models with local interactions that result in forward cascade, a particular helical shell model with long range interactions is considered on a similarly recurrent sequence of wave numbers, corresponding to the Fibonacci series, and found to result in the usual inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dilaton-induced variations in Planck constant and speed of light: An alternative to Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a novel aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to couple with a dilaton field: $\,$The dynamics of the dilaton can induce variations in the Planck constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. $\,$Our mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$ spacetimes via the dilaton offers a viable alternative account for late-time cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Emergent AdS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a $\textit{Twisted Modular Inclusion}$ and a $\textit{Twisted Modular Intersection}$ property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Semi-Quenched Invariance Principle for the Random Lorentz Gas -- Beyond the Boltzmann-Grad Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By synchronously coupling multiple Lorentz trajectories exploring the same environment consisting of randomly placed scatterers in R^3 we upgrade the annealed invariance principle proved in [C. Lutsko, B. T\'oth, Commun. Math. Phys. 379 589-632 (2020)] to quenched setting (that is, valid for almost all realizations of the environment) along sufficiently fast extractor sequences.</description>
