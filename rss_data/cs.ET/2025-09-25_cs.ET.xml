      <title>High Clockrate Free-space Optical In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to process and act on data in real time is increasingly critical for applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, three-dimensional environmental sensing and remote robotics. However, the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in edge devices is hindered by the lack of energy-efficient scalable computing hardware. Here, we introduce a fanout spatial time-of-flight optical neural network (FAST-ONN) that calculates billions of convolutions per second with ultralow latency and power consumption. This is enabled by the combination of high-speed dense arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for input modulation with spatial light modulators of high pixel counts for in-memory weighting. In a three-dimensional optical system, parallel differential readout allows signed weight values accurate inference in a single shot. The performance is benchmarked with feature extraction in You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) for convolution at 100 million frames per second (MFPS), and in-system backward propagation training with photonic reprogrammability. The VCSEL transmitters are implementable in any free-space optical computing systems to improve the clockrate to over gigahertz. The high scalability in device counts and channel parallelism enables a new avenue to scale up free space computing hardware.</description>

      <title>HARLI CQUINN: Higher Adjusted Randomness with Linear In Complexity QUantum INspired Networks for K-Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19395v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contrast a minimalistic implementation of quantum k-means algorithm to classical k-means algorithm. With classical simulation results, we demonstrate a quantum performance, on and above par, with the classical k-means algorithm. We present benchmarks of its accuracy for test cases of both well-known and experimental datasets. Despite extensive research into quantum k-means algorithms, our approach reveals previously unexplored methodological improvements. The encoding step can be minimalistic with classical data imported into quantum states more directly than existing approaches. The proposed quantum-inspired algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) with respect to the bare classical k-means algorithm. By investigating multiple encoding strategies, we provide nuanced insights into quantum computational clustering techniques.</description>

      <title>Digital Signal Processing from Classical Coherent Systems to Continuous-Variable QKD: A Review of Cross-Domain Techniques, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review investigates the application of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques -- originally developed for coherent optical communication systems to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). The convergence of these domains has enabled significant advances in CV-QKD performance, particularly in phase synchronization, polarization tracking, and excess noise mitigation. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis of this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented framework adapted from the PRISMA protocol. A structured search across IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases (2021-2025) yielded 220 relevant publications, which were screened, classified, and analyzed to address six research questions. Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms, such as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and machine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to the quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise constraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent optical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD integration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint retiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in achieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with classical channels. This review maps current trends, technical barriers, and emerging opportunities at the intersection of signal processing for quantum and classical communication, supporting the development of scalable and resilient CV-QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop control of seizure activity via real-time seizure forecasting by reservoir neuromorphic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop brain stimulation holds potential as personalized treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) but still suffers from limitations that result in highly variable efficacy. First, stimulation is typically delivered upon detection of the seizure to abort rather than prevent it; second, the stimulation parameters are established by trial and error, requiring lengthy rounds of fine-tuning, which delay steady-state therapeutic efficacy. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging the potential of neuromorphic computing. We present a neuromorphic reservoir computing hardware system capable of driving real-time personalized free-run stimulations based on seizure forecasting, wherein each forecast triggers an electrical pulse rather than an arbitrarily predefined fixed-frequency stimulus train. The system achieves 83.33% accuracy in forecasting seizure occurrences during the training phase. We validate the system using hippocampal spheroids coupled to 3D microelectrode array as a simplified testbed, achieving seizure reduction &gt;97% during the real-time processing while primarily using instantaneous stimulation frequencies within 20 Hz, well below what typically used in clinical practice. Our work demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic systems as a next-generation neuromodulation strategy for personalized DRE treatment, leveraging their sparse and event-driven processing for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Online Event Downsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis, enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this, prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead, we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining performance under event-budget constraints.

      <title>An Empirical Study of Testing Practices in Open Source AI Agent Frameworks and Agentic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation model (FM)-based AI agents are rapidly gaining adoption across diverse domains, but their inherent non-determinism and non-reproducibility pose testing and quality assurance challenges. While recent benchmarks provide task-level evaluations, there is limited understanding of how developers verify the internal correctness of these agents during development.
  To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of testing practices in the AI agent ecosystem, analyzing 39 open-source agent frameworks and 439 agentic applications. We identify ten distinct testing patterns and find that novel, agent-specific methods like DeepEval are seldom used (around 1%), while traditional patterns like negative and membership testing are widely adapted to manage FM uncertainty. By mapping these patterns to canonical architectural components of agent frameworks and agentic applications, we uncover a fundamental inversion of testing effort: deterministic components like Resource Artifacts (tools) and Coordination Artifacts (workflows) consume over 70% of testing effort, while the FM-based Plan Body receives less than 5%. Crucially, this reveals a critical blind spot, as the Trigger component (prompts) remains neglected, appearing in around 1% of all tests.
  Our findings offer the first empirical testing baseline in FM-based agent frameworks and agentic applications, revealing a rational but incomplete adaptation to non-determinism. To address it, framework developers should improve support for novel testing methods, application developers must adopt prompt regression testing, and researchers should explore barriers to adoption. Strengthening these practices is vital for building more robust and dependable AI agents.</description>
