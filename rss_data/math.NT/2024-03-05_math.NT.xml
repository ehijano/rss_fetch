      <title>The distribution of $a$-numbers of hyperelliptic curves in characteristic three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new approach to counting the proportion of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with a given $a$-number. In characteristic three this method gives exact probabilities for curves of the form $Y^2=f(X)$ with $f(X)\in\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ monic and cubefree, probabilities that match the data presented by Cais et al. in previous work. These results are sufficient to derive precise estimates (in terms of $q$) for these probabilities when restricting to squarefree $f$. As a consequence, for positive integers $a$ and $g$ we show that the nonempty strata of the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ consisting of those curves with $a$-number $a$ are of codimension $2a-1$. This contrasts with the analogous result for the moduli space of abelian varieties in which the codimensions of the strata are $a(a+1)/2$. Finally, our results allow for an alternative heuristic conjecture to that of Cais et al.; one that matches the available data.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic central Bell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let Y be a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. In this paper, we study the probabilistic central Bell polynomials associated with random variable Y, as probabilistic extension of the central Bell polynomials. In addition, we investigate the probabilistic central factorial numbers of the second kind associated with Y and the probabilistic central Fubini polynomials associated with Y. The aim of this paper is to derive some properties, explicit expressions, certain identities and recurrence relations for those polynomials and numbers.</description>

      <title>On an estimate on G\"otzky's domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental domain $F\subset H^2$ for the Hilbert modular group belonging to the quadratic number field $Q(\sqrt{5})$ was constructed by G\"otzky almost a hundred years ago. He also gave a lower bound for the height $y_1y_2$ of the points $(z_1,z_2)=(x_1+iy_1,x_2+iy_2)\in F$. Later Gundlach used analogous domains and estimates for other fields as well to give a complete list of totally elliptic conjugacy classes in some Hilbert modular groups, while not long ago Deutsch analysed two of these domains by numerical computations and stated some conjectures about them. We prove one of these by giving a sharp lower bound for the height of the points of G\"otzky's domain.</description>

      <title>On the height of some generators of galois extensions with big galois group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the height of generators of Galois extensions of the rationals having the alternating group $\mathfrak{A}_n$ as Galois group. We prove that if such generators are obtained from certain, albeit classical, constructions, their height tends to infinity as $n$ increases. This provides an analogue of a result by Amoroso, originally established for the symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Faulhaber's formula, Bernoulli numbers and the equation $f(x)+x^k=f(x+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern usage the Bernoulli numbers and polynomials follow Euler's approach and are defined using generating functions. We consider the functional equation $f(x)+x^k=f(x+1)$ and show that a solution can be derived from Faulhaber's formula for the sum of powers. We show how these solutions provide a characterization of Bernoulli numbers and related results.</description>

      <title>Uniform Recurrence in the Motzkin Numbers and Related Sequences mod $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many famous integer sequences including the Catalan numbers and the Motzkin numbers can be expressed in the form $ConstantTermOf\left[P(x)^nQ(x)\right]$ for Laurent polynomials $Q$, and symmetric Laurent trinomials $P$. In this paper we characterize the primes for which sequences of this form are uniformly recurrent modulo $p$. For all other primes, we show that $0$ has density $1$. This will be accomplished by showing that the study of these sequences mod $p$ can be reduced to the study of the generalized central trinomial coefficients, which are well-behaved mod $p$.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behavior for partitions separated by parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of partitions with parts separated by parity was initiated by Andrews in connection with Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and his variations on this theme have produced generating functions with a large variety of different modular properties. In this paper, we use Ingham's Tauberian theorem to compute the asymptotic main term for each of the eight functions studied by Andrews.</description>

      <title>Eigenspaces of Newforms with Nontrivial Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07804v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S_{k}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)$ denote the space of holomorphic cuspforms with Dirichlet character $\chi$ and modular subgroup $\Gamma_0(N)$. We will characterize the space of newforms $S_{k}^{new}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)$ as the intersection of eigenspaces of a particular family of Hecke operators, generalizing the work of Baruch-Purkait to forms with non-trivial character. We achieve this by obtaining representation theoretic results in the $p$-adic case which we then de-adelizize into relations of classical operators.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for generalized Hurwitz spaces and Selmer groups in quadratic twist families over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains heuristics for Selmer groups of quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over global function fields. As a consequence, we derive a result towards the "minimalist conjecture" on Selmer ranks of abelian varieties in such families. More precisely, we show that the probabilities predicted in these two conjectures are correct to within an error term in the size of the constant field, $q$, which goes to $0$ as $q$ grows. Two key inputs are a new homological stability theorem for a generalized version of Hurwitz spaces parameterizing covers of punctured Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus, and an expression of average sizes of Selmer groups in terms of the number of rational points on these Hurwitz spaces over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Kida's formula via Selmer complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Iwasawa theory, the $\lambda$, $\mu$-invariants of various arithmetic modules are fundamental invariants that measure the size of the modules. Concerning the minus components of the unramified Iwasawa modules, Kida proved a formula that describes the behavior of those invariants with respect to field extensions. Subsequently, many analogues of Kida's formula have been found in various areas in Iwasawa theory. In this paper, we present a novel approach to such analogues of Kida's formula, based on the perspective of Selmer complexes.</description>

      <title>Badly approximable grids and k-divergent lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an m by n real matrix A, we investigate the set of badly approximable targets for A as a subset of the m-torus. It is well known that this set is large in the sense that it is dense and has full Hausdorff dimension. We investigate the relationship between its measure and Diophantine properties of A. On the one hand, we give the first examples of a non-singular matrix A such that the set of badly approximable targets has full measure with respect to some non-trivial algebraic measure on the torus. For this, we use transference theorems due to Jarnik and Khintchine, and the parametric geometry of numbers in the sense of Roy. On the other hand, we give a novel Diophantine condition on A that slightly strengthens non-singularity, and show that under the assumption that A satisfies this condition, the set of badly approximable targets is a null-set with respect to any non-trivial algebraic measure on the torus. For this we use naive homogeneous dynamics, harmonic analysis, and a novel concept we refer to as mixing convergence of measures.</description>

      <title>Notes on zeta ratio stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This semi-expository note clarifies the extent to which recent ideas in homological stability can resolve the Ratios Conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. For large fixed $q$, a uniform power saving at distance $\ge q^{-\delta}$ from the critical line is possible. This implies cancellation-beyond-GRH in arbitrarily large ranges of moduli relative to the family of $L$-functions. It has applications to the statistics of low-lying zeros.</description>

      <title>Universal Weil cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new Weil cohomology for smooth projective varieties over a field, universal among Weil cohomologies with values in rigid additive tensor categories. A similar universal problem for Weil cohomologies with values in rigid abelian tensor categories also has a solution. We give a variant for Weil cohomologies satisfying more axioms, like Weak and Hard Lefschetz. As a consequence, we get a different construction of Andr\'e's category of motives for motivated correspondences and show that it has a universal property. This theory extends over suitable bases.</description>

      <title>F-characteristic cycle of a rank one sheaf on an arithmetic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rationality of the characteristic form for a degree one character of the Galois group of an abelian extension of henselian discrete valuation fields. We prove the integrality of the characteristic form for a rank one sheaf on a regular excellent scheme. These properties are shown by reducing to the corresponding properties of the refined Swan conductor proved by Kato. We define the F-characteristic cycle of a rank one sheaf on an arithmetic surface as a cycle on the FW-cotangent bundle using the characteristic form on the basis of the computation of the characteristic cycle in the equal characteristic case by Yatagawa. The rationality and the integrality of the characteristic form are necessary for the definition of the F-characteristic cycle. We prove the intersection of the F-characteristic cycle with the 0-section computes the Swan conductor of cohomology of the generic fiber.</description>
