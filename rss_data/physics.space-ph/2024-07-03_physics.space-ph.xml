      <title>Dynamics and solar wind control of the recovery of strong geomagnetic storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the characteristics and dynamical changes during the recovery time of moderate and strong geomagnetic storms (Dst $&lt;-50$ nT). Investigating 57 storms triggered by CMEs/CIRs, we focused on the solar wind's influence on their decay phases. Selected storms were classified into distinct groups based on their recovery characteristics. Using superposed epoch analysis and best fit methods, we scrutinized several interplanetary solar wind plasma and field parameters/functions. The analysis included single, dual, and multiple interplanetary plasma and field parameters/functions. We determined the most representative characteristic time for the storm's recovery profile by fitting an exponential curve. A correlation analysis between Dst and solar wind parameters/functions isolated a coupling function ($\rho^{1/2}$Ey) best describing the decay rate of the ring current. This shows that the electric field term (Ey) coupled with a viscous term ($\rho^{1/2}$) plays a pivotal role in determining the recovery rate of geomagnetic storms. Additionally, we modeled the complex patterns of Dst recovery in relation to solar wind parameters/functions using a second-order polynomial. During the recovery phase, a dynamic correlation between Dst and solar wind parameters/functions was revealed. The three-parameter solar wind-magnetosphere electrodynamical coupling function, combining the viscous term ($\rho^{1/2}$) and the electric field-related function (v$^{4/3}$B) ($\rho^{1/2}$v$^{4/3}$B), significantly impacts the recovery phase of geomagnetic disturbances. Our investigation extended to the relationship between main and recovery phase durations, providing valuable insights into the solar wind's control over the decay of geomagnetic disturbances. These findings advance our comprehension of the complex relationship between solar wind dynamics and the evolution of geomagnetic disturbances.</description>

      <title>Reply to comment on "An Active Plume Eruption on Europa During Galileo Flyby E26 as Indicated by Energetic Proton Depletions"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Huybrighs et al., 2020 we investigated energetic proton depletions along Galileo's Europa flyby E26. Based on a particle tracing analysis we proposed that depletions are caused by perturbed electrogmagnetic fields combined with atmospheric charge exchange and possible plumes. One depletion feature identified as a plume signature was shown to be an artefact Jia et al., 2021. Despite that, here we emphasize that Huybrighs et al., 2020 demonstrates that plumes can cause proton depletions and that these features should be sought after. Furthermore, the conclusions on the importance of perturbed electromagnetic fields and atmospheric charge exchange on the depletions are unaffected. We suggest that the artefact's cause is a mistagging of protons as heavier ions by EPD. The artefact prevents us from confirming or excluding that there is a plume associated depletion. We also address comments on the MHD simulations and demonstrate that 540-1040 keV losses are not necessarily inconsistent with 115-244 keV losses by plume associated charge exchange.</description>

      <title>Observations of Switchback Chains in a Double Solar Proton Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although recent research suggests a link in support of a model of switchback formation in the solar corona via interchange reconnection that is propagated outward with the solar wind and similarities in their ion composition to plasma instability produced plasmoids, these plasma instabilities have yet to be observationally linked to magnetic switchbacks. In this paper we aim to use the theoretical framework of a twin coronal mass ejection event which is known to include interchange reconnection processes and compare this model with experimental observations using Parker Solar Probe FIELDS and $\isis$ instrumentationof an actual event containing two CMEs identified via the associated solar proton event in order to further test and refine the hypothesis of interchange reconnection as a possible physical origin for the magnetic switchback phenomenon. We also intend to introduce a plasma model for the formation of the switchbacks noted within the CME event.</description>

      <title>Energetic Ion Composition as a Means of Investigating the Physical Origins of Alpha Particle Heavy Magnetic Switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic switchbacks are of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the fact that the phenomenon has not been completely understood. Although most of the research into them in the Parker Solar Probe era has largely focused on creating a theoretical framework for causing the field reversal through magnetic interchange reconnection, reconnecting streams of plasma in the solar wind, or shear driven turbulence, it remains unclear to what extent these models may or may not represent the underlying physical reality of magnetic switchbacks. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using statistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying physics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the peak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are indicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated outwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly contradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven interchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the switchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Trigger Mechanism of Explosive Reconnection in Partially Ionized Solar Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability is usually accounted for the onset of fast reconnection events observed in astrophysical plasmas. However, the measured reconnection rate from observations can be one order of magnitude higher than that derived from MHD simulations. In this study, we present the results of magnetic reconnection in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere based on 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. The whole reconnection process covers two different fast reconnection phases. In the first phase, the slow Sweet-Parker reconnection transits to the plasmoid-mediated reconnection, and the reconnection rate reaches about 0.02. In the second phase, a faster explosive reconnection appears, with the reconnection rate reaching above 0.06. At the same time, a sharp decrease in plasma temperature and density at the principle X-point is observed which is associated with the strong radiative cooling, the ejection of hot plasma from the local reconnection region or the motion of principle X-point from hot and denser region to cool and less dense one along the narrow current sheet. This causes gas pressure depletion and the increasing of magnetic diffusion at the main X-point, resulting in the local Petschek-like reconnection and a violent and rapid increase in the reconnection rate. This study for the first time reveals a common phenomenon that the plasmoid dominated reconnection transits to an explosive faster reconnection with the rate approaching the order of 0.1 in partially ionized plasma in the MHD scale.</description>

      <title>Energetic proton losses reveal Io's extended and longitudinally asymmetrical atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along the I24, I27 and I31 flybys of Io (1999-2001), the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) onboard the Galileo spacecraft observed localised regions of energetic protons losses (155 keV-1250 keV). Using back-tracking particle simulations combined with a prescribed atmospheric distribution and a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of the plasma/atmosphere interaction, we investigate the possible causes of these depletions. We focus on a limited region within two Io radii, which is dominated by Io's SO$_2$ atmosphere. Our results show that charge exchange of protons with the SO$_2$ atmosphere, absorption by the surface and the configuration of the electromagnetic field contribute to the observed proton depletion along the Galileo flybys. In the 155-240 keV energy range, charge exchange is either a major or the dominant loss process, depending on the flyby altitude. In the 540-1250 keV range, as the charge exchange cross sections are small, the observed decrease of the proton flux is attributed to absorption by the surface and the perturbed electromagnetic fields, which divert the protons away from the detector. From a comparison between the modelled losses and the data we find indications of an extended atmosphere on the day/downstream side of Io, a lack of atmospheric collapse on the night/upstream side as well as a more global extended atmospheric component ($&gt; 1$ Io radius). Our results demonstrate that observations and modeling of proton depletion around the moon constitute an important tool to constrain the electromagnetic field configuration around Io and the radial and longitudinal atmospheric distribution, which is still poorly understood.</description>

      <title>Probing Velocity Dispersion inside CMEs in Inner Corona: New Insights on CME Initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the kinematics of the leading edge and the core of 6 Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) in the combined field of view of Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and Image Processing (SWAP) on-board PRoject for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA-2) and the ground-based K-Cor coronagraph of the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO). We report, for the first time, on the existence of a critical height h$_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of velocity dispersion inside the CME. This height for the studied events lies between 1.4-1.8 R$_{\odot}$, in the inner corona. We find the critical heights to be relatively higher for gradual CMEs, as compared to impulsive ones, indicating that the early initiation of these two classes might be different physically. We find several interesting imprints of the velocity dispersion on CME kinematics. The critical height is strongly correlated with the flux-rope minor radius and the mass of the CME. Also, the magnitude of velocity dispersion shows a reasonable positive correlation with the above two parameters. We believe these results will advance our understanding of CME initiation mechanisms and will help provide improved constraints to CME initiation models.</description>
