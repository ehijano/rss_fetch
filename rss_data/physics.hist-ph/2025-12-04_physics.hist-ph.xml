      <title>Determining the Qibla Direction by Astronomical and Geometrical Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the determination of the Qibla direction using both astronomical and geometrical approaches. The study reviews historical and classical methods employed by Muslim scholars and astronomers including the use of instruments such as the astrolabe and compass. It further explores spherical trigonometry techniques to precisely calculate the Qibla azimuth from any given location on Earth. The research clarifies geometric constructions and presents a computational model implemented in C++ to facilitate accurate Qibla determination. This interdisciplinary analysis underscores the rich tradition of Islamic astronomy and geometry in solving practical religious requirements, providing both theoretical frameworks and practical algorithms for modern application.</description>

      <title>Comparing land- and skyscapes in the three main manorial-conquered lands of the Canary Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a study of the relationship between astronomy and landscape focused on the orientation of Christian churches of the three main Manorial (Se\~nor\'io) Islands of the Canary archipelago (Spain): Lanzarote, La Gomera and Fuerteventura. As a background, we have the information provided by the texts of early Christian writers, which imposed that churches should be oriented towards the east [..]. The fieldwork that supports our comparative study is based on the measurement of the precise location coordinates, axis' azimuth and angular height of the horizon for most of the churches of the three islands, which amounts to about 120 sets of measurements. For the study of the sample, we have employed various analyses, both statistical, as well as calendric and orographic. Our results show that on all the islands, the pattern of double orientations is repeated, which contemplates the canonical tradition of orienting the altars of churches within the solar range (pointing either eastward or westward). Very few cases also occur where it is possible to identify constructions whose orientation follows solstitial patterns, perhaps as imitation of aboriginal worship. But this double pattern also includes a high proportion of churches with orientations far from this range. An example is Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, both islands subjected to the same flow of the prevailing trade winds in the region, but each with its own characteristics. Another example is given by the particular orography of deep ravines of La Gomera, which determines the orientation of the temples located in those geographical accidents. In this paper we show how the combination of elements of the land- and skyscape can, with a high degree of probability, offer a satisfactory explanation to the particular orientation of these insular centres of worship, which were built during the first decades after the European conquest.</description>

      <title>Post-Cold War Diaspora of Russian Particle Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the migration of scientists from the Soviet Union to the West occurred at a modest pace during the 1970s and 1980s, the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 and the ensuing economic and social hardships precipitated a massive exodus that amounted to a true brain drain. The international physics community, particularly in Europe and the United States, absorbed a substantial influx of specialists in nuclear, high-energy, and accelerator physics, including both seasoned scientists and engineers as well as promising graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Many of these emigre researchers went on to assume leadership positions, drive major experimental and theoretical initiatives, and achieve scientific distinction that equaled or even surpassed their accomplishments at home. In this article we explore the defining features of this post Cold War scientific diaspora, assess its impact on Russia research infrastructure and capabilities, and evaluate its enduring contributions to global particle physics collaborations and discoveries.</description>
