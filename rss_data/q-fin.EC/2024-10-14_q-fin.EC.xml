      <title>Underutilized land and sustainable development: effects on employment, economic output, and mitigation of CO2 emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss are calling for innovative approaches to effective reforestation and afforestation. This paper explores the integration of artificial intelligence and remote sensing technologies for optimizing tree planting strategies, estimating labor requirements, and determining space needs for various tree species in Gabala District of Azerbaijan. The study employs YOLOv8 for precise identification of potential planting sites and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach, combined with the Gemini API, to provide tailored species recommendations. The methodology incorporates time-series modeling to forecast the impact of reforestation on CO2 emissions reduction, utilizing Holt-Winters for predictions. Our results indicate that the AI model can effectively identify suitable locations and species, offering valuable insights into the potential economic and environmental benefits of large-scale tree planting thus fostering sustainable economic development and helping to mitigate the adverse effects of global warming and climate change.</description>

      <title>Transaction Execution Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies transaction execution mechanisms (TEMs) for blockchains as the efficient resource allocation across multiple parallel execution queues or "local fee markets." We present a model considering capacity constraints, user valuations, and delay costs in a multi-queue system with an aggregate capacity constraint due to global consensus. We show that revenue maximization tends to allocate capacity to the highest-paying queue, while welfare maximization generally serves all queues. Optimal relative pricing of different queues depends on factors such as market size, demand elasticity, and the balance between local and global congestion. Our results have implications for evolving blockchain architectures, including parallel execution, DAG-based systems, and multiple concurrent proposers, and can help design more efficient TEMs.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Remittance Inflows- International Reserves-External Debt Dyad: Exploring Bangladesh's Economic Resilience in Avoiding Sovereign Default Compared to Sri Lanka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External debt has been identified as the most liable to cause financial crises in developing countries in Asia and Latin America. One recent example of near bankruptcy in Sri Lanka has raised serious concerns among economists about how to anticipate and tackle external debt-related problems. Bangladesh also faced a decline in export income and a sharp rise in import prices amid the aforementioned global shocks. Nevertheless, the international reserves of Bangladesh have never fallen to the level they did in Sri Lanka. This paper examines the relationship between remittance inflows, international reserves, and external debt in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Econometric estimations reveal that remittance affects external debt both directly and through international reserves in Bangladesh. The existence of a Dutch Disease effect in the remittance inflows-international reserves relationship has also been confirmed in Bangladesh. We also show that Bangladesh uses international reserves as collateral to obtain more external borrowing, while Sri Lanka, like many other developing countries, accumulates international reserves to deplete in "bad times." Remittances can be seen as one of the significant factors preventing Bangladesh from becoming a sovereign defaulter, whereas Sri Lanka faced that fate.</description>

      <title>Supply Chain Optimization Strategies: An Empirical Study on Fresh Product Delivery Routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with rising consumer demand, fresh products have gained increasing attention, leading to rapid growth in the fresh food market. However, due to their perishable nature and sensitivity to storage conditions, fresh products are vulnerable to damage during transportation. Improper handling, excessive transit times, and physical impacts can result in significant losses. As a result, enhancing the efficiency of fresh product distribution while maintaining quality has become critical to the further development of the fresh food industry. Using Y chain supermarket as a case study, this paper investigates the logistics of fresh product distribution, identifying current challenges and inefficiencies. Through literature review, expert interviews, and comparative analysis, the study offers strategic recommendations for optimizing fresh product delivery routes to improve distribution efficiency and product quality.</description>

      <title>Double Jeopardy and Climate Impact in the Use of Large Language Models: Socio-economic Disparities and Reduced Utility for Non-English Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), holds the potential to bridge language and information gaps, which can benefit the economies of developing nations. However, our analysis of FLORES-200, FLORES+, Ethnologue, and World Development Indicators data reveals that these benefits largely favor English speakers. Speakers of languages in low-income and lower-middle-income countries face higher costs when using OpenAI's GPT models via APIs because of how the system processes the input -- tokenization. Around 1.5 billion people, speaking languages primarily from lower-middle-income countries, could incur costs that are 4 to 6 times higher than those faced by English speakers. Disparities in LLM performance are significant, and tokenization in models priced per token amplifies inequalities in access, cost, and utility. Moreover, using the quality of translation tasks as a proxy measure, we show that LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages, presenting a ``double jeopardy" of higher costs and poor performance for these users. We also discuss the direct impact of fragmentation in tokenizing low-resource languages on climate. This underscores the need for fairer algorithm development to benefit all linguistic groups.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Link and Flow Prediction in Bank Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction of both the existence and weight of network links at future time points is essential as complex networks evolve over time. Traditional methods, such as vector autoregression and factor models, have been applied to small, dense networks, but become computationally impractical for large-scale, sparse, and complex networks. Some machine learning models address dynamic link prediction, but few address the simultaneous prediction of both link presence and weight. Therefore, we introduce a novel model that dynamically predicts link presence and weight by dividing the task into two sub-tasks: predicting remittance ratios and forecasting the total remittance volume. We use a self-attention mechanism that combines temporal-topological neighborhood features to predict remittance ratios and use a separate model to forecast the total remittance volume. We achieve the final prediction by multiplying the outputs of these models. We validated our approach using two real-world datasets: a cryptocurrency network and bank transfer network.</description>

      <title>Does AI help humans make better decisions? A statistical evaluation framework for experimental and observational studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more generally data-driven algorithms, has become ubiquitous in today's society. Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions compared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a new methodological framework to empirically answer this question with a minimal set of assumptions. We measure a decision maker's ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded and unconfounded treatment assignment, where the provision of AI-generated recommendations is assumed to be randomized across cases with humans making final decisions. Under this study design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems--human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. Importantly, the AI-alone system includes any individualized treatment assignment, including those that are not used in the original study. We also show when AI recommendations should be provided to a human-decision maker, and when one should follow such recommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to our own randomized controlled trial evaluating a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that the risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge's decision to impose cash bail. Furthermore, we find that replacing a human judge with algorithms--the risk assessment score and a large language model in particular--leads to a worse classification performance.</description>

      <title>Tax Credits and Household Behavior: The Roles of Myopic Decision-Making and Liquidity in a Simulated Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in multi-agent simulators in the domain of economic modeling. However, contemporary research often involves developing reinforcement learning (RL) based models that focus solely on a single type of agents, such as households, firms, or the government. Such an approach overlooks the adaptation of interacting agents thereby failing to capture the complexity of real-world economic systems. In this work, we consider a multi-agent simulator comprised of RL agents of numerous types, including heterogeneous households, firm, central bank and government. In particular, we focus on the crucial role of the government in distributing tax credits to households. We conduct two broad categories of comprehensive experiments dealing with the impact of tax credits on 1) households with varied degrees of myopia (short-sightedness in spending and saving decisions), and 2) households with diverse liquidity profiles. The first category of experiments examines the impact of the frequency of tax credits (e.g. annual vs quarterly) on consumption patterns of myopic households. The second category of experiments focuses on the impact of varying tax credit distribution strategies on households with differing liquidities. We validate our simulation model by reproducing trends observed in real households upon receipt of unforeseen, uniform tax credits, as documented in a JPMorgan Chase report. Based on the results of the latter, we propose an innovative tax credit distribution strategy for the government to reduce inequality among households. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy in improving social welfare in our simulation results.</description>
