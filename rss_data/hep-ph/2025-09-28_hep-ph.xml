      <title>Enhanced Axion-Photon Conversion via Seeded Photons instead of Resonant Cavities for Short-Pulse Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a seeded axion-photon conversion scheme to enhance the sensitivity of light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments for axion detection, where the axions are generated from short pulse lasers and the usual resonant cavity is not applicable. By injecting a small, coherent seed electromagnetic field (EM field) into the axion-photon conversion region, the axion-induced EM field can constructively interfere with the seed field, amplifying the regenerated photon number beyond the unseeded case. Starting from the axion-modified Maxwell equations, we derive the axion-photon conversion probability and show how an initial seed field boosts the final photon amplitude. The relative phase between the seed field and the axion field can cause constructive or destructive interference, though the measurable quantity is the net photon number variation. We evaluate the expected signal enhancement, signal-to-noise considerations (including seed shot noise), and the potential improvement in coupling sensitivity. Compared to a standard LSW setup, the seeded scheme can achieve orders-of-magnitude higher photon yield per axion, potentially surpassing resonance-enhanced experiments in certain parameter regimes. This approach offers a promising route to extend the reach of laboratory axion searches, especially for the case where the resonant cavities are impractical.</description>

      <title>Foundation models for high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of foundation models -- large, pretrained machine learning models that can be finetuned to a variety of tasks -- has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. In high-energy physics, the question of whether these models can be implemented directly in physics research, or even built from scratch, tailored for particle physics data, has generated an increasing amount of attention. This review, which is the first on the topic of foundation models in high-energy physics, summarizes and discusses the research that has been published in the field so far.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory in Long-Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of physics beyond the Standard Model in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments using the most general parametrisation of heavy new physics in the framework of Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT), as well as its counterpart below the electroweak scale, Weak Effective Field Theory (WEFT). We compute neutrino production, oscillation, and detection rates in these frameworks, consistently accounting for renormalisation group running as well as SMEFT/WEFT matching. We moreover use appropriately modified neutrino--nucleus cross sections, focusing specifically on the regime of quasi-elastic scattering. Compared to the traditional formalism of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI), our approach is theoretically more consistent, and it allows for straightforward joint analyses of data taken at different energy scales and by different experiments including not only neutrino oscillation experiments, but also searches for charged lepton flavour violation, low-energy precision measurements, and the LHC. As a specific example, we carry out a sensitivity study for the DUNE experiment and compute projected limits on the WEFT and SMEFT Wilson coefficients. Together with this paper, we also release a public simulation package called ``GLoBES-EFT'' for consistently simulating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments in the presence of new physics parameterized either in WEFT or in SMEFT. GLoBES-EFT is available from \href{https://github.com/SalvaUrrea2/GLoBES-EFT}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Event Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo event generators are in a modern terminology the digital twins of collider-based particle physics experiment. We give an introduction into the application of MC generators for particle physics, discuss their different components each simmulating a different aspect of physics. The main part is the hard scattering process, sampled over a commplicated phase space of kinematic variables, followed by simulation of strong and electromagnetic radiation in parton showers, and hadronization of the end products of the shower into mesons and baryons. These then undergo several levels of decays into those particles that are measured in the detectors - mostly electrons, photons, pions and kaons. For each step, the main techniques will be described and explained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proceedings contribution discusses Lorentz and CPT violation in the context of charged-lepton flavor-changing processes. Particular emphasis is placed on coherent muon-to-electron conversion in muonic atoms. Data collected by the SINDRUM~II experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute is used to extract constraints on mass dimension $d=5$ electromagnetic and $d=6$ quark-lepton effects. The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab and COMET experiment at the Japan Proton Accelerator Complex are projected to improve constraints by up to two orders in magnitude.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Reduction of Multi-loop Feynman Integrals via Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, systematic method for the complete symbolic reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals, leveraging the power of generating functions. The differential equations governing these generating functions naturally yield symbolic recurrence relations. We develop an efficient algorithm that utilizes these recurrences to reduce integrals to a minimal set of master integrals. This approach circumvents the exponential growth of traditional Integration-by-Parts relations, enabling the reduction of high-rank, multi-loop integrals critical for state-of-the-art calculations in perturbative quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Study of $B_{c} \to J/\psi (a_1(1260), b_1(1235),a_2(1320), K_2^*(1430))$ in the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by systematic observations of $B_c$ decays at LHCb, we analyze $B_c^+ \to J/\psi (A, T)$ decays (where $A$ denotes axial-vector mesons $a_1(1260)^+, b_1(1235)^+$, and $T$ denotes tensor mesons $a_2(1320)^+, K_2^*(1430)^+$) within the perturbative QCD (pQCD) factorization framework. Nonperturbative dynamics are regulated by light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), with endpoint divergences controlled via Sudakov suppression. Predictions yield branching ratios ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ for $B_c^{+} \to J/\psi A$ and at the level of $10^{-6}$ for $B_c^{+} \to J/\psi T$, which seem to be in the reach of future experiments. We also provide predictions for the polarization fractions of $B_c^+ \to J/\psi (A, T)$, according to quark helicity analysis, the longitudinal polarization amplitudes are expected to dominate the branching ratios.</description>

      <title>No room for monopole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic monopole of a dark sector has been advocated as an appealing dark matter candidate. We revisit the computation of the monopole abundance $\Omega_M$, generated by a thermal phase transition in the minimal 't Hooft-Polyakov model. We explore the three regimes where the phase transition is second order, weakly first order, or supercooled, identifying the parameter space regions where $\Omega_M$ can match the observed dark matter abundance. However, the dark sector necessarily contains a stable electrically-charged particle, namely a massive vector boson, with a calculable abundance $\Omega_{W'}$. We show that, under minimal assumptions, $\Omega_{W'}$ is always far larger than $\Omega_M$: dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Impact of inelastic corrections on $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ scattering from UPC at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current theoretical estimations lead to cross-sections for $AA \to \gamma \gamma AA$ which are somewhat smaller than the measured ones by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, In our recent paper, we estimated the contribution of inelastic channels to the Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering in ultraperipheral collisions (UPC) of heavy ions, in which one or both of the incident nuclei dissociate ($A A \to \gamma \gamma X Y$ where $X, Y = A, A'$) due to the photon emission. These new mechanisms are related to extra emissions that are difficult to identify and may be misinterpreted as enhanced $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ scattering. We include processes of coupling of photons to individual nucleons in addition to coherent coupling to the whole nuclei. Both elastic (nucleon in the ground state) and inelastic (nucleon in an excited state) are taken into account. The inelastic nucleon fluxes are calculated using CTEQ18QED photon distribution in nucleon. The inelastic photon fluxes are shown and compared to standard photon fluxes in the nucleus. We present the ratio of the inelastic corrections to the standard contribution to the nuclear cross section. We find that for the ATLAS kinematics the inelastic corrections grow with $M_{\gamma \gamma}$ and rapidity difference. Our results indicate that the inelastic contributions can be of the order of 20-40 \% of the traditional (no nuclear excitation) predictions. We discuss also uncertainties due to the choice of factorization scale.</description>

      <title>Dynamical gluon effects in the three-dimensional structure of pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the pion, including the contributions from one dynamical gluon, using the basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) approach. By solving a light-front QCD Hamiltonian with a three-dimensional confining potential, we obtain the light-front wavefunctions (LFWFs) for both the quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sectors. These wavefunctions are then employed to compute the unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of valence quarks and gluons. We also extract the transverse spatial distributions, providing the squared radii of quark and gluon densities in the impact-parameter space. This work contributes toward a three-dimensional understanding of the pion's internal structure in both momentum and coordinate space.</description>

      <title>Committing to Bubbles: Finding the Critical Configuration on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleation of bubbles in first-order phase transitions is traditionally characterised by the critical bubble: defined as the saddle-point solution of the Euclidean action that separates collapsing from expanding field configurations. While this picture is exact in the noiseless, zero-temperature limit, thermal fluctuations introduces stochasticity which can influence the behaviour of the field configuration. In this work, we develop a purely statistical criterion for identifying the critical bubble by leveraging the concept of the ``committor'' probability: the likelihood that a given local field configuration evolves to the true vacuum before returning to the false vacuum. Using ensembles of lattice simulations with controlled thermal noise, we extract the committor probability during the evolution of a bubble from sub- to super-criticality. We find this approach to be robust, accounts for finite-temperature effects, and allows independent verification of bounce-based predictions. To demonstrate this, we compare the average profile obtained via the committor probability method to standard theory for a given model and find strong agreement, particularly at the core of the bubble. Importantly, we also observe that the behaviour of the committor probability with time is smooth and well defined. This method establishes a robust, simulation-driven framework for studying nucleation dynamics in thermal field theories and may be especially applicable in cases where analytical control might be limited.</description>

      <title>Stable and Interpretable Jet Physics with IRC-Safe Equivariant Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in jet classification tasks, yet a key challenge remains: understanding what these models learn and how their features relate to known QCD observables. Improving interpretability is essential for building robust and trustworthy machine learning tools in collider physics. To address this challenge, we investigate graph neural networks for quark-gluon discrimination, systematically incorporating physics-motivated inductive biases. In particular, we design message-passing architectures that enforce infrared and collinear (IRC) safety, as well as E(2) and O(2) equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane. Using simulated jet datasets, we compare these networks against unconstrained baselines in terms of classification performance, robustness to soft emissions, and latent representation structures. Our analysis shows that physics-aware networks are more stable across training instances and distribute their latent variance across multiple interpretable directions. By regressing Energy Flow Polynomials onto the leading principal components, we establish a direct correspondence between learned representations and established IRC-safe jet observables. These results demonstrate that embedding symmetry and safety constraints not only improves robustness but also grounds network representations in known QCD structures, providing a principled approach toward interpretable deep learning in collider physics.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD Prediction of the Hyperon EDM from CP-violating Dipole Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) of baryons provides a sensitive probe of CP-violating interactions beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by the recent BESIII measurement on the $\Lambda$-hyperon EDM [1], we present the first perturbative QCD analysis of the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to elucidate its origin in CP-violating quark dipole interactions. In particular, we derive a QCD factorization formula that relates the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to quark EDMs and chromo-electric dipole moments (CEDMs) through convolutions with the light-cone distribution amplitudes of $\Lambda$. These connections allow us to extract constraints on CP-violating dipole couplings from current and future hyperon EDM measurements. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the $\Lambda$ EDM exhibits unique sensitivity to the strange-quark CEDM, providing complementary information to that obtained from the neutron EDM.</description>

      <title>Non-Holomorphic $A_4$ Modular Symmetry in Type-I Seesaw: Implications for Neutrino Masses and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos, governed by a non-holomorphic $A_{4}$ modular flavor symmetry. Within this model framework, the light neutrino masses are generated via the popular type-I seesaw mechanism in which the structure of the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings is decided by nonholomorphic modular forms. Unlike conventional flavor models with ad hoc flavon fields, the structure of Dirac and Majorana mass matrices is entirely determined by a modulus parameter $\tau$. We construct the predictive mass matrices for charged leptons, Dirac neutrinos, and right-handed Majorana neutrinos and show the compatibility with neutrino oscillation data by an appropriate choice of input model parameters. We find that our $\chi^2$ analysis of neutrino masses and mixing gives excellent agreement with current neutrino oscillation observables by taking normal hierarchical pattern of light neutrinos. We present numerical analysis of two sets of benchmark points explaining neutrino masses while generating the correct amount of baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. We estimate numerically the values of CP-asymmetry and examine the evolution of the lepton asymmetry by studying Boltzman equations by considering both strong and washout regimes with CP-asymmetry parameter in the range $|\varepsilon_{1}| \sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-8}$. The model predicts an effective Majorana mass in the few meV range, below current experimental bounds but within reach of next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. The key feature of non-holomorphic $A_4$ modular symmetry naturally accommodates non-zero neutrino masses and mixings, minimizes the Yukawa arbitrariness, and establishes a direct connection between high-scale leptogenesis with low-energy neutrino observable parameters, thereby the model provides a testable link between neutrino flavor physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>When backgrounds become signals: neutrino interactions in xenon-based dark matter detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection dark matter experiments have proven to be compelling probes for studying low-energy neutrino interactions with both nuclei and atomic electrons, offering complementary information to accelerator and reactor-based neutrino experiments. Recently, the XENONnT and PandaX-4T collaborations reported the first evidence of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8\mathrm{B}$ solar neutrinos. Thanks to their excellent background rejection capabilities and distinctive signal signatures, dual-phase time projection chambers are also sensitive to $pp$ solar neutrinos via their elastic scattering off atomic electrons in the target material. Although this signal is subdominant within the Standard Model, it becomes significantly enhanced in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, offering a unique opportunity to probe new physics in the low-energy regime. While the precision of current neutrino measurements from dark matter detectors remains lower than that achieved by dedicated neutrino experiments, their sensitivity to the tau neutrino component of solar neutrinos helps complete the overall picture, especially when investigating flavor-dependent new physics effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This competition in high-energy physics (HEP) and machine learning was the first to strongly emphasise uncertainties in $(H \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^-)$ cross-section measurement. Participants were tasked with developing advanced analysis techniques capable of dealing with uncertainties in the input training data and providing credible confidence intervals. The accuracy of these intervals was evaluated using pseudo-experiments to assess correct coverage. The dataset is now published in Zenodo, and the winning submissions are fully documented.</description>

      <title>EFT of Non-Markovian $U(1)_X$ Breaking: Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective field theory (EFT) framework for $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry breaking in which the dynamics of the order parameter acquire non-local-in-time (``memory'') corrections from a heavy dark sector. Integrating out metastable or slowly equilibrating fields generates temporal kernels in the EFT, yielding a history-dependent effective potential for the $U(1)_X$ scalar. These non-Markovian terms qualitatively alter first-order phase transition dynamics by modifying bubble nucleation, latent heat release, and wall propagation. The resulting stochastic gravitational-wave spectrum exhibits distinctive features such as broadened peaks, asymmetric slopes, and possible secondary ``echoes'' that are absent in conventional Markovian treatments. When the memory-generating sector also participates in dark matter production, the same kernel parameters correlate gravitational-wave signatures with the relic abundance. This work establishes the EFT formalism for non-equilibrium symmetry breaking and highlights testable predictions for upcoming GW observatories and DM searches.</description>

      <title>Recent progress in modeling neutrino-nucleus interactions for oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of accelerator-based neutrino experiments crucially depends on the good control of nuclear effects in the neutrino interactions with the detectors. Recently the focus of both experimental measurements and theoretical studies has moved from the inclusive channel, where only the final lepton is detected, to the more challenging semi-inclusive reactions, where one or more hadrons are detected in coincidence with the lepton. In this contribution we present our recent research of the semi-inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu p)$ reaction on carbon for the quasielastic and the two-particle-two-hole channels. We show some representative results and their comparison with experimental data, illustrating the robustness of the theoretical approach and discussing possible improvements to the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of linear Paul traps as quantum sensors for detecting megahertz gravitational waves. Single-ion configurations exploit graviton-photon conversion in the presence of external magnetic fields, while two-ion systems use relative-motion excitations, which do not require magnets, to distinguish gravitational waves from axion dark matter. Furthermore, we show that entanglement of $N$ vibrational qubits enhances the signal probability by a factor of $N^2$, improving sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Event Generator Tuning as a Robustness Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments use Monte Carlo event generators to predict neutrino-nucleus interactions. Cross section uncertainties are typically implemented by varying the parameters of the model(s) used in the generator. We study the performance of two commonly-used model configurations of the GENIE generator (G18_10a_02_11a and AR23_0i_00_000) and their uncertainties by tuning parameters to cross section data, and then comparing the resulting tuned prediction to a suite of other measurements from T2K, MicroBooNE, and MINERvA. This reveals whether the model can simultaneously describe several datasets, as well as whether the uncertainties are adequately robust. We find that G18 and especially AR23 are reasonable in predicting lower-energy measurements from T2K and MicroBooNE, but unable to describe MINERvA data, and discuss the implications for short-baseline oscillation searches. We attempt to replicate a tuning procedure developed by MicroBooNE using several different measurements, and find substantially different results depending on which measurement is used, and that the MicroBooNE tune does not agree with other measurements. We conclude that the SBN experiment should not tune its generator to external data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of neutrinos in a fluctuating classical axion-like particles (ALPs) field is investigated. The equation for the neutrino density matrix is obtained in the Redfield form, and the corresponding dissipative matrix is derived. Estimates on the correlation time of the ALPs field fluctuations and on the ALP-neutrino coupling constants are obtained using the limits on the decoherence parameter determined from the analysis of reactor neutrino experiments data.</description>

      <title>Multi-parton contributions to $\bar B \to X_s \gamma$ at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many contributions to the decay rate of the inclusive radiative $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s \gamma$ transition have been calculated to NNLO in QCD during the past decades. However, there are still a few unknown contributions from multi-parton final states which are formally NLO. In the present work, we compute those four-body $b \rightarrow s\, q\, \bar{q}\,\gamma$ contributions at NLO in QCD which need to be supplemented by the five-body $b \rightarrow s\, q\, \bar{q}\, g\,\gamma $ bremsstrahlung. This calculation formally completes the purely perturbative contributions to $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s \gamma$ at NLO. Our results are obtained by applying modern techniques of integral reduction and evaluation of master integrals. In particular, the analytic integration over the four and five-particle phase space in the presence of a cut on the photon energy turns out to be technically involved. We give our results completely analytically in terms of multiple polylogarithms, including the dependence on the collinear logarithms which arise from the mass-regularisation of collinear divergences. The numerical impact of multi-parton corrections on the $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s \gamma$ decay rate turns out to be small, owing to a partial cancellation between LO and NLO contributions.</description>

      <title>Advanced stereoscopy applied to CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international observatory currently under construction, which will consist of two sites (one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere). It will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. In the meantime, a small subarray composed of four Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) at the Northern site will begin collecting data in the coming year. In preparation, we present a stereoscopic event reconstruction using graph neural networks (GNNs) to combine information from several telescopes of this subarray. In our previous work, we explored the use of GNNs for the stereoscopic reconstruction of gamma-ray events on simulated data from the Prod5 sample and showed that GNNs provide a better stereoscopic reconstruction. We now compare this approach to the currently foreseen method that analytically combines the output of monoscopic random forests, and explore how GNNs can be used in fusion with the Random forest algorithm in order to provide a more sensitive stereoscopic system.</description>

      <title>Buchdahl limit of compact stars in presence of Weyl anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We setup an anisotropic compact star model in presence of Weyl ``trace" anomaly. We derive an exact interior solution which determines the contribution of the vacuum trace anomaly. We introduce a dimentionless parameter, $\beta$, to characterize this contribution. Applying appropriate matching conditions with the exterior solution, we determine the model parameters in terms of the Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$ and the compactness parameter, $C=\frac{2GM}{c^2 \mathcal{R}}$ where $M$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are the mass and the radius of the star. We investigate the parameter space $\{\beta, C\}$ and the corresponding modifications of Buchdahl limit on the maximum compactness. We use astrophysical observations of mass and radius of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 to constrain the Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$. Also, we investigate the Mass-Radius diagram with other observational constraints from NICER and LIGO/Virgo collaboration.</description>

      <title>Weakly model-independent determination of total expansion during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study systematically the total expansion experienced by a certain perturbation mode during single-field inflation, not resorting to explicit models of inflation or reheating. By assuming that during the reheating stage the equation of state w{rh} can be written as a function of e-folds, the unknown dynamics during reheating parametrized by w{rh} is confined within a time integral so that any dependence on the models of inflation and reheating is isolated from model-independent contributions. Especially, the dependence on the reheating dynamics via w{rh} and the reheating temperature T{rh} is dominating. We give two illustrative examples of w{rh} to discuss its impacts on the total expansion, which can be different as much as 10 even for the same reheating temperature, depending on the shape of w{rh}.</description>

      <title>Stairway to Axions: the cross-correlation of birefringence and galaxies from NPIPE and Quaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the cross-correlation between anisotropic birefringence and galaxy number counts, utilizing polarization data from Planck NPIPE and the Quaia quasar catalog. By employing a QML/pseudo-$C_\ell$ combined estimator, we compute the angular power spectrum up to $\ell=191$ from birefringence and clustering maps at $N_{\rm side}=64$. Our analysis indicates that the observed spectrum is well consistent with the null-hypothesis, with a probability to exceed of 37% and an estimated scale-invariant amplitude of $A^{\mathcal{D}_\ell}=(2.22\pm2.09)\times10^{-4}\,\text{deg}$, at the 68% confidence level. Finally, we derive constraints on the axion-parameters within an early dark energy model of birefringence. Our findings reveal an unprecedented upper bound on the axion-photon coupling down to $g_{\phi\gamma}=10^{-15}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for masses around $10^{-32}\,\text{eV}$ and high initial misalignment angles. This result opens a previously unexplored window in parameter space, providing the first constraint in this ultra-light mass regime.</description>

      <title>AGN spectral variability across activity states and searches for axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields.
  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity.
  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Cumulative proton production in $pd$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of backward proton production in the exclusive reaction $pd \to ppn$ at proton beam momenta up to several GeV/c is constructed on the basis of Feynman diagrams for one- and two-step amplitudes. The latter include nucleon and $\Delta(1232)$ resonance intermediate scattering states with propagators reduced to eikonal form using the generalized eikonal approximation. The model calculations are compared with available experimental data on the energy spectra of protons at backward polar angles in the deuteron rest frame. It is shown that inclusion of two-step amplitudes significantly increases the production of backward protons with energies above $\sim$ 50 MeV, thereby significantly improving the agreement with experiment. The remaining theoretical problem related to the description of the off-shell behavior of the elementary amplitudes of the $NN \to NN$ and $NN \leftrightarrow N\Delta$ transitions is discussed. Partial discrepancies between different sets of experimental data do not allow us to conclude that exotic effects, such as proton interactions with density fluctuations and/or $6q$ clusters in the deuteron, are present.</description>

      <title>Swift Memory Burden in Merging Black Holes: how information load affects black hole's classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the information load carried by a black hole affects its classical perturbations. We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift memory burden effect" and show that it is universal for objects of high efficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We also provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a table-top laboratory setting with cold bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for dark matter has been ongoing for decades within both astrophysics and particle physics. Both fields have employed different approaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties of dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an astronomer's perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of dark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to astrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community in constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to foster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially important in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned with detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence lies solely within astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we present a short review of the progress made by the Dark Matter Test Science Project and their applications to existing experiments, with a view towards how this project can foster complementary with astrophysical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note the finite formulation of quantum field theory, which is based on the system of the differential equations which are reminiscent of Callan-Symanzik equations is discussed. This system of equations was previously formulated on the bare language. We rederive these equations on a fully renormalized language. In this language, it was demonstrated for a simple $\phi^4$ toy model, that with the specific choice of renormalization conditions - on-shell scheme for renormalized mass - the class of such finite renormalization prescriptions is equivalent to the classical renormalization group equation written in Callan-Symanzik-Ovsyannikov form.</description>

      <title>Constraining the pseudo-Dirac nature of neutrinos using astrophysical neutrino flavor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three Standard Model neutrinos can have Majorana mass or strictly Dirac mass, but both scenarios are practically indistinguishable in neutrino oscillation experiments. If they are pseudo-Dirac, however, there will be new mass splittings among the pseudo-Dirac pairs, potentially leaving traces in neutrino oscillation phenomena. In this work, we use flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrinos to discriminate different possible mass spectra of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. We show that it will be possible to impose robust bounds of order $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-12}$ $\text{eV}^2$ on the new mass squared splitting involving the third pseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates (those with the least electron flavor composition) with the future experiment IceCube-Gen2. The derived sensitivity is robust because it only assumes an extragalactic origin for the astrophysical neutrinos and hierarchical pseudo-Dirac mass spectrum. In case the neutrino sources are known in the future, such bounds can potentially improve by up to five orders of magnitude, reaching $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-17}$ $\text{eV}^2$.</description>

      <title>The nature of $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two decades ago the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ was discovered in the hadron spectrum with two heavy quarks. The discovery fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of so called XYZ exotics states lying outside the conventional quark model, as well as theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, with the potential of disclosing new information about the fundamental strong force. Among the XYZs, the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ stand out for their striking characteristics and unlashed many discussions about their nature. Here, we address this question using the Born--Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory (BOEFT) and show how QCD settles the issue of their composition. Not only we describe well the main features of the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ but obtain also predictions in the bottomonium sector. This opens the way to systematic applications of BOEFT to all XYZs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks for LHC physics have to be accurate, reliable, and controlled. Using neural surrogates for the prediction of loop amplitudes as a use case, we first show how activation functions are systematically tested with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Then, we train neural surrogates to simultaneously predict the target amplitude and an uncertainty for the prediction. We disentangle systematic uncertainties, learned by a well-defined likelihood loss, from statistical uncertainties, which require the introduction of Bayesian neural networks or repulsive ensembles. We test the coverage of the learned uncertainties using pull distributions to quantify the calibration of cutting-edge neural surrogates.</description>

      <title>Final-state rescattering mechanism in bottom-baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays was recently reported by the LHCb collaboration in $\Lambda_b^0\to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$ with $A_{CP} = (2.45 \pm 0.46 \pm 0.10)\%$, which inspires the study on baryon non-leptonic decays. In this work, we perform the first calculation of five exclusive non-leptonic decays, $\Lambda^{0}_{b}\to p\pi^{-}, p K^{-},p\rho^{-},pK^{*-}$ and $\Lambda\phi$, within the re-scattering approach. The triangle diagrams at hadron level are calculated in form of loop integrations. It leads to the generation of strong phases, which is essential to the calculation of $CP$ asymmetries. We present numerical results for branching ratios, direct and partial-wave $CP$ asymmetries, decay asymmetry parameters and their associated $CP$ asymmetries. Our results are consistent with the current LHCb experimental data, which indicates the validity and potential of our approach in studying the $CP$ asymmetries of $b$-baryon decays. Most of our results are expected to be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognised earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that induced gravitational waves (IGWs) can naturally emerge within the framework of thermal leptogenesis models, thereby providing a robust probe for exploring this theory at remarkably high energy scales. To illustrate this principle, we put forth a basic leptogenesis model in which an early matter-dominated phase, tracing the leptogenesis scale, enhances the generation of gravitational waves induced by an early structure formation. Leveraging recent N-body and lattice simulation results for IGW computations in the non-linear regime, we show that it is possible to establish a direct link between the frequency and amplitude of these IGWs and the thermal leptogenesis scale.</description>

Abstract: We present a general formula for the amplitude of forward exclusive hadronic processes in the semihard regime of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), by means of the {\em next-to-leading order} eigenfunctions of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) kernel, as constructed by Chirilli and Kovchegov. We discuss some formal subtleties in the check of compatibility with the similar formula based on the use of the {\em leading-order} BFKL eigenfunctions. Finally, in the specific case of the electroproduction of two light vector mesons, we consider the numerical stability of the amplitude when one or the other set of eigenfunctions is adopted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the high energy channeling radiation data sets from the CERN-NA63 experiment using ultra relativistic synchrotron emission. To incorporate recoil, we examine the standard quasi-classical formalism as well as develop a formalism which includes the Unruh effect by utilizing a hyperbolic recoil acceleration, based on conservation of momentum, in the classical synchrotron trajectory. We also perform an asymptotic radiation time scale analysis which predicts a photon energy threshold, beyond which the Unruh effect dominates. We then compare the classical, quasi-classical, and Unruh synchrotron theories to the data. We find that above threshold, the Unruh effect saturates the spectrum of all data sets.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decays of possible pseudoscalar $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ molecular state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the new structure $G(3900)$ observed by the BESIII Collaboration in the $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$ was identified to be the $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ vector molecular resonance using a unified meson exchange model. Apart from the vector $P$-wave state, a possible pseudoscalar $P$-wave molecular state of the $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ [called $G_0(3900)$ for short] was also predicted, which is likely to be observed in future experiments. Within the molecular framework, we calculated the partial decay widths for a series of hadronic decays of the $G_0$, including $G_0\to \omega(\rho^0) J/\psi $, $\pi^+\pi^- \eta_c (1S)$, $\pi^+\pi^- \chi_{c1} (1P)$, and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$. Under present model parameters, the hidden-charm decay modes are dominated by the $G_0\to\omega J/\psi$ and $G_0\to\pi^+\pi^-\eta_c (1S)$, and the partial widths can reach 1 MeV and 0.1 MeV, respectively. The open-charm channel $G_0\to D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ exhibits a rather small decay rate ($\sim 0.1~\mathrm{keV}$). In terms of our present predictions, we suggest BESIII and Belle II to search for the pseudoscalar $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast / \bar{D}D^\ast$ molecular state with $J^{PC} = 0^{-+}$ in the hidden-charm processes $G_0 \to \omega J/\psi$ or $G_0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\eta_c(1S)$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a simple explanation for the observed hidden-charm pentaquarks as bound states in Born-Oppenheimer potentials. We identify $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4380)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)^+$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$ as the heavy-quark spin states in a quartet of $c \bar{c}$ pentaquarks with $J^P$ quantum numbers $\frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{5}{2}^-$. The quantum numbers of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$ differ from most previous predictions. We identify $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4338)^0$ and $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)^0$ as spin states in a triplet of $c \bar{c}s$ pentaquarks with quantum numbers $\frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{1}{2}^-$, and $\frac{3}{2}^-$. We explain why $P_{c\bar{c}}(4380)^+$ is the only observed hidden-charm pentaquark with a large width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the anomalous $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ decay under an external uniform magnetic field in the framework of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is seen that the full decay width gets strongly reduced with the external field, and that the differential width is almost independent of the direction of the outgoing photons. We also find that the result for the total width can be very well approximated by a simple expression obtained at the lowest order in the chiral expansion, which is just a direct extension to finite magnetic fields of the well-known $B=0$ result that follows from the anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten action. As a result, the magnetic suppression of the width can be understood in terms of the evolution of both the neutral pion mass and decay constant with the magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Recent study [1] has suggested that warm inflation may be realized with Standard Model gauge interaction alone. Motivated by this framework, we investigate the gravitational wave spectrum and graviton-portal dark matter production through the freeze-in process generated during warm inflation scenarios. We perform a comparative analysis for different dissipation terms, focusing on their distinct gravitational wave signatures in the high-frequency regime. Our findings reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectral behavior, offering a preliminary pathway for exploring inflationary and dark matter models through high-frequency gravitational wave signals.</description>

Abstract: We investigate photon-hadron Transverse Energy-Energy Correlation (TEEC) and azimuthal correlations in the forward rapidity region for proton-proton and proton-lead collisions within the small $x$ saturation formalism based on the Color Glass Condensate (CGC), supplemented by the initial-state and final-state parton shower simulation and hadronization using CASCADE. The study was performed in light of the upcoming FoCal detector of ALICE and the ATLAS detector upgrades with the extended pseudorapidity coverage. We predict a significant difference, at hadron-level, between the normalized TEECs in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions. Having a direct access to partonic subprocesses we also directly investigate the impact of the parton shower and hadronization on the TEEC. The ordinary azimuthal $\gamma$-hadron correlations show substantial suppression for proton-lead collision, as predicted earlier at parton-level.</description>

      <title>Robust semi-parametric signal detection in particle physics with classifiers decorrelated via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for signals of new physics in particle physics are usually done by training a supervised classifier to separate a signal model from the known Standard Model physics (also called the background model). However, even when the signal model is correct, systematic errors in the background model can influence supervised classifiers and might adversely affect the signal detection procedure. To tackle this problem, one approach is to use the (possibly misspecified) classifier only to perform a preliminary signal-enrichment step and then to carry out a signal detection test on the signal-rich sample. For this procedure to work, we need a classifier constrained to be decorrelated with one or more protected variables used for the signal-detection step. We do this by considering an optimal transport map of the classifier output that makes it independent of the protected variable(s) for the background. We then fit a semiparametric mixture model to the distribution of the protected variable after making cuts on the transformed classifier to detect the presence of a signal. We compare and contrast this decorrelation method with previous approaches, show that the decorrelation procedure is robust to moderate background misspecification, and analyze the power and validity of the signal detection test as a function of the cut on the classifier both with and without decorrelation. We conclude that decorrelation and signal enrichment help produce a stable, robust, valid, and more powerful test.</description>

      <title>Kinematically-enhanced interpolating operators for boosted hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to use interpolating operators for lattice quantum chromodyanmics (QCD) calculations of highly-boosted pions and nucleons with kinematically-enhanced ground-state overlap factors at large momentum. Because this kinematic enhancement applies to the signal but not the variance of the correlation function, these interpolating operators can achieve better signal-to-noise ratios at large momentum. We perform proof-of-principle calculations with boosted pions and nucleons using close-to-physical and larger quark masses to explore the utility of our proposal. Results for effective energies and matrix elements, as well as Lanczos ground-state energy estimators, are consistent with theoretical expectations for signal-to-noise improvement at large momenta.</description>

      <title>High-energy gamma-ray emission from memory-burdened primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on the memory-burden effect suggest that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with masses smaller than $10^{15}$ grams may be viable dark matter candidates and, consequently, be potential sources of high-energy particles in the present Universe. In this paper, we investigate the evaporation of memory-burdened PBHs into high-energy gamma-rays. Differently from previous analyses, we account for the attenuation of gamma-rays caused by their interaction with background radiation at energies above $10^5~{\rm GeV}$, as well as the secondary emission from the electromagnetic cascades generated during their propagation through extragalactic space. Performing a likelihood analysis with current gamma-ray data, we place new constraints on the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs. Our results show that ultra-high-energy diffuse gamma-ray observations set more restrictive bounds than high-energy neutrino data, particularly in scenarios with a strong memory-burden suppression of the PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>A $\nu$ look at the Sun: Probing the conditions of the solar core using $^8$B neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we estimate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models. Finally, we note that detailed forward modeling will be needed to develop the full potential of this approach.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. With these mean values of the potential parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and varying $N_{pivot}$ between $40$ to $55$, we also find that the $r-n_s$ predictions of our model lie well within the $1\sigma$ bounds of joint constraints from combined analysis of ACT, Planck-2018, BICEP and BAO observations. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous non-thermal fixed point in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of distinctly sub-diffusive scaling in the vicinity of an anomalous non-thermal fixed point is discussed in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas in the superfluid phase, carrying ensembles of vortices and antivortices with zero net angular momentum. The observed scaling behavior reflects coarsening dynamics driven by the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices, with the mean inter-defect distance growing algebraically over time as $\ell_\text{v}(t)\sim t^{\,\beta}$. A sub-diffusive ($\beta&lt;1/2$) exponent $\beta\approx0.2$ is extracted for various parameter regimes, initial conditions, and dipolar configurations from both scaling occupation-number spectra and the evolution of inter-defect distances as well as the corresponding total vortex densities. As vortex-antivortex annihilation progresses, excitations of the background condensate increase. This gives rise to a transition in the scaling behavior at late times, toward a non-thermal fixed point governed by diffusion-type scaling with $\beta\approx1/2$ as expected for the mutual annihilation of well-separated vortex-antivortex dipoles. While the temporal scaling with $\beta$ does not depend significantly on the strength and anisotropy of the dipolar interactions and thus underlines the universality of the anomalous as well as diffusion-type non-thermal fixed points, we find distinctly different vortex patterns resulting in the dipolar case. While in the superfluid with contact interactions only, same-sign vortices tend to cluster and form large-scale eddies, in the dipolar and tilted cases, roton excitations appear to prevent such motion, giving rather rise to a maximisation of distances between vortices of either sign.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on charged particles and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations, together with the full analysis of particle's trajectories, could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopole Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a variety of bound states of Dirac magnetic monopoles in product $U(1)$ gauge theories that make up a Dirac magnetic monopole with unit magnetic charge under the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group. The size of the bound states is determined by the balance between the repulsive magnetic Coulomb force of the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group and the attractive force from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes of the broken $U(1)$ gauge groups. These bound states are extensions of the configuration first studied in arXiv:1608.06951. We dub this type of configurations ``Magnetic Monopole Molecules'' (MMMs). Besides some illustrative examples of MMMs made of a small number of constituent Dirac magnetic monopoles, a method to combine smaller MMMs to construct larger MMMs is presented. Implications for the weak gravity conjecture are also discussed.</description>
