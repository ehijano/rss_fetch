      <title>Clustering of cosmic string loops within a Milky-way like halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loops of cosmic string experience a recoil from anisotropic gravitational radiation, known as the rocket effect, which influences the extent to which they are captured by galaxies during structure formation. Analytical studies have reached different conclusions regarding loop capture in galaxies: early treatments argued for efficient capture, while later analyses incorporating the loop rocket force throughout halo formation found that capture efficiency is reduced and strongly dependent on loop size. In this work, we employ the N-body simulation code GADGET-4, introducing non-backreacting tracer particles subject to a constant recoil force to model cosmic string loops with the rocket effect. We simulate the formation of a Milky-Way-like halo from redshift $z=127$ to $z=0$, considering loop populations characterized by a range of length parameters $\xi$, inversely proportional to the rocket acceleration. We find that the number of captured loops exhibits a pronounced peak at $\xi_{\textrm{peak}}\simeq 12.5$, arising from the competition between rocket-driven ejection at small $\xi$ and the declining intrinsic loop abundance at large $\xi$. For fiducial string tensions, this corresponds to $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ loops within the halo. We further find that loops with weak rocket forces closely trace the dark-matter distribution, while those subject to stronger recoil but still captured -- particularly the most abundant loops near $\xi_{\textrm{peak}}$ -- are preferentially concentrated toward the central regions of the halo.</description>

      <title>The Tianlai-WIYN North Celestial Cap Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a small, low redshift spectroscopic survey of galaxies within 3 degrees of the North Celestial Pole (NCP) selected using V-band photometry obtained from the North Celestial Cap Survey (NCCS) (Gorbikov &amp; Brosch 2014). The purpose of the current survey is to create a redshift space template for 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen with which to correlate radio line intensity observations by the Tianlai dish and cylinder interferometers. A total of 898 redshifts were obtained from the 2102 extended objects in the NCCS with m_V &lt; 19 in the survey area. After accounting for extinction, the survey geometry and selection effects, the number density and clustering pattern of galaxies in the redshift catalog are consistent with other low redshift surveys. We were also able to identify 11 galaxy cluster candidates from this redshift catalog.</description>

      <title>$S_8-H_0$ tension in a SI-ULDM scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of a transient self-interaction phase in Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM), focusing on its simultaneous effects on the sound horizon and the late-time growth of structure. In the presence of a quartic self-interaction, the scalar field undergoes a short-lived radiation-like phase before evolving into matter-like behaviour, inducing a localized modification of the expansion history at early times. We develop a perturbative and model-independent framework in which the self-interaction energy density is parametrized as a localized contribution to the total energy budget. Within this approach, the responses of the sound horizon and the linear growth factor can be expressed as weighted integrals over cosmic time, with distinct kernels encoding the temporal sensitivity of each observable. This structure leads to a simple analytic relation linking the corresponding early- and late-time responses, and naturally predicts correlated shifts in $H_0$ and $S_8$ whose sign and magnitude depend on the timing of the self-interaction episode. Our results show that a single transient modification of the expansion history can interpolate between early-time effects on the sound horizon and late-time suppression of structure growth within a unified physical framework, providing an analytical understanding of their joint response.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravitating Scalar Field Configurations, Ultra Light Dark Matter and Galactic Scale Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the possibility that dark matter consists of ultra light spin-zero particles with mass $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$. We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $\lambda$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $\lambda$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $\lambda \sim \pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$ and $\lambda \gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sachs-Wolfe maps from the Gower Street $w$CDM simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late-time linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect directly probes the dynamics of cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark energy. Detecting these weak, secondary temperature anisotropy signals of the CMB requires accurate theoretical predictions of their amplitude across cosmological models. By extending the pyGenISW package, previously limited to $\Lambda$CDM, we aim to generate full-sky ISW maps for a suite of 791 $w$CDM cosmologies using the Gower Street N-body simulations, thereby enabling ISW analyses across a broader dark-energy parameter space. We make our code and ISW data publicly available. We compute the ISW signals by tracing the time evolution of the gravitational potential across large-volume simulations that span dark energy equation of state parameters from phantom to quintessence, $-1.79 \lesssim w \lesssim -0.34$. These data are projected onto the sphere using HEALPix to obtain full-sky temperature maps. We validate our pipeline by comparing the measured ISW angular power spectra and ISW-density cross-correlations against linear theory expectations ($2 \leq \ell \leq 200$) computed with benchmarks from the pyCCL library. The agreement is excellent across the multipole range where the ISW contribution is expected to dominate, confirming the reliability of our modelling of gravitational-potential evolution. With additional tests of the ISW signal's strength in density extrema, as well as comparing all models to a reference $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we found that quintessence-like models ($w &gt; -1$) show higher ISW amplitudes than phantom models ($w &lt; -1$), consistent with enhanced late-time decay of gravitational potentials. The consistency of our $w$CDM ISW maps and their agreement with theory predictions confirm the robustness of our methodology, establishing it as a reliable tool for theoretical and observational ISW-LSS analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models build an effective representations of data that can be deployed on diverse downstream tasks. Previous research developed the OmniLearned foundation model for collider physics and showed that it could significantly advance discovery potential across collider experiments. In this paper we go beyond collider physics and show that Foundation Models trained on collider data can help improve the prediction of cosmological parameters and to predict halo and galaxy velocities in different datasets from CosmoBench. This is the first time a collider physics model is shown to generalize across scientific fields.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory for Biased Tracers via the Boltzmann-Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective theory for biased tracers formulated at the level of the Boltzmann equation, providing a unified description of density and velocity bias. We introduce a general effective collision term in the tracer Boltzmann equation to encode tracer dynamics that are intrinsically different from those of dark matter. This collision operator leads to modified continuity and Euler equations, with source terms reflecting the collision-term physics. At linear order, this framework predicts time- and scale-dependent bias parameters in a self-consistent manner, encompassing peak bias as a special case while clarifying how velocity bias and higher-derivative effects arise. Applying the resulting bias model to redshift-space distortions, we show that the Boltzmann-equation approach reproduces the power spectrum of biased tracers obtained in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure up to $k^4$ terms with fewer independent parameters.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics and observational constraints of an interacting early scalar field coupled to radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmic evolution of an interacting scalar field radiation model, in which a minimally coupled scalar field exchanges energy with the radiation sector through an exponential coupling. Extending previous formulations, a non-relativistic matter component is included explicitly, which allows a self consistent description of cosmological dynamics from the radiation-dominated era to late-time acceleration. Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times. Model comparison suggest that the interacting scenario is statistically competitive but not decisively preferred by current background data.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Himalayas in CROCODILE : Probing the Extreme Quasar Overdensities by Count-in-Cells analysis and Nearest Neighbor Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) -- an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 -- poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.</description>

      <title>Towards precision cosmology with Voids x CMB correlations (I): Roman-Agora mock catalogs and pipeline validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and validate a set of multi-purpose mock galaxy catalogs designed to capture, to different degrees of accuracy, the main characteristics of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey. These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog -- containing basic properties of the host halos -- into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Feeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical--UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\mathring{\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples. Our results reveal a non-negligible $\gtrsim 0.05$ mag difference between low- and high-$z$ SALT3-UV models in the $g-$band at $z\gtrsim0.5$ and the $u-$band at $z\gtrsim0.2$. We demonstrate that, if confirmed, such evolution could lead to a few-percent bias in the measurement of $w$ if high-$z$ rest-frame UV data are included in future cosmological surveys such as LSST and $\textit{Roman}$.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapped Theories of Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a novel scenario for a strongly coupled spectator sector during inflation, that of a higher dimensional conformal field theory with large anomalous dimensions -- ``unparticles" -- and compactify the extra dimensions. More specifically, we take generalized free fields in five dimensions, where the extra dimension is compactified to a circle. Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario ``gapped unparticles". We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars. If we assume the interactions are localized on a brane, gapped unparticles with different effective masses will share a universal coupling, and their exchanges produce an interesting interference pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the cosmological collider program, which aims to probe high-energy physics through inflation, we investigate the phase diagram of multi-flavor QCD in de Sitter spacetime with a flavor-universal axial chemical potential induced by a rolling inflaton coupled to fermions. We determine the first-order critical line and a critical point as functions of the Hubble parameter and the axial chemical potential, employing an effective description of chiral symmetry breaking within the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We find that a first-order chiral phase transition may occur during inflation or at its end when the axial chemical potential is sufficiently large and crosses the critical line. This provides a cosmological collider analogue of the QCD phase diagram explored in heavy-ion colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Background Force and the Galactic Center GeV Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of background-induced forces on dark matter (DM) annihilation and their implications for indirect detection. In the presence of a finite number density of background particles, loop-level interactions can generate an effective force that is significantly enhanced relative to the vacuum case. We construct a two-component DM model in which the dominant component is a fermionic particle $\chi$ and the subdominant component is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle $\phi$. The annihilation of $\chi$ proceeds through the p-wave channel and produces gamma-ray emission. The finite density of $\phi$ particles induces a background-enhanced force between $\chi$ particles, leading to a sizable Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation. We show that a viable region of parameter space in this model can account for the gamma-ray excess observed in the Galactic Center using Fermi-LAT data. The background-induced force substantially amplifies the Sommerfeld enhancement and thus enlarges the parameter space capable of explaining the excess, highlighting the importance of background effects in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis results refined via the Trojan Horse Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the Trojan Horse Method (THM) as a powerful technique for measuring nuclear reaction cross sections at astrophysical energies. We then explore the impact of THM-derived reaction rates on the predictions of Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (SBBN) using the PRIMAT code. Primordial abundances are shown for the single rate impact and, for the first time, also for all the THM rates together. The result shows significant differences with the use of THM rates, which in some cases goes in the direction of improving the agreement with the observations with respect to the use of only reaction rates from direct data, especially for the $^7$Li and deuterium abundances, which are still open issues for SBBN.</description>

      <title>Higgs-like inflation in scalar-torsion $f(T,\phi)$ gravity in light of ACT-SPT-DESI constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Higgs-like inflation in the framework of scalar-torsion gravity, focusing on the general class of $f(T,\phi)$ theories in which gravitation is mediated by torsion rather than curvature. Motivated by the increasing precision of cosmic microwave background and large-scale-structure observations, we examine whether Higgs-like inflation remains compatible with current data in this extended gravitational setting. Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,\phi)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures.</description>

      <title>Loop-Level Lepton Flavor Violation and Diphoton Signals in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_\beta \to \ell_\alpha + X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole dark matter from ultra-slow-roll inflation in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>When Dark Matter Heats Up: A Model-Independent Search for Non-Cold Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article questions the common assumption of cold dark matter (DM) by exploring the possibility of a non-zero equation of state (EoS) without relying on any parametric approach. In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w_{\rm DM} = 0$, an assumption that aligns with large-scale structure formation, supports the empirical success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and simplifies cosmological modeling. However, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a non-zero $w_{\rm DM}$ from the cosmological framework. In this work, we explore this possibility through non-parametric and parametric reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructions use Hubble parameter measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR1 and DR2. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although only mildly supported statistically, cannot be conclusively ruled out. Notably, we observe a mild tendency ($\sim 1\sigma$) toward a negative $w_{\rm DM}$ at the present epoch, which is most likely due to inconsistencies between the BAO data from DESI and other datasets.</description>

      <title>Growth Index in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better distinguish the nature of $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, it is necessary to separate the effects of expansion and the growth of structure. The growth index $\gamma$ was identified as the most important parameter that characterizes the growth of density fluctuations independently of the effects of cosmic expansion. In the $\Lambda$CDM model, analyses performed with various cosmological datasets indicate that the growth index has to be larger than its theoretically predicted value. Cosmological models based on $f(R)$ gravity theories have scale-dependent growth indices, whose values are even more at odds with the growth rate data. In this work, we evaluate the growth index in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model both theoretically and numerically. Although based on $f(R)$ gravity theory, we show through several analyses with different combinations of datasets that the growth index in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model is very close in value to the $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM models. The growth of structure is suppressed in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model, which is formulated with the extended gravitational growth framework. Upon analyzing cosmological data, we ascertain that the $\gamma\delta$CDM model is equally competitive as the $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM models.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Evaporating before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed from the collapse of density fluctuations provide a unique window into the physics of the early Universe. Their evaporation through Hawking radiation around the epoch of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) can leave measurable imprints on the primordial light-element abundances. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of PBHs evaporating before BBN, with various intermediate steps understood analytically, and obtain the BBN constraint on PBHs within a transparent and reproducible framework. We find that, to produce observable effects on BBN, the PBH mass must exceed $10^{9}$ g, a threshold higher than that reported in some earlier studies. Slightly above $10^{9}$ g, the BBN sensitivity rapidly increases with the mass and then decreases, with the turning point occurring at $2\times10^{9}$ g. For PBHs in the mass range $[10^{9},\ 10^{10}]$ g, current measurements of BBN observables set an upper bound on the initial mass fraction parameter $\beta$ ranging from $10^{-17}$ to $10^{-19}$. To facilitate future improvements, we make our code publicly available, enabling straightforward incorporation of updated nuclear reaction rates, particle-physics inputs, and cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Decoupling perturbations from background in $f(Q)$ gravity: the square-root correction and the alleviation of the $\sigma_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a perturbation-level modification of symmetric teleparallel gravity of the form $f(Q)=F(Q)+M\sqrt{Q}$ and assess its ability to ease the $\sigma_8$ tension. The square-root term leaves the background expansion unchanged while modifying the effective gravitational coupling, providing a pure decoupling between background cosmology and structure-growth evolution. Using the latest redshift-space distortion data, including DESI DR1 Full-Shape measurements, we constrain $M$ and $\sigma_8$ across three representative backgrounds: $\Lambda$CDM, an $H_0$-tension-reducing model, and a DESI-motivated dynamical dark energy scenario. In all cases, the square-root correction suppresses growth and can reconcile $\sigma_8$ with Planck at the $1\sigma$ level, with the strongest improvement occurring in the $H_0$-tension-oriented background. A residual degeneracy between $M$ and $\sigma_8$ remains, indicating that future multi-probe analyses combining lensing and full-shape clustering will be required to determine whether the $\sqrt{Q}$ term represents a genuine signal of modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe during the first-order electroweak phase transition. We first study the generation of the helical magnetic field in the framework of the standard model effective field theory with a CP-violating operator. We show that, when the chiral magnetic effect is absent, the helical magnetic field and effective chemical potential cannot generate enough baryon asymmetry when vacuum bubbles collide. We further find that the chiral magnetic effect can amplify the lepton asymmetry in the early universe during the phase transition. We present the baryon asymmetry interpretation requirement on certain parameter spaces of the phase transition and the primordial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>RHINO: A large horn antenna for detecting the 21cm global signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sky-averaged brightness temperature of the 21cm line from neutral hydrogen provides a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium, particularly before and during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation. This `global signal' is faint, on the order of tens to hundreds of millikelvin, and spectrally relatively smooth, making it exceedingly difficult to disentangle from foreground radio emission and instrumental artefacts. In this paper, we introduce RHINO, an experiment based around a large horn antenna operating from 60-85 MHz. Horn antennas are highly characterisable and provide excellent shielding from their immediate environment, which are potentially decisive advantages when it comes to the beam measurement and modelling problems that are particularly challenging for this kind of experiment. The system also includes a novel continuous wave calibration source to control correlated gain fluctuations, allowing continuous monitoring of the overall gain level without needing to rapidly switch between the sky and a calibration source. Here, we describe the basic RHINO concept, including the antenna design, EM simulations, and receiver electronics. We use a basic simulation and analysis pipeline to study the impact of the limited bandwidth on recovery of physical 21cm global signal model parameters, and discuss a basic calibration scheme that incorporates the continuous wave signal. Finally, we report on the current state of a scaled-down prototype system under construction at Jodrell Bank Observatory.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Thermal Graviton Remnant from the End of Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard inflationary theory focuses on the freezing of super-horizon fluctuations, which generate a scale-invariant spectrum, while the sub-horizon modes are expected to remain in thermal equilibrium. Building upon recent development of quantum thermodynamics of the de Sitter universe, we investigate the graviton remnant originating from this thermal horizon radiation released at the end of inflation. Unlike the stochastic background from super-horizon fluctuations, this signal represents a snapshot of the thermal dS state, which subsequently decouples and undergoes cosmological redshift. We present a semi-analytical approximation prediction for this relic background, typically peaking in near MHz band, with characteristic energy density of $\log_{10}(\Omega_{\rm G} h^2) \sim \mathcal{O}(-18)$. These signals occupy a High-Frequency band, offering a potential novel probe of the reheating temperature and the thermal history of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Confirmation of a Remarkable Linear Trail of Galaxies in the NGC 1052 Field, Consistent with Formation in a High-Speed Bullet Dwarf Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC 1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate, kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A 'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual properties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Updating GUT-Scale Pole Higgs Inflation After ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM. We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355&lt;=p&lt;=6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;= N&lt;=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated by embedding the model into a B-L extension of MSSM.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Capture in a Core-Collapse Supernova Revives Dark Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae serve as powerful probes of light, weakly coupled particles, such as dark photons. The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a "dark photosphere" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>NGC 3521 as the Milky Way near twin: spectral energy distribution from UV to radio decameter ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}&lt;11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</description>
