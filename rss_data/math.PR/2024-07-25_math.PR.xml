      <title>Phase transition for tree-rooted maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of tree-rooted planar maps weighted by their number of $2$-connected blocks. We study its enumerative properties and prove that it undergoes a phase transition. We give the distribution of the size of the largest $2$-connected blocks in the three regimes (subcritical, critical and supercritical) and further establish that the scaling limit is the Brownian Continuum Random Tree in the critical and supercritical regimes, with respective rescalings $\sqrt{n/\log(n)}$ and $\sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of the martingale central limit theorem in Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For martingales with a wide range of integrability, we will quantify the rate of convergence of the central limit theorem via Wasserstein distances of order $r$, $1\le r\le 3$. Our bounds are in terms of Lyapunov's coefficients and the $\mathscr L^{r/2}$ fluctuation of the total conditional variances. We will show that our Wasserstein-1 bound is optimal up to a multiplicative constant.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and It{\^o}'s formula for weak Dirichlet processes: an equivalence result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective consists in generalizing a well-known It{\^o} formula of J. Jacod and A. Shiryaev: given a c{\`a}dl{\`a}g process S, there is an equivalence between the fact that S is a semimartingale with given characteristics (B^k , C, $\nu$) and a It{\^o} formula type expansion of F (S), where F is a bounded function of class C2. This result connects weak solutions of path-dependent SDEs and related martingale problems. We extend this to the case when S is a weak Dirichlet process. A second aspect of the paper consists in discussing some untreated features of stochastic calculus for finite quadratic variation processes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Aggregation Diffusion-Equation : Analysis via Dirichlet Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the stochastic aggregation-diffusion equation with a singular drift represented by a monotone radial kernel. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a diffusion process that acts as a weak solution to our equation. This process can be described as a distorted Brownian motion originating from a delocalized point. Utilizing Dirichlet form theory, we prove the existence of a weak solution for a quasi-everywhere point in a state space. However uniqueness is not assured for solutions commencing from points outside polar sets, and explicitly characterizing these sets poses a significant challenge. To address this, we employ the H_2-condition introduced by Albeverio et al.(2003). This condition provides a more thorough understanding of the uniqueness issue within the framework of Dirichlet forms. Consequently the H_2-condition is pivotal in enhancing the analysis of weak solutions, ensuring a more detailed comprehension of the problem. An explicit expression for the generalized Schr\"odinger operator associated with certain kernels is also provided.</description>

      <title>Estimating the hyperuniformity exponent of point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of estimating the hyperuniformity exponent $\alpha$ of a spatial point process, given only one realization of it. Assuming that the structure factor $S$ of the point process follows a vanishing power law at the origin (the typical case of a hyperuniform point process), this exponent is defined as the slope near the origin of $\log S$. Our estimator is built upon the (expanding window) asymptotic variance of some wavelet transforms of the point process. By combining several scales and several wavelets, we develop a multi-scale, multi-taper estimator $\widehat{\alpha}$. We analyze its asymptotic behavior, proving its consistency under various settings, and enabling the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals for $\alpha$ when $\alpha &lt; d$ and under Brillinger mixing. This construction is derived from a multivariate central limit theorem where the normalisations are non-standard and vary among the components. We also present a non-asymptotic deviation inequality providing insights into the influence of tapers on the bias-variance trade-off of $\widehat{\alpha}$. Finally, we investigate the performance of $\widehat{\alpha}$ through simulations, and we apply our method to the analysis of hyperuniformity in a real dataset of marine algae.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Stockwell Transform and its Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincar\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Poisson point processes and of optimal transport regularization with application in variational analysis of PET reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson distributed measurements in inverse problems often stem from Poisson point processes that are observed through discretized or finite-resolution detectors, one of the most prominent examples being positron emission tomography (PET). These inverse problems are typically reconstructed via Bayesian methods. A natural question then is whether and how the reconstruction converges as the signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity and how this convergence interacts with other parameters such as the detector size. In this article we carry out a corresponding variational analysis for the exemplary Bayesian reconstruction functional from [arXiv:2311.17784,arXiv:1902.07521], which considers dynamic PET imaging (i.e.\ the object to be reconstructed changes over time) and uses an optimal transport regularization.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Maximal Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A {\em maximal inequality} seeks to estimate $\mathbb{E}\max_i X_i$ in terms of properties of the $X_i$. When the latter are independent, the union bound (in its various guises) can yield tight upper bounds. If, however, the $X_i$ are strongly dependent, the estimates provided by the union bound will be rather loose. In this note, we show that for non-negative random variables, pairwise independence suffices for the maximal inequality to behave comparably to its independent version. The condition of pairwise independence may be relaxed to a kind of negative dependence, and even the latter admits violations -- provided these are properly quantified.</description>

      <title>Zero-One Laws for Random Feasibility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general random model of a combinatorial optimization problem with geometric structure that encapsulates both linear programming and integer linear programming. Let $Q$ be a bounded set called the feasible set, $E$ be an arbitrary set called the constraint set, and $A$ be a random linear transform. We define and study the $\ell^q$-margin, $M_q := d_q(AQ, E)$. The margin quantifies the feasibility of finding $y \in AQ$ satisfying the constraint $y \in E$. Our contribution is to establish strong concentration of the margin for any $q \in (2,\infty]$, assuming only that $E$ has permutation symmetry. The case of $q = \infty$ is of particular interest in applications -- specifically to combinatorial ``balancing'' problems -- and is markedly out of the reach of the classical isoperimetric and concentration-of-measure tools that suffice for $q \le 2$.
  Generality is a key feature of this result: we assume permutation symmetry of the constraint set and nothing else. This allows us to encode many optimization problems in terms of the margin, including random versions of: the closest vector problem, integer linear feasibility, perceptron-type problems, $\ell^q$-combinatorial discrepancy for $2 \le q \le \infty$, and matrix balancing. Concentration of the margin implies a host of new sharp threshold results in these models, and also greatly simplifies and extends some key known results.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the explicit bijection between the density of singular values and the density of eigenvalues for bi-unitarily invariant complex random matrix ensembles of finite matrix size, we aim at finding the induced probability measure on $j$ eigenvalues and $k$ singular values that we coin $j,k$-point correlation measure. We find an expression for the $1,k$-point correlation measure which simplifies drastically when assuming that the singular values follow a polynomial ensemble, yielding a closed formula in terms of the kernel corresponding to the determinantal point process of the singular value statistics. These expressions simplify even further when the singular values are drawn from a P\'{o}lya ensemble and extend known results between the eigenvalue and singular value statistics of the corresponding bi-unitarily invariant ensemble.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Causal Identification for Complex Continuous-time Functional Longitudinal Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12525v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring in modern medical research introduces functional longitudinal data, characterized by continuous-time measurements of outcomes, treatments, and confounders. This complexity leads to uncountably infinite treatment-confounder feedbacks, which traditional causal inference methodologies cannot handle. Inspired by the coarsened data framework, we adopt stochastic process theory, measure theory, and net convergence to propose a nonparametric causal identification framework. This framework generalizes classical g-computation, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust formulas, accommodating time-varying outcomes subject to mortality and censoring. Our approach addresses significant gaps in current methodologies, providing a solution for complex, real-time longitudinal data and paving the way for future estimation work in this domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a countably infinite number of states. The $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) threshold objective is to maximize the probability that the $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) of the infinite sequence of directly seen rewards is non-negative. We establish the complete picture of the strategy complexity of these objectives, i.e., the upper and lower bounds on the memory required by $\varepsilon$-optimal (resp. optimal) strategies. We then apply these results to solve two open problems from (Sudderth, Decisions in Economics and Finance, 2020) about the strategy complexity of optimal strategies for the expected $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) payoff.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Uniform Convergence of Time Discretisation Schemes for SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove convergence rates for time discretisation schemes for semi-linear stochastic evolution equations with additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise, where the leading operator $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $S$ on a Hilbert space $X$, and the focus is on non-parabolic problems. The main results are optimal bounds for the uniform strong error $$\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty} := \Big(\mathbb{E} \sup_{j\in \{0, \ldots, N_k\}} \|U(t_j) - U^j\|^p\Big)^{1/p},$$ where $p \in [2,\infty)$, $U$ is the mild solution, $U^j$ is obtained from a time discretisation scheme, $k$ is the step size, and $N_k = T/k$. The usual schemes such as the exponential Euler, the implicit Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson method, etc. are included as special cases. Under conditions on the nonlinearity and the noise, we show
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (linear equation, additive noise, general $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim \sqrt{k} \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (nonlinear equation, multiplicative noise, contractive $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (nonlinear wave equation, multiplicative noise)
  for a large class of time discretisation schemes. The logarithmic factor can be removed if the exponential Euler method is used with a (quasi)-contractive $S$. The obtained bounds coincide with the optimal bounds for SDEs. Most of the existing literature is concerned with bounds for the simpler pointwise strong error $$\mathrm{E}_k:=\bigg(\sup_{j\in \{0,\ldots,N_k\}}\mathbb{E} \|U(t_j) - U^{j}\|^p\bigg)^{1/p}.$$ Applications to Maxwell equations, Schr\"odinger equations, and wave equations are included. For these equations, our results improve and reprove several existing results with a unified method and provide the first results known for the implicit Euler and the Crank-Nicolson method.</description>

      <title>Optimal worst-risk minimization in structural equation models with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The insight that causal parameters are particularly suitable for out-of-sample prediction has sparked a lot development of causal-like predictors. However, the connection with strict causal targets, has limited the development with good risk minimization properties, but without a direct causal interpretation. In this manuscript we derive the optimal out-of-sample risk minimizing predictor of a certain target $Y$ in a non-linear system $(X,Y)$ that has been trained in several within-sample environments. We consider data from an observation environment, and several shifted environments. Each environment corresponds to a structural equation model (SEM), with random coefficients and with its own shift and noise vector, both in $L^2$. Unlike previous approaches, we also allow shifts in the target value. We define a sieve of out-of-sample environments, consisting of all shifts $\tilde{A}$ that are at most $\gamma$ times as strong as any weighted average of the observed shift vectors. For each $\beta\in\mathbb{R}^p$ we show that the supremum of the risk functions $R_{\tilde{A}}(\beta)$ has a worst-risk decomposition into a (positive) non-linear combination of risk functions, depending on $\gamma$. We then define the set $\mathcal{B}_\gamma$, as minimizers of this risk. The main result of the paper is that there is a unique minimizer ($|\mathcal{B}_\gamma|=1$) that can be consistently estimated by an explicit estimator, outside a set of zero Lebesgue measure in the parameter space. A practical obstacle for the initial method of estimation is that it involves the solution of a general degree polynomials. Therefore, we prove that an approximate estimator using the bisection method is also consistent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a general approach to dimer models analogous to Krichever's scheme in the theory of integrable systems. We start with a Riemann surface and the simplest generic meromorphic functions on it and demonstrate how to obtain integrable dimer models. These are dimer models on doubly periodic bipartite graphs with quasi-periodic positive weights. Dimer models with periodic weights and Harnack curves are recovered as a special case. This generalization from Harnack curves to general M-curves leads to transparent algebro-geometric structures. In particular explicit formulas for the Ronkin function and surface tension as integrals of meromorphic differentials on M-curves are obtained. Furthermore we describe the variational principle for the height function in the quasi-periodic case. Based on Schottky uniformizations of Riemann surfaces we present concrete computational results including computing the weights and sampling dimer configurations with them. The computational results are in complete agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>
