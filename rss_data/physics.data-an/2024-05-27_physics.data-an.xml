      <title>Multi-Point Gradient Estimation in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying turbulence, it is often desirable to be able to estimate the local spatial gradient of a vector quantity using in situ measurements from a small number of irregularly spaced points. While previous studies have focused on the accuracy of these methods as the number of measurement points varies, we focus on the accuracy of gradient estimations as a function of shape of the measurement point configuration. We find that for well-shaped configurations that are of correct relative size, we can very accurately estimate the local spatial gradient using only four points.</description>

      <title>Seeing the World through an Antenna's Eye: Reception Quality Visualization Using Incomplete Technical Signal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We come up with a novel application for image analysis methods in the context of direction dependent signal characteristics. For this purpose, we describe an inpainting approach adding benefit to technical signal information which are typically only used for monitoring and control purposes in ground station operations. Recalling the theoretical properties of the employed inpainting technique and appropriate modeling allow us to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for satellite data reception quality assessment. In our application, we show the advantages of inpainting products over raw data as well as the rich potential of the visualization of technical signal information.</description>

      <title>A graph-space optimal transport FWI approach based on \kappa-generalized Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical basis for conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI) approaches is commonly associated with Gaussian statistics. However, errors are rarely Gaussian in non-linear problems like FWI. In this work, we investigate the portability of a new objective function for FWI applications based on the graph-space optimal transport and $\kappa$-generalized Gaussian probability distribution. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed objective function is robust in mitigating two critical problems in FWI, which are associated with cycle skipping issues and non-Gaussian errors. The results reveal that our proposal can mitigate the negative influence of cycle-skipping ambiguity and non-Gaussian noises and reduce the computational runtime for computing the transport plan associated with the optimal transport theory.</description>

      <title>Online Mean Estimation for Multi-frame Optical Fiber Signals On Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of Big Data, prompt analysis and processing of data sets is critical. Meanwhile, statistical methods provide key tools and techniques to extract valuable insights and knowledge from complex data sets. This paper creatively applies statistical methods to the field of traffic, particularly focusing on the preprocessing of multi-frame signals obtained by optical fiber-based Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system. An online non-parametric regression model based on Local Polynomial Regression (LPR) and variable bandwidth selection is employed to dynamically update the estimation of mean function as signals flow in. This mean estimation method can derive average information of multi-frame fiber signals, thus providing the basis for the subsequent vehicle trajectory extraction algorithms. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparison experiments were conducted under real highway scenarios, showing that our approach not only deals with multi-frame signals more accurately than the classical filter-based Kalman and Wavelet methods, but also meets the needs better under the condition of saving memory and rapid responses. It provides a new reliable means for signal processing which can be integrated with other existing methods.</description>
