      <title>A Short History of the First 50 Years: from the GRB Prompt Emission and Afterglow Discoveries to the Multimessenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than fifty years have been elapsed from the first discovery of a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) with the American Vela satellites, and more than twenty-five years from the discovery with the BeppoSAX satellite of the first X-ray afterglow of a GRB. Thanks to the afterglow discovery and to the possibility given to the optical and radio astronomers to discover the GRB optical counterparts, the long-time mystery about the origin of these events was solved. Now we know that GRBs are huge explosions, mainly ultra relativistic jets, in galaxies at cosmological distances. Starting from the first GRB detection with the Vela satellites, I will review the story of these discoveries, those obtained with BeppoSAX, the contribution to GRBs by other satellites and ground experiments, among them Venera, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, HETE2, Swift, Fermi, AGILE, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., which were, and some of them are still, very important for the study of GRB properties. Then I will review the main results obtained thus far and the still open problems and prospects of the GRB astronomy.</description>

      <title>Delayed jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with realistic initial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a long-lived hyper-massive neutron star merger remnant (post-merger lifetime $&gt;250$ ms) that has been obtained via large eddy simulations with a gradient subgrid-scale model. We find a clear helicoidal magnetic field structure that is governed by the toroidal component of the magnetic field. Although no jet emerges during the simulation time, we observe at late times a significant increase of the poloidal component of the magnetic field at all scales. We also compare with the results of several binary neutron star simulations with moderate resolution of $120$~m, that are evolved up to $50$~ms after the merger, which differ in terms of the initial topology and strength of the magnetic field. We find that the best choice is an isotropic small-scale magnetic field distribution that mimics the turbulent state that generically develops during the merger. This initial configuration reaches a closer agreement with our high-resolution simulation results than the purely dipolar large-scale fields that are commonly employed in these type of simulations. This provides a recipe to perform such simulations avoiding the computationally expensive grids required to faithfully capture the amplification of the magnetic field by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.</description>

      <title>Late Jets, Early Sparks: Illuminating the Pre-Maximum Bumps in Superluminous Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) radiate $\gtrsim 10-100$ times more energy than ordinary stellar explosions, implicating a novel power source behind these enigmatic events. One frequently discussed source, particularly for hydrogen-poor (Type I) SLSNe, is a central engine such as a millisecond magnetar or accreting black hole. Both black hole and magnetar engines are expected to channel a fraction of their luminosity into a collimated relativistic jet. Using 3D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the interaction of a relativistic jet, endowed with a luminosity $L_{\rm j}\approx10^{45}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ and duration $t_{\rm eng} \approx$ days compatible with those needed to power SLSNe, launched into the envelope of the exploding star. The jet successfully breaks through the expanding ejecta and its shocked cocoon powers ultraviolet/optical emission lasting several days after the explosion and reaching a peak luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a sizable fraction of $L_{\rm j}$. This high radiative efficiency is the result of the modest adiabatic losses the cocoon experiences due to the low optical depths of the enlarged ejecta at these late times, e.g., compared to the more compact stars in gamma-ray bursts. The luminosity and temperature of the cocoon emission match those of the ``bumps'' in SLSNe light curves observed weeks prior to the optical maximum in many SLSNe. Confirmation of jet breakout signatures by future observations (e.g., days to weeks-long internal X-ray emission from the jet for on-axis observers, spectroscopy confirming large photosphere velocities $v/c \gtrsim 0.1$, or detection of a radio afterglow) would offer strong evidence for central engines powering SLSNe.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Rapid Variability at High Energies in GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic variability was searched for in arrival times of six gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at high energies -- between 30 MeV and 2 GeV -- detected by the Fermi satellite's Large Area Telescope (LAT). The GRBs were selected from the Fermi LAT catalog with preference for events with numerous photons, a strong initial pulse, and measured redshifts. Three long GRBs and three short GRBs were selected and tested. Two different variability-detection algorithms were deployed, one counting photons in pairs, and the other multiplying time gaps between photons. In both tests, a real GRB was compared to 1000 Monte-Carlo versions of itself smoothed over a wide range of different timescales. The minimum detected variability timescales for long bursts (GRB 080916C, GRB 090926A, GRB 131108A) was found to be (0.005, 10.0, 10.0) seconds for the photon pair test and (2.0, 20.0, 10.0) seconds for the time-gap multiplication test. Additionally, the minimum detected variability timescales for the short bursts (GRB 090510, GRB 140619B, GRB 160709A) was found to be (0.05, 0.01, 20.0) seconds for the photon pair test and (0.05, 0.01, 20.0) seconds for the gap multiplication test. Statistical uncertainties in these times are about a factor of 2. The durations of these variability timescales may be used to constrain the geometry, dynamics, speed, cosmological dispersion, Lorentz-invariance violations, weak equivalence principle violations, and GRB models.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Effects on the Luminosity of Neutrino-Dominated Accretion Flows Around Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar-mass black hole surrounded by the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is proposed to be the central engine of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we investigate the neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity from the NDAF and pair-annihilation model, taking into account the neutrino oscillation above the accretion disk. The disk hydrodynamical properties are modelled using the empirical solution previously derived with boundary conditions including the effect of electron degeneracy and neutrino trapping. Our key parameters are the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin given in the range of $\dot{M} = 0.1$ - $10$ $M_\odot$ s$^{-1}$ and $ 0 \le a &lt; 1$, respectively. Without neutrino oscillation, the obtained neutrino/anti-neutrino luminosity is $\sim 10^{51}$ - $10^{53}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, while the neutrino annihilation luminosity is found to be $\sim 10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. In the presence of neutrino oscillation in the vacuum limit, the electron neutrino annihilation luminosity decreases by $\lesssim 22\%$ through the flavor transformation, while the muon- and tau-neutrino luminosity can increase up to $\sim 45\%$ and $ 60\%$, respectively. As a result, the total annihilation luminosity can be reduced up to $\sim 19\%$ due to the oscillation process above the disk. Finally, we also investigate the case whereby the CP-violating phase is changed from $\delta \textrm{CP} =$ $0^{\circ}$ to $245^{\circ}$. However, our results reveal that the CP-violating phase has minimal impact on neutrino annihilation luminosity.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr data set: Posterior predictive checks for gravitational-wave detection with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar-timing-array experiments have reported evidence for a stochastic background of nanohertz gravitational waves consistent with the signal expected from a population of supermassive--black-hole binaries. Those analyses assume power-law spectra for intrinsic pulsar noise and for the background, as well as a Hellings--Downs cross-correlation pattern among the gravitational-wave--induced residuals across pulsars. These assumptions are idealizations that may not be realized in actuality. We test them in the NANOGrav 15 yr data set using Bayesian posterior predictive checks: after fitting our fiducial model to real data, we generate a population of simulated data-set replications, and use them to assess whether the optimal-statistic significance, inter-pulsar correlations, and spectral coefficients assume extreme values for the real data when compared to the replications. We confirm that the NANOGrav 15 yr data set is consistent with power-law and Hellings--Downs assumptions. We also evaluate the evidence for the stochastic background using posterior-predictive versions of the frequentist optimal statistic and of Bayesian model comparison, and find comparable significance (3.2\ $\sigma$ and 3\ $\sigma$ respectively) to what was previously reported for the standard statistics. We conclude with novel visualizations of the reconstructed gravitational waveforms that enter the residuals for each pulsar. Our analysis strengthens confidence in the identification and characterization of the gravitational-wave background as reported by NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Inspecting neutrino flavor instabilities during proto-neutron star cooling phase in supernova: I. Spherically symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard model of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), all neutrinos are assumed to be in pure flavor eigenstates in CCSN cores, but the assumption becomes invalid if neutrino distributions are unstable to flavor conversions. In this paper, we present a study of the occurrences of two representative neutrino-flavor instabilities, fast- and collisional flavor instabilities, in the cooling phase of proto-neutron star (PNS) from 1- to 50 seconds. We follow the long-term evolution of a PNS under spherically symmetric and quasi-static approximations, in which the matter profile is determined by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with neutrino feedback under the treatment of multi-group flux limited diffusion. For the stability analysis of neutrino flavor conversions, we recompute neutrino distributions using Monte Carlo transport in order to obtain the full angular distribution needed to compute the dispersion relations. We find no signs of flavor conversions in our models; the physical reason is thoroughly investigated. We also argue that the negative conclusion in flavor conversions could be changed qualitatively if multi-dimensional effects are included, as similar to cases in the earlier phase of CCSN.</description>

      <title>Supernova Polarization Signals From the Interaction with a Dense Circumstellar Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence that massive stars may exhibit an enhanced mass loss shortly before their termination explosion. Some of them also indicate the enhancement of their circumstellar matter (CSM) is not spherically symmetric. Supernova (SN) interacting with aspherical CSM could induce special polarization signals from multiple radiation components that deviate from spherical symmetry. We investigate the time-evolution of the continuum polarization induced by the SN ejecta interacting with a disk/torus-like CSM. Our calculation suggests that the interaction between the SN ejecta and an immediate disk-like CSM with a thin, homogenous density structure would produce a high continuum polarization, which may reach a peak level of $\sim$15\%. The interplay between the evolving geometry of the emitting regions and the time-variant flux ratio between the polar ejecta and the equatorial CSM interaction may produce a double-peaked feature in the polarization time sequence. A similar trend of the time evolution of the polarization is also found for a radially extended CSM disk that exhibits a wind-like density structure, with an overall relatively lower level of continuum polarization ($&lt;2.5\%$) during the interaction process. We also identify a non-uniform temperature distribution along the radial direction of the CSM disk, which yields a strong wavelength dependence of the continuum polarization. These signatures provide a unique geometric diagnostic to explore the interaction process and the associated extreme mass loss of the progenitors of interacting transients.</description>

      <title>Neutron star kicks plus rockets as a mechanism for forming wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent neutron star surface observations corroborate a long-standing theory that neutron stars may be accelerated over extended periods after their birth. We analyze how these prolonged rocket-like accelerations, combined with rapid birth kicks, impact binary orbits. We find that even a small contribution of rocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to reach period--eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary evolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel to form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well as inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar high-energy transients.</description>

      <title>Probing the Magnetised Gas Distribution in Galaxy Groups and the Cosmic Web with POSSUM Faraday Rotation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present initial results from the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), analysing 22,817 Faraday Rotation Measures (RMs) with median uncertainties of 1.2 rad m^-2 across 1,520 square degrees to study magnetised gas associated with 55 nearby galaxy groups (z less than 0.025) with halo masses between 10^12.5 and 10^14.0 M_sun. We identify two distinct gas phases: the Intragroup Medium (IGrM) within 0-2 splashback radii and the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) extending from 2 to 7 splashback radii. These phases enhance the standard deviation of residual (i.e., Galactic foreground RM-subtracted) RMs by 6.9 +/- 1.8 rad m^-2 and 4.2 +/- 1.2 rad m^-2, respectively. Estimated magnetic field strengths are several microGauss within the IGrM and 0.1-1 microGauss in the WHIM. We estimate the plasma beta in both phases and show that magnetic pressure might be more dynamically important than in the ICM of more massive clusters or sparse cosmic web filaments. Our findings indicate that "missing baryons" in the WHIM likely extend beyond the gravitational radii of group-mass halos to Mpc scales, consistent with large-scale, outflow-driven "magnetised bubbles" seen in cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that RM grids are an effective method for detecting magnetised thermal gas at galaxy group interfaces and within the cosmic web. This approach complements X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect methods, and when combined with Fast Radio Burst Dispersion Measures, data from the full POSSUM survey, comprising approximately a million RMs, will allow direct magnetic field measurements to further our understanding of baryon circulation in these environments and the magnetised universe.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the conformal limit inside rotating neutron stars: Implications to modified theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the supranuclear densities achieved inside a neutron star, matter may exhibit extreme properties. In particular, it may be the case that a suitable average of the speed of sound squared exceeds the so-called conformal limit, i.e., $\langle c_s^2 \rangle &gt; 1/3$, a condition that is equivalent to the positiveness of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor at the stellar center. This property, that holds for highly compact neutron stars obeying many (but not any) realistic equations of state, would turn these objects into interesting laboratories for tests of several scalar extensions of general relativity. In this paper, we investigate how rapid rotation influences the superconformality of the averaged speed of sound squared and modified gravity effects that depend thereupon, paying particular attention to scalar-tensor theories prone to the spontaneous scalarization effect.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electron Capture Supernova Candidate AT 2019abn with JWST Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new window to study highly reddened explosive transients. We present results from late-time (1421 days post-explosion) JWST follow-up spectroscopic observations with NIRSpec and MIRI LRS of the intermediate luminosity red transient (ILRT) AT 2019abn located in the nearby Messier 51 galaxy (8.6 Mpc). ILRTs represent a mysterious class of transients which exhibit peak luminosities between those of classical novae and supernovae and which are known to be highly dust obscured. Similar to the prototypical examples of this class of objects, NGC 300 2008-OT and SN 2008S, AT 2019abn has an extremely red and dusty progenitor detected only in pre-explosion Spitzer/IRAC imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 micron and not in deep optical or near-infrared HST images. We find that late time observations of AT 2019abn from NEOWISE and JWST are consistent with the late time evolution of SN 2008S. In part because they are so obscured by dust, it is unknown what produces an ILRT with hypotheses ranging from high mass stellar merger events, non-terminal stellar outbursts, or terminal supernovae explosions through electron-capture in super-AGB stars. Our JWST observations show strong mid-IR Class C PAH features at 6.3 and 8.25 micron typical of carbon-rich post-AGB sources. These features suggest the dust around AT 2019abn, either pre-existing or newly formed in the ejecta, is composed of carbonaceous grains which are not typically observed around red supergiants. However, depending on the strength and temperature of hot bottom burning, SAGBs may be expected to exhibit a carbon-rich chemistry. Thus our JWST observations are consistent with AT 2019abn having an SAGB progenitor.</description>

      <title>Neural Surrogate HMC: Accelerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with a Neural Network Surrogate Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo requires efficient computation of the likelihood function. In some scientific applications, the likelihood must be computed by numerically solving a partial differential equation, which can be prohibitively expensive. We demonstrate that some such problems can be made tractable by amortizing the computation with a surrogate likelihood function implemented by a neural network. We show that this has two additional benefits: reducing noise in the likelihood evaluations and providing fast gradient calculations. In experiments, the approach is applied to a model of heliospheric transport of galactic cosmic rays, where it enables efficient sampling from the posterior of latent parameters in the Parker equation.</description>

      <title>Ray Tracing Through Absorbing Dielectric Media in the Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity describes the trajectories of light-rays through curved spacetime near a massive object. In addition to gravitational lensing, we include an absorbing dielectric medium given by a complex refractive index known as the Drude model. When absorption is included the eikonal becomes complex, with the imaginary part related to the absorption along a ray between emission and observation points. We extend results from the literature to include dispersion in the index of refraction. The complex Hamiltonian splits into a real part that describes the equations of motion and a constraint equation that governs the momentum loss in the system. We work in coordinates which are fully real, with a real metric in physical spacetime. We assume the dust and plasma distributions of the Drude matter to coincide and vary as a power-law $1/r^h$. We find that transmission requires $h&gt;1$, otherwise exponential absorption occurs along ray paths. We use ray-tracing through strongly absorbing matter near the surface of the compact star, as well as specializing to a point-lens in the weak-field limit with weakly absorbing matter to generate potentially observable light curves for distant observers. In the appropriate limits, our theory reproduces results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Simulating Radio Synchrotron Morphology, Spectra, and Polarization of Cosmic Ray Driven Galactic Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of galaxies is significantly influenced by galactic winds, possibly driven by cosmic rays due to their long cooling times and better coupling to plasma compared to radiation. In this study, we compare the radio observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4217 from the CHANG-ES collaboration catalog with a mock observation of an isolated galaxy based on the arepo simulation that adopts the state-of-the-art two-moment cosmic ray transport treatment and multiphase interstellar medium model. We find significant agreement between the simulated and observed images and spectroscopic data. Specifically, we find that (i) while the radio flux is sensitive to the magnitude of the magnetic field, the shapes of intensity profiles are only weakly dependent on the normalization of the magnetic field and are robustly predicted by our galaxy simulations; (ii) the multi-wavelength spectrum above 0.1~GHz is in agreement with the radio observations and its slope is also only weakly sensitive to the magnetic field strength; (iii) the magnetic field direction exhibits an X-shaped morphology, often seen in edge-on galaxies, which is consistent with the observations and indicates the presence of a galactic-scale outflow. Since the normalization of the intensity profiles and spectrum are degenerate with respect to the magnetic field strength and the normalization of the electron spectrum, this qualitative match is possible provided that the simulated magnetic field is only mildly boosted, which could be attributed to the missing galactic disk interaction with the CGM in our idealized simulation. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating advanced cosmic ray transport models in simulations and provide a deeper understanding of galactic wind dynamics and its impact on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. A degeneracy between the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone is found for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

      <title>A first systematic characterization of cataclysmic variables in SRG/eROSITA surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) We present an account of known cataclysmic variables (CVs) that were detected as X-ray sources in eROSITA X-ray surveys and have Gaia DR3 counterparts. We address standard CVs with main sequence donors and white dwarfs accreting via Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) and related objects, the double degenerates (DDs), and the symbiotic stars (SySts). We discern between nonmagnetic (dwarf novae and nova-like objects) and magnetic CVs (polars and intermediate polars (IPs)). In the publically available eROSITA catalog from the recent DR1, typically 65\% of known cataloged and classified CVs are detected. This fraction rises to over 90\% if the stack of all \ero X-ray surveys (called S45 in this paper) is considered and the search volume is restricted to a radius of 500\,pc. We examine the various classes of CVs in various diagnostic diagrams relating X-ray and optical properties (luminosity, absolute magnitude, color, X-ray spectral hardness, and optical variability) and establish their average class properties. We derive spectral properties for the 22 brightest polars and confirm an increase in the ratio of soft to hard X-rays with increasing magnetic field in the accretion region. We report three new soft IPs and present a spectral analysis of all soft IPs. Their blackbody temperatures agree well with published values. The DDs represent the bluest and faintest subcategory but reach the same identification fraction as the standard CVs. The SySts are the most distant systems; only 20 (13\%) were detected as X-ray sources in S45, and 7 of those are first-time detections. We investigate their mean properties using an upper limit on the flux of the nondetected CVs. Their X-ray nondetection is indeed a distance effect.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations with BAM: Implementation and Code Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are among the most energetic events in our Universe, with magnetic fields significantly impacting their dynamics, particularly after the merger. While numerical-relativity simulations that correctly describe the physics are essential to model their rich phenomenology, the inclusion of magnetic fields is crucial for realistic simulations. For this reason, we have extended the BAM code to enable general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations employing a hyperbolic `divergence cleaning' scheme. We present a large set of standard GRMHD tests and compare the BAM code to other GRMHD codes, SPRITZ, GRaM-X, and SACRA$_{\rm KK22}$, which employ different schemes for the evolution of the magnetic fields. Overall, we find that the BAM code shows a good performance in simple special-relativistic tests. In addition, we find good agreement and consistent results when comparing GRMHD simulation results between BAM and SACRA$_{\rm KK22}$.</description>

      <title>Track signals at IceCube from subleading channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracks events at the IceCube Observatory are characterized by an energetic muon crossing several kilometers before decaying. Such muons are dominantly produced in charged current (CC) muon neutrino - hadron interactions. However, muons are also produced through the $W$ - boson production and in the decay of tau leptons and heavy mesons created in neutral and charged current interactions induced by all neutrino flavors. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of these subleading channels to events characterized as tracks at the IceCube. Our results indicate that these channels correspond to a non - negligible fraction of the HESE track events. In addition, we show that its contributions are concentrated in muons that are less energetic than those arising from muonic neutrino CC interactions for the same visible energies of the process. Finally, we investigate the impact of these additional channels on the description of the astrophysical neutrino flux, and we find that the inclusion of these subleading processes are important in determining the parameters of the astrophysical neutrino flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general method embedded in the ab initio nuclear framework to reconstruct linear response functions and calculate sum rules. Within our approach, based on the Gaussian integral transform, we consistently treat the groundstate and the excited spectrum. Crucially, the method allows for a robust uncertainty estimation of the spectral reconstruction. We showcase it for the spin response in neutron matter. Our calculations are performed using state-of-the-art many-body coupled-cluster method and Hamiltonians derived in the chiral effective field theory, emphasizing the analysis of finite-size effects. This work serves as a stepping stone towards further studies of neutrino interactions in astrophysical environments from first principles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a long thermonuclear X-ray burst from the ultra-compact binary 4U 1850$-$087</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of a long X-ray burst triggered on MJD 60171.65 from the ultra-compact binary 4U 1850$-$087 by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We analyse the NICER data observed in between MJD 60095.19$-$60177.43, including one observation covered part of the long X-ray burst tail, i.e., $0.15-3.8$ hr after the trigger. The persistent spectra are quite similar and well described by a combination of multi-color disk blackbody, with the inner temperature of 0.5 keV, and a thermally comptonized continuum with the asymptotic power-law photon index of $\Gamma\sim2.2$, and electron temperature of $kT_{\rm e}\sim20-30$ keV. The persistent fluxes were around $3.8\times10^{-10}~{\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a local accretion rate of $1\%~\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$. Part of time-resolved burst spectra show a clear deviation from the blackbody model, which can be improved by considering the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting-Robertson drag, or the reflected disk emission illuminated by the burst. From the burst flux during the cooling tail, we estimate the burst duration, $\tau \approx 0.78$ hr, the burst fluence, $E_\mathrm{b} \approx 4.1 \times 10^{41}$ ergs, and the ignition column depth, $y_{\rm ign}\approx 3.5\times10^{10}~{\rm g~cm^{-2}}$. We propose that the long X-ray burst is powered by unstable burning of pure helium in deep layer. Moreover, we identify significant 1 keV emission lines in the burst spectra, which may originate from the surrounding disk.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Reconstructed Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave High-Frequency Feature on the Nuclear Equation of State, in Real Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave (GW) predictions from five two-dimensional Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN) simulations that varied only in the Equation of State (EOS) implemented. The GW signals from these simulations are used to produce spectrograms in the absence of noise, and the emergent high-frequency feature (HFF) is found to differ quantitatively between simulations. Below 1 kHz, the HFF is well approximated by a first-order polynomial in time. The resulting slope was found to vary between 10-50% across all models. Further, using real interferometric noise we investigated the current capabilities of GW detectors to resolve these differences in HFF slope for a Galactic CCSN. We find that for distances up to 1 kpc, current detectors can resolve HFF slopes that vary by at least 30%. For further Galactic distances, current detectors are capable of distinguishing the upper and lower bounds of the HFF slope for groupings of our models that varied in EOS. With the higher sensitivity of future GW detectors, and with improved analysis of the HFF, our ability to resolve properties of the HFF will improve for all Galactic distances. This study shows the potential of using the HFF of CCSN produced GWs to provide insight into the physical processes occurring deep within CCSN during collapse, and in particular its potential to further constrain the EOS through GW detection.</description>

      <title>Whispering in the dark: Faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>

Abstract: This article presents the design of the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G) and discusses its scientific prospects. Using an array of radio sensors, RNO-G seeks to measure neutrinos above 10 PeV by exploiting the Askaryan effect in neutrino-induced cascades in ice. We discuss the experimental considerations that drive the design of RNO-G, present first measurements of the hardware that is to be deployed and discuss the projected sensitivity of the instrument. RNO-G will be the first production-scale radio detector for in-ice neutrino signals.</description>

      <title>The split majoron model confronts the NANOGrav signal and cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the light of the evidence of a gravitational wave background from the NANOGrav 15yr data set, we reconsider the split majoron model as a new physics extension of the standard model able to generate a needed contribution to solve the current tension between the data and the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole massive binaries. In the split majoron model the seesaw right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses from spontaneous symmetry breaking of global $U(1)_{B-L}$ in a strong first order phase transition of a complex scalar field occurring above the electroweak scale. The final vacuum expectation value couples to a second complex scalar field undergoing a low scale phase transition occurring after neutrino decoupling. Such a coupling enhances the strength of this second low scale first order phase transition and can generate a sizeable primordial gravitational wave background contributing to the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Some amount of extra-radiation is generated after neutron-to-proton ration freeze-out but prior to nucleosynthesis. This can be either made compatible with current upper bound from primordial deuterium measurements or even be used to solve a potential deuterium problem. Moreover, the free streaming length of light neutrinos can be suppressed by their interactions with the resulting majoron background and this mildly ameliorates existing cosmological tensions. Thus cosmological observations nicely provide independent motivations for the model.</description>

      <title>Collisions and collective flavor conversion: Integrating out the fast dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense astrophysical environments, notably core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, neutrino-neutrino forward scattering can spawn flavor conversion on very short scales. Scattering with the background medium can impact collective flavor conversion in various ways, either damping oscillations or possibly setting off novel collisional flavor instabilities (CFIs). A key feature in this process is the slowness of collisions compared to the much faster dynamics of neutrino-neutrino refraction. Assuming spatial homogeneity, we leverage this hierarchy of scales to simplify the description accounting only for the slow dynamics driven by collisions. We illustrate our new approach both in the case of CFIs and in the case of fast instabilities damped by collisions. In both cases, our strategy provides new equations, the slow-dynamics equations, that simplify the description of flavor conversion and allow us to qualitatively understand the final state of the system after the instability, either collisional or fast, has saturated.</description>

      <title>Are There Correlations in the HAWC and IceCube High Energy Skymaps Outside the Galactic Plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use publicly-available data to perform a search for correlations of high energy neutrino candidate events detected by IceCube and high-energy photons seen by the HAWC collaboration. Our search is focused on unveiling such correlations outside of the Galactic plane. This search is sensitive to correlations in the neutrino candidate and photon skymaps which would arise from a population of unidentified point sources. We find no evidence for such a correlation, but suggest strategies for improvements with new data sets.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Kinetic Equation for Mixed Neutrinos: Tracing the Missing Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flavor-dependent neutrino transport is described by a well-known kinetic equation for occupation-number matrices in flavor space. However, as an overlooked theoretical problem, we show that in the inhomogeneous case, neutrino-neutrino refractive energy is not conserved. We derive the missing gradient terms in the fast flavor limit (vanishing neutrino masses), and prove that the missing refractive energy is traded with the huge reservoir of neutrino kinetic energy through gradients of the weak interaction potential. Even small changes of the kinetic energy accommodate the refractive energy gained or lost. Flavor evolution alone is negligibly affected by the new terms.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Energy Extraction in Kerr Black Holes through Frame-Dragging Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is argued that the zero-angular-momentum-observers (ZAMOs) circulating with the frame-dragging-angular-velocity $\omega$ plays a leading part in energy extraction. When the condition $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is satisfied, where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ and $\Omega_{\rm F}$ are the horizon and field-line (FL) angular-velocities (AVs), they will see that the null surface S$_{\rm N}$ with $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$ always exists in the force-free magnetosphere. The pivotal ZAMO-measured FLAV $\Omega_{\rm ZF} \equiv \Omega_{\rm F} - \omega$ changes sign on this surface S$_{\rm N}$ where the force-free and freezing-in conditions break down. The force-free magnetosphere is divided on this surface, with particle-current sources on it. The outer domain ${D}_{\rm (out)}$ outside S$_{\rm N}$ spins forward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&gt;0$), whereas the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ inside spins backward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&lt;0$).
  Because the electric field ${\bf E}_{\rm p}$ reverses direction there, the Poynting flux reverses direction as well from outward to inward, though the positive angular momentum always flows outwardly.
  Electromagnetic self-extraction of energy will be possible only through the frame-dragged magnetosphere, with the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ nested between the horizon and the surface S$_{\rm N}$, when $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is ensured by the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlations between pulsars for interfering sources in Pulsar Timing Array and evidence for gravitational-wave background in NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>

      <title>Continued developments in X-ray speed reading: fast, low noise readout for next-generation wide-field imagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future strategic X-ray astronomy missions will require unprecedentedly sensitive wide-field imagers providing high frame rates, low readout noise and excellent soft energy response. To meet these needs, our team is employing a multi-pronged approach to advance several key areas of technology. Our first focus is on advanced readout electronics, specifically integrated electronics, where we are collaborating on the VERITAS readout chip for the Athena Wide Field Imager, and have developed the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC), which enables fast readout and high frame rates for MIT-LL JFET (junction field effect transistor) CCDs. Second, we are contributing to novel detector development, specifically the SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices fabricated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and their advanced readout, to achieve sub-electron noise performance. Hardware components set the stage for performance, but their efficient utilization relies on software and algorithms for signal and event processing. Our group is developing digital waveform filtering and AI methods to augment detector performance, including enhanced particle background screening and improved event characterization. All of these efforts make use of an efficient, new X-ray beamline facility at Stanford, where components and concepts can be tested and characterized.</description>
