      <title>Helical spin dynamics in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ as measured with small-angle neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulating chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ exhibits a rich array of low-temperature magnetic phenomena, making it a prime candidate for the study of its spin dynamics. Using spin wave small-angle neutron scattering (SWSANS), we systematically investigated the temperature-dependent behavior of the helimagnon excitations in the field-polarized phase of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Our measurements, spanning 5-55 K, reveal the temperature evolution of spin-wave stiffness and damping constant with unprecedented resolution, facilitated by the insulating nature of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. These findings align with theoretical predictions and resolve discrepancies observed in previous studies, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of the SWSANS method. The results provide deeper insights into the fundamental magnetic properties of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, contributing to a broader understanding of chiral magnets.</description>

      <title>Conformal Operator Flows of the Deconfined Quantum Criticality from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to $\mathrm{O}(4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), which separates two distinct symmetry-broken phases, was conjectured to be an example of (2+1)D criticality beyond the standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. However, this hypothesis has been met with challenges and remains elusive. Here, we perform a systematic study of a microscopic model realizing the DQCP with a global symmetry tunable from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to $\mathrm{O}(4)$. Through the lens of fuzzy sphere regularization, we uncover the key information on the renormalization group flow of conformal operators. We reveal O(4) primaries decomposed from original SO(5) primaries by tracing conformal operator content and identifying the ``avoided level crossing'' in the operator flows. In particular, we find that the existence of a scalar operator, in support of the nature of pseudo-criticality, remains relevant, persisting from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to $\mathrm{O}(4)$ DQCP. This work not only uncovers the nature of O(4) DQCP but also demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere scheme offers a unique perspective on the renormalization group flow of operators in the study of critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Kondo Insulator in a Multilayer Moire Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kondo insulators are a paradigmatic strongly correlated electron system, arising from the hybridization between itinerary conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments, which opens a gap in the band of conduction electrons. Traditionally, the known Kondo insulators are found in materials with f-electrons. Recent developments in two-dimensional (2D) moire systems provide a new approach to generate flat bands with strong electron correlation, which host localized moments at half filling. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of a Kondo insulator phase in a moire superlattice of monolayer WS2 / bilayer WSe2 which hosts a set of moire flat bands in the WSe2 layer interfacing the WS2 layer and dispersive bands in the other WSe2 layer. When both WSe2 layers are partially doped but with a total density of two holes per moire unit cell, an insulating state appears when the density of the moire band is below one hole per moire unit cell. The insulating state disappears above a certain threshold magnetic field and the system becomes metallic, which is a telltale signature of the Kondo insulator. The physics can be well explained by a periodic Anderson lattice model that includes both the on-site Coulomb repulsion in the moire flat band and the hybridization between moire flat and non-moire dispersive bands. Our results suggest that multilayer moire structures of transition metal dichalcogenides provide a tunable platform to simulate the Kondo insulator, which holds promise to tackle many critical open questions in the Kondo insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ground State and Spin Excitations in the 2D Trimerized Collinear-II Lattice Antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic ground state, spin excitations, and spin Hamiltonian of the 2D spin-1 trimerized Heisenberg antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14. Below the magnetic ordering temperature TN = 14.5 K, the compound exhibits a canted long-range antiferromagnetic order with a propagation vector k = (0 0 0), consistent with the magnetic space group P21/c.1 (No. 14.75). The ground state magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic spin-trimers of Ni2+ ions. The spin-trimers are coupled antiferromagnetically along the c-axis and ferromagnetically along the a-axis. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) reveals gapped and dispersive magnon excitations below the TN, and gapless quasi-elastic scatterings at higher temperature. The linear spin-wave theory simulations reveal the essential features of the excitation spectrum; by a spin Hamiltonian composed of ferromagnetic intra-trimer exchange interaction J1 and inter-trimer exchange interactions J2 (FM) and J3(AFM) within the bc plane. The J2 and J3 along the b-axis and c-axis, respectively, with strengths of J2/J1=0.79 and J3/J1=-0.91. In addition, a weak inter planer ferromagnetic exchange interaction J4 (|J4/J1|~0.12) is found along the a-axis. The determined exchange constants reveal a 2D trimerized Collinear-II spin lattice within the bc-plane. The analysis of INS spectra by linear spin-wave theory also yields a moderate single-ion anisotropy (D/J1=0.48) which accounts for the observed spin gap below TN as well as the metamagnetic transition near 44 kOe in dc magnetization (M vs H) curves. These findings identify Li2Ni3P4O14 as a rare realization of a two-dimensional trimerized spin system and offer the direct experimental confirmation of theoretically predicted magnon excitations, unveiling the fundamental characteristics of the expected excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Correlation-driven quantum geometry effects in a Kondo system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry, including quantum metric and Berry curvature, which describes the topology of electronic states, can induce fascinating physical properties. Symmetry-dependent nonlinear transport has emerged as a sensitive probe of these quantum geometric properties. However, its interplay with strong electronic correlations has rarely been explored in bulk materials, particularly in a Kondo lattice system. Here, we uncover correlation-driven quantum geometry in centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic iron telluride (FeTe). We experimentally observe the quantum metric quadrupole-induced third-order nonlinear transport, whose angular dependence reflects magnetic structure in FeTe. The nonlinear transport signals follow Kondo lattice crossover and vanish at high temperatures. Our theory suggests that a Kondo lattice formed at low temperatures explains the emergence of quantum geometry, which is induced by the opening of a hybridization gap near the Fermi energy. This discovery establishes a paradigm where quantum geometry arises not from static symmetry breaking but from dynamic many-body effects and provides a zero-field probe for sensing antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</description>

      <title>Pedagogical approach to anomalous position and velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a pedagogical method in deriving the expressions for anomalous position and velocity. While we follow the steps used in optics in the derivation of the group velocity, we use Bloch wave functions instead of plane wave states. In comparison to the plane wave case, application of Bloch wave functions results in two additional terms in the expression of the group velocity: the Berry phase factor and anomalous position contributions. These two new terms with distinct origins eventually lead to the known anomalous velocity. Aiming for an intuitive understanding, we simulate the situation under an electric field using linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital states and visually demonstrate that the envelope function exhibits the transverse motion expected from an anomalous velocity.</description>

      <title>Gauging Non-Invertible Symmetries in (2+1)d Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present practical and formal methods for gauging non-invertible symmetries in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. Along the way, we generalize various aspects of invertible 0-form gauging, including symmetry fractionalization, discrete torsion, and the fixed point theorem for symmetry action on lines. Our approach involves two complementary strands: the fusion of topological interfaces and Morita theory of fusion 2-categories. We use these methods to derive constraints on gaugeable symmetries and their duals while unifying the prescription for gauging non-invertible 0-form and 1-form symmetries and various higher structures. With a view toward recent advances in creating non-Abelian topological orders from Abelian ones, we give a simple recipe for non-invertible 0-form gauging that takes large classes of the latter to the former. We also describe conditions under which iterated gauging of invertible 0-form symmetries is equivalent to a single-step gauging of a non-invertible symmetry. We conclude with a set of concrete examples illustrating these various phenomena involving gauging symmetries of the infrared limit of the toric code.</description>

      <title>Mixed five-point correlators in the 3d Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study five-point correlators of the $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$ operators in the critical 3d Ising model. We consider the $\sigma \times \sigma$ and $\sigma \times \epsilon$ operator product expansions (OPEs) and truncate them by including a finite set of exchanged operators. We approximate the truncated operators by the corresponding contributions in appropriate disconnected five-point correlators. We compute a number of OPE coefficients that were previously unknown and show that these are consistent with predictions obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization of the critical 3d Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider BCS-like states in the 2D Hubbard model which, starting from some arbitrary point in field space in the neighborhood of a Hartree-Fock ground state, are relaxed within that BCS ansatz to local minima of the energy. As in the Hartree-Fock approximation there are a vast number of local minima. What is new, and unlike the conventional Hartree-Fock states, is that there is a region in parameter (coupling-density) space, where these local minima are associated with d-wave condensates.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.</description>

Abstract: We study the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma model with a bond-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which can be induced by an electric field applied in the third direction where the first and second directions refer to the two bond directions in the model. By a combination of field theory and symmetry analysis, an extended gapless phase with an emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry is found in the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma-DM chain. The analytic predictions are in good agreements with numerical results obtained from density matrix renormalization group simulations.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and wavefunction deformation of $D_4$ non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for R\'enyi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion rules.This opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetry Constrained Spin Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry and their spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that depends on the direction of the N\'eel ordering vector. The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the same symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible ferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values for other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for altermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general SOC-enabled quasi-symmetry, the uniaxial spin space-group, that provides a natural explanation for the amplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different altermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the magnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred N\'eel vector orientation for altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Applied-field magnetic structure and spectroscopy shifts of the effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, $XY$-like magnet Li$_2$CoCl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments undergo a spin-flop transition to a field-aligned ferromagnetic state above 1.6 T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and paramagnetic spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported in F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble/Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in 2D GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi surface topology and a metallic phase with non-quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the ground state of interacting quantum matter is a long-standing challenge, especially for complex two-dimensional systems. Recent developments have highlighted the potential of neural quantum states to solve the quantum many-body problem by encoding the many-body wavefunction into artificial neural networks. However, this method has faced the critical limitation that existing optimization algorithms are not suitable for training modern large-scale deep network architectures. Here, we introduce a minimum-step stochastic-reconfiguration optimization algorithm, which allows us to train deep neural quantum states with up to $10^6$ parameters. We demonstrate our method for paradigmatic frustrated spin-1/2 models on square and triangular lattices, for which our trained deep networks approach machine precision and yield improved variational energies compared to existing results. Equipped with our optimization algorithm, we find numerical evidence for gapless quantum-spin-liquid phases in the considered models, an open question to date. We present a method that captures the emergent complexity in quantum many-body problems through the expressive power of large-scale artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Improving the five-point bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the R\'enyi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.</description>

      <title>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Dirac charge in antiferromagnetic topological semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological node of electronic bands can carry emergent charge degree of freedom such as the Berry curvature monopole of the Weyl semimetals, which results in intriguing transport and optical phenomena. In this study, we discuss the existence of the hidden "Dirac charge" and its detection via the photocurrent response in antiferromagnetic (AFM) Dirac semimetals. In light of the Berry curvature defined in the spin and spin-charge-mixed parameter space, we identify Dirac charges as sources or sinks of the Berry curvature in the generalized parameter space. We demonstrate that this Dirac charge can be detected via the photocurrent driven by the spin-charge-coupled motive force. By using real-time simulation, we find that the Dirac charge plays a significant role in the photocurrent generation in AFM Dirac semimetals. This work reveals the hidden property of the Dirac points in AFM Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum -observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in a double quantum dot Josephson junction driven by electron-electron interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ a surrogate BCS model with discrete energy levels to investigate a hybrid system comprising two quantum dots (QD1 and QD2), where QD1 is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads. Through exact diagonalization of this system, we obtain numerically exact solutions that enable rigorous computation of key physical quantities. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring multiple controllable phase transitions mediated by quantum dot interactions. Specifically, the system first undergoes an initial phase transition when tuning QD2's interaction strength while maintaining QD1 in the non-interacting regime. Subsequent adjustment of QD1's interaction induces a secondary phase transition, followed by a third transition arising from inter-dot coupling modulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that parallel magnetic field application can drive reversible ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transitions under specific parameter conditions. Finally, we report the emergence of non-local magnetization phenomena when subjecting QD1 to weak magnetic fields. And our results demonstrate that the orientation of nonlocal magnetization can be precisely manipulated through systematic adjustment of the on-site interaction strength $U_2$ in QD2.</description>
