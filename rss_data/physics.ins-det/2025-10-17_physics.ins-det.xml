      <title>Nanodiamond photocathodes for MPGD-based single photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the suitability of Hydrogenated NanoDiamond (HND) materials as an alternative for CsI in MPGD-based photon detectors. The research focuses on characterizing HND photocathodes coupled with THGEM + Micromegas-based detectors. The HND grains were prepared via hydrogenation and stored in water for more than two years. They were then coated on PCB discs or THGEMs using a pulsed spray technique. The resulting quantum efficiency (QE) values (~4% at 122 nm) were found to be within a factor of 10 of the best freshly hydrogenated samples reported in the literature ( ~40% at 120 nm). The robustness of reflective HND photocathodes against ion bombardment was measured to be about 10 times larger than the corresponding CsI one after the same charge accumulation. Furthermore, THGEM characterization indicates minimal alteration in response after HND coatings. These results suggest that HND holds potential as a more robust photocathode for gaseous detectors, offering improved performance in single-photon detection applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating plastic scintillator performance as a substitute of LYSO in SiPM based animal PET scanners: A GEANT4 simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study is conducted to understand the coincident resolving time (CRT) for a pair of Lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) and the plastic scintillation detector bars under the Geant4 framework. Crystals are coupled to a silicon photomultiplier single pad wafer with an appropriate optical coupling for signal readout. Pad reads the light photons undergoing optoelectronic conversion at the wafer site and generates electrical pulses with a bi-exponential shape. These signals are used to determine the trigger time stamp of back-to-back gamma-rays emitted from a point source, enabling the evaluation of CRT performance at different plastic scintillator lengths. For the LYSO detector, the simulation yields the CRT response of 174 ps, which aligns to the literature reported value for the dimensions 2 mm x 2 mm x 10 mm. To identify the plastic scintillator dimensions with an integrated gamma-ray detection efficiency comparable to LYSO's photopeak efficiency at 511 keV gamma photons, various bar lengths of commercial plastic BC404 and TIFR Ooty's in-house developed plastic material are attempted in Geant4. Consequently, for both the plastic scintillators, the equivalent length (for the same cross-sectional area) was found to be 4 times that of LYSO crystal length at a threshold of 25 keV. CRT value determined for this dimension is found to be $\approx$ 300 ps for both the plastic medium. It suggests that, if an animal preclinical PET scanner is developed with plastic bars, the minimum achievable image resolution (FWHM) of $\approx$ 4.5 cm can be expected for a pair of detection elements.</description>

      <title>Design and simulation of a 4H-SiC low gain avalanche diode with trench-isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and simulation of a 30 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) optimized for high-voltage operation. A 2.4 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick epitaxially grown gain layer enables controlled internal amplification up to 1 kV reverse bias, while maintaining full depletion below 500 V. Electrical characteristics, including I-V, C-V, and gain behavior, were simulated in Synopsys Sentaurus Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) using a quasi-1D geometry and verified across process-related variations in gain layer parameters. To ensure high-voltage stability and proper edge termination, a guard structure combining deep etched trenches and deep $p^+$ junction termination extension (JTE) implants was designed. TCAD simulations varying the guard structure dimensions yielded an optimized design with a breakdown voltage above 2.4 kV. A corresponding wafer run is currently processed at IMB-CNM, Barcelona.</description>

      <title>Design optimization of silicon nitride nanomechanical resonators for thermal infrared detectors: a guide through key figures of merit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.</description>

      <title>Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.</description>

      <title>Scintillating properties of Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ crystals in the temperature range of 5-300 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new comprehensive study on the Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ (CZC) crystal scintillating properties under different types of irradiation was performed over a wide temperature range from 5 to 300 K. The light yield (LY) at room temperature (RT), measured under irradiation by 662 keV $\gamma$ quanta of $^{137}$Cs, was evaluated to be 53,300 $\pm$ 4,700 photons/MeV corresponding to approximately 71% of its estimated absolute value. The maximum light emission was observed in the temperature interval 135-165 K, where the LY reached 56,900 photons/MeV and 19,700 photons/MeV for $\gamma$ quanta and $\alpha$ particles, respectively. The quenching factor (QF) for $\alpha$ particles increases smoothly from QF = 0.30 at RT to QF = 0.36 at 135 K. The shape of scintillation pulses induced by $\alpha$ particles is characterized by three time-constants (0.3, 2.5 and 11.8 $\mu$s at RT), whereas the average pulse of $\gamma$ induced events is characterized by two time-constants (1.3 and 11.5 $\mu$s at RT). At the same time, scintillating properties and pulse-shape discrimination capability of the CZC exhibit an acute deterioration at temperatures below 135 K. The optimal operating conditions to maximize the scintillating performance of undoped CZC crystals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\pm$90$^{\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\sim$200 MBq to $\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\theta_{1,2}\in[72^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\Delta\phi=90^{\circ}\pm20^{\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\mu$, gaining $\sim$50\% in value during the experiment.</description>
