      <title>Structural and Superconducting Properties in the Te-doped Spinel CuRh2Se4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the impact of tellurium (Te) doping on the spinel superconductor CuRh2Se4. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the structural and superconducting properties of the system using various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. Based on our XRD analysis, we found that the spinel superconductor CuRh2Se4-xTex crystallizes in the space group Fd3m(227) with x in the region of 0 to 0.28, while the layered compound CuRh2Se4-xTex crystallizes in the space group P3m1 (164) with x in the region of 2.8 to 4.0. The upper critical magnetic field can be increased from 0.95(2) T for CuRh2Se4 to 3.44(1) T for CuRh2Se3.72Te0.28 by doping with elemental Te. However, the layered compound CuRh2Se4-xTex did not exhibit superconducting properties. Besides, the specific heat measurements of CuRh2Se4-xTex (x = 0, 0.1, 0.28) indicate that the Te element doping affects the electronic structure and interactions of the material and breaks the stability of the superconducting pairing, which leads to a decrease in the Tc. Finally, we show the electronic phase diagram of Tc with Te doping to summarise our findings.</description>

      <title>Diluted Yu-Shiba-Rusinov arrays on the $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd anisotropic superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic adatoms on s-wave superconductors induce bound states inside the superconducting gap, called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states (YSR). The anisotropy of the Fermi surface determines the spatial extension of bound states in a quasi-two-dimensional superconductor. This is especially important in the diluted impurity limit since the orbital overlap determines the coupling of YSR states of neighboring atoms and the formation of the collective YSR system. Here, we build diluted arrays of Mn atoms with different dimensionalities on the surface of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, and we measure the evolution of their YSR spectra with the structure. We detect the coupling as a split of YSR peaks in subgap spectra and find that the split size increases with the number of atoms. The orientation of the structures along different directions of the \bipd substrate modulates the split and particle-hole asymmetry of the YSR states due to the anisotropic character of the Fermi surface, captured by the Green function model. With the aid of the model, we found multiple YSR excitations in an extended 2D array of 25 Mn atoms, and we identified that their spatial distribution reflects a chiral LDOS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lecture notes used as part of a graduate-level Introduction to Solid State Physics course at Cornell University. I attempt to unify and update the discussion of magnetism and superconductivity relative to standard textbook treatments, and include connections to recent research. A few related homework problems are attached at the end.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional bond-order formation in kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K) analyzed by the density-wave equation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models for kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. In the DW equation analysis, the most favorable 3D structure is (i) the alternating vertical stacking BO, where star-of-David (SoD) and tri-hexagonal (TrH) patterns stack alternatively. Other candidate is (ii) the shift-stacking BO composed of either SoD or TrH pattern. We find that the 3D structure of BO can be determined by the 3rd-order Ginzburg-Landau free energy $b\phi_1\phi_2\phi_3$. Since $b$ depends sensitively on the band structure, both (i) and (ii) can be realized. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Nodal higher-order topological superconductivity from C6-symmetric Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional hinge modes which are termed the higher-order hinge Fermi-arc (HOFA) states. They are the topological consequences of Dirac points. Superconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to form nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there exists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs. In this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs respecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We find that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac superconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order Majorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing between the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate that HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points by utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).</description>
