      <title>Delay Optimization in a Simple Offloading System: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a computation offloading system where jobs are processed sequentially at a local server followed by a higher-capacity cloud server. The system offers two service modes, differing in how the processing is split between the servers. Our goal is to design an optimal policy for assigning jobs to service modes and partitioning server resources in order to minimize delay. We begin by characterizing the system's stability region and establishing design principles for service modes that maximize throughput. For any given job assignment strategy, we derive the optimal resource partitioning and present a closed-form expression for the resulting delay. Moreover, we establish that the delay-optimal assignment policy exhibits a distinct breakaway structure: at low system loads, it is optimal to route all jobs through a single service mode, whereas beyond a critical load threshold, jobs must be assigned across both modes. We conclude by validating these theoretical insights through numerical evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Convex Obstacle Avoidance Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires reliable collision avoidance in dynamic environments. Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (NMPCs) are suitable for this task, but struggle in time-critical scenarios requiring high frequency. To meet this demand, optimization problems are often simplified via linearization, narrowing the horizon window, or reduced temporal nodes, each compromising accuracy or reliability. This work presents the first general convex obstacle avoidance formulation, enabled by a novel approach to integrating logic. This facilitates the incorporation of an obstacle avoidance formulation into convex MPC schemes, enabling a convex optimization framework with substantially improved computational efficiency relative to conventional nonconvex methods. A key property of the formulation is that obstacle avoidance remains effective even when obstacles lie outside the prediction horizon, allowing shorter horizons for real-time deployment. In scenarios where nonconvex formulations are unavoidable, the proposed method meets or exceeds the performance of representative nonconvex alternatives. The method is evaluated in autonomous vehicle applications, where system dynamics are highly nonlinear.</description>

      <title>Safe Online Control-Informed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Safe Online Control-Informed Learning framework for safety-critical autonomous systems. The framework unifies optimal control, parameter estimation, and safety constraints into an online learning process. It employs an extended Kalman filter to incrementally update system parameters in real time, enabling robust and data-efficient adaptation under uncertainty. A softplus barrier function enforces constraint satisfaction during learning and control while eliminating the dependence on high-quality initial guesses. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence and safety guarantees, and the framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on cart-pole and robot-arm systems.</description>

      <title>A Fair, Flexible, Zero-Waste Digital Electricity Market: A First-Principles Approach Combining Automatic Market Making, Holarchic Architectures and Shapley Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13871v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics.
  Existing energy only, capacity augmented, and zonal market designs are shown to admit no shock robust Nash equilibrium under realistic uncertainty, instead relying on price caps, uplift, and regulatory intervention to preserve solvency and security. In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes.
  The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule.
  Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage. Fuel costs are recovered through pay as bid energy dispatch consistent with merit order, while non fuel operating and capital costs are allocated according to adequacy, flexibility, and locational contribution.
  Large scale simulations demonstrate bounded input bounded output stability, controllable procurement costs, zero structural waste, and improved distributional outcomes. The architecture is climate aligned and policy configurable, but requires a managed transition and new operational tools for system operators and market participants.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Control via Conditional Mean Embeddings: Formal Guarantees via Uncertain MDP Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling stochastic systems with unknown dynamics and under complex specifications is specially challenging in safety-critical settings, where performance guarantees are essential. We propose a data-driven policy synthesis framework that yields formal performance guarantees for such systems using conditional mean embeddings (CMEs) and uncertain Markov decision processes (UMDPs). From trajectory data, we learn the system's transition kernel as a CME, then construct a finite-state UMDP abstraction whose transition uncertainties capture learning and discretization errors. Next, we generate a policy with formal performance bounds through robust dynamic programming. We demonstrate and empirically validate our method through a temperature regulation benchmark.</description>

      <title>Fast Frequency Response Potential of Data Centers through Workload Modulation and UPS Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced system inertia and increased the need for fast frequency response (FFR) in modern power systems. Data centers, as large and flexible electrical consumers, hold great potential to contribute to frequency stabilization due to their controllable IT workloads and on-site uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging data centers for providing fast frequency response through real-time workload modulation and UPS coordination. A dynamic model combining data center power consumption and grid frequency dynamics is developed, capturing the interactions between IT servers, cooling systems, and energy storage. Control strategies based on frequency deviation are implemented to adjust server power and discharge UPS batteries during frequency events. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce frequency nadir and shorten recovery time without compromising service quality. The results highlight the promising role of data centers as grid-supporting resources in future low-inertia systems.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Fast Frequency Response from Electric Vehicles, Data Centers, and Battery Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High renewable penetration has significantly reduced system inertia in modern power grids, increasing the need for fast frequency response (FFR) from distributed and non-traditional resources. While electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) have each demonstrated the capability to provide sub-second active power support, their combined frequency response potential has not been systematically evaluated. This paper proposes a coordinated control framework that aggregates these heterogeneous resources to provide fast, stable, and reliable FFR. Dynamic models for EV fleets, data center UPS and workload modulation, and BESS are developed, explicitly capturing their response times, power limits, and operational constraints. A hierarchical control architecture is introduced, where an upper-level coordinator dynamically allocates FFR among resources based on response speed and available capacity, and lower-level controllers implement the actual power response. Case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the coordinated EV-DC-BESS framework improves frequency nadir by up to 0.2 Hz, reduces RoCoF, and accelerates frequency recovery compared with single-resource FFR. Results confirm that synergistic coordination significantly enhances grid stability, especially in low-inertia scenarios. This work highlights the value of multi-resource aggregation for future frequency regulation markets in renewable-dominated grids.</description>

      <title>KalMRACO: Unifying Kalman Filter and Model Reference Adaptive Control for Robust Control and Estimation of Uncertain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common assumption when applying the Kalman filter is a priori knowledge of the system parameters. These parameters are not necessarily known, and this may limit real-world applications of the Kalman filter. The well-established Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) utilizes a known reference model and ensures that the input-output behavior of a potentially unknown system converges to that of the reference model. We present KalMRACO, a unification of the Kalman filter and MRAC leveraging the reference model of MRAC as the Kalman filter system model, thus eliminating, to a large degree, the need for knowledge of the underlying system parameters in the application of the Kalman filter. We also introduce the concept of blending estimated states and measurements in the feedback law to handle stability issues during the initial transient. KalMRACO is validated through simulations and lab trials on an underwater vehicle. Results show superior tracking of the reference model state, observer state convergence, and noise mitigation properties.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Electric Vehicle Powertrain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrification in the automotive industry and increasing powertrain complexity demand accelerated, cost-effective development cycles. While data-driven models are recently investigated at component level, a gap exists in systematically integrating them into cohesive, system-level simulations for virtual validation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a modular framework for developing powertrain simulations. By defining standardized interfaces for key components-the battery, inverter, and electric motor-our methodology enables independently developed models, whether data-driven, physics-based, or empirical, to be easily integrated. This approach facilitates scalable system-level modeling, aims to shorten development timelines and to meet the agile demands of the modern automotive industry.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Task-Space Port-Hamiltonian Formulation for Redundant Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel geometric port-Hamiltonian formulation of redundant manipulators performing a differential kinematic task $\eta=J(q)\dot{q}$, where $q$ is a point on the configuration manifold, $\eta$ is a velocity-like task space variable, and $J(q)$ is a linear map representing the task, for example the classical analytic or geometric manipulator Jacobian matrix. The proposed model emerges from a change of coordinates from canonical Hamiltonian dynamics, and splits the standard Hamiltonian momentum variable into a task-space momentum variable and a null-space momentum variable. Properties of this model and relation to Lagrangian formulations present in the literature are highlighted. Finally, we apply the proposed model in an \textit{Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control} (IDA-PBC) design to stabilize and shape the impedance of a 7-DOF Emika Panda robot in simulation.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Filter Cascade for Relative Attitude, Target's Angular Velocity, and Gyroscope Bias Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rendezvous and docking between a chaser spacecraft and an uncooperative target, such as an inoperative satellite, require synchronization between the chaser spacecraft and the target. In these scenarios, the chaser must estimate the relative attitude and angular velocity of the target using onboard sensors, in the presence of gyroscope bias. In this work, we propose a cascade of Equivariant Filters (EqF) to address this problem. The first stage of the cascade estimates the chaser's attitude and the bias, using measurements from a star tracker, while the second stage of the cascade estimates the relative attitude and the target's angular velocity, using observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. The stability of the EqF cascade is theoretically analyzed and simulation results demonstrate the filter cascade's performance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear System Identification Nano-drone Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for system identification based on 75k real-world samples from the Crazyflie 2.1 Brushless nano-quadrotor, a sub-50g aerial vehicle widely adopted in robotics research. The platform presents a challenging testbed due to its multi-input, multi-output nature, open-loop instability, and nonlinear dynamics under agile maneuvers. The dataset comprises four aggressive trajectories with synchronized 4-dimensional motor inputs and 13-dimensional output measurements. To enable fair comparison of identification methods, the benchmark includes a suite of multi-horizon prediction metrics for evaluating both one-step and multi-step error propagation. In addition to the data, we provide a detailed description of the platform and experimental setup, as well as baseline models highlighting the challenge of accurate prediction under real-world noise and actuation nonlinearities. All data, scripts, and reference implementations are released as open-source at https://github.com/idsia-robotics/nanodrone-sysid-benchmark to facilitate transparent comparison of algorithms and support research on agile, miniaturized aerial robotics.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Observer for Bearing Estimation with Linear and Angular Velocity Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of designing an equivariant observer for a first order dynamical system on the unit-sphere. Building upon the established case of unit bearing vector dynamics with angular velocity inputs, we introduce an additional linear velocity input projected onto the unit-sphere tangent space. This extended formulation is particularly useful in image-based visual servoing scenarios where stable bearing estimates are required and the relative velocity between the vehicle and target features must be accounted for. Leveraging lifted kinematics to the Special Orthogonal group, we design an observer for the bearing vector and prove its almost global asymptotic stability. Additionally, we demonstrate how the equivariant observer can be expressed in the original state manifold. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Consistent, Causal Data-Driven Predictive Control via SSARX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental-lemma-free data-driven predictive control (DDPC) scheme for synthesizing model predictive control (MPC)-like policies directly from input-output data. Unlike the well-known DeePC approach and other DDPC methods that rely on Willems' fundamental lemma, our method avoids stacked Hankel representations and the DeePC decision variable g. Instead, we develop a closed-loop consistent, causal DDPC scheme based on the multi-step predictor Subspace-ARX (SSARX). The method first (i) estimates predictor/observer Markov parameters via a high-order ARX model to decouple the noise, then (ii) learns a multi-step past-to-future map by regression, optionally with a reduced-rank constraint. The SSARX predictor is strictly causal, which allows it to be integrated naturally into an MPC formulation. Our experimental results show that SSARX performs competitively with other methods when applied to closed-loop data affected by measurement and process noise.</description>

      <title>Scalable Nonlinear DeePC: Bridging Direct and Indirect Methods and Basis Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) within a nonlinear framework and its relationship to subspace predictive control (SPC). The $\Pi$-regularization is extended to general basis functions and it is shown that, under suitable conditions, the resulting basis functions DeePC formulation constitutes a relaxation of basis functions SPC. To improve scalability, we introduce an SVD-based dimensionality reduction that preserves the equivalence with SPC, and we derive a reduced {\Pi}-regularization. A LASSO based sparse basis selection method is proposed to obtain a reduced basis from lifted data. Simulations on a nonlinear van der Pol oscillator model indicate that, in the absence of noise, DeePC and SPC yield equivalent absolute mean tracking errors (AMEs) when large penalties are applied. In contrast, under noisy measurements, careful tuning of the DeePC regularization results in a reduced AME, outperforming SPC.</description>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern applications demands wireless networks capable of real time adaptability and efficient resource management. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography</title>

Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</description>

      <title>Group-Theoretic Reinforcement Learning of Dynamical Decoupling Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling seeks to mitigate phase decoherence in qubits by applying a carefully designed sequence of effectively instantaneous electromagnetic pulses. Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Tracking for Multi-Manipulator Systems in Constrained Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of cooperative manipulation by a mobile multi-manipulator system operating in obstacle-cluttered and highly constrained environments under spatio-temporal task specifications. The task requires transporting a grasped object while respecting both continuous robot dynamics and discrete geometric constraints arising from obstacles and narrow passages. To address this hybrid structure, we propose a multi-rate planning and control framework that combines offline generation of an STL-satisfying object trajectory and collision-free base footprints with online constrained inverse kinematics and continuous-time feedback control. The resulting closed-loop system enables coordinated reconfiguration of multiple manipulators while tracking the desired object motion. The approach is evaluated in high-fidelity physics simulations using three Franka Emika Panda mobile manipulators rigidly grasping an object.</description>

      <title>LegionITS: A Federated Intrusion-Tolerant System Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing sophistication, frequency, and diversity of cyberattacks increasingly exceed the capacity of individual entities to fully understand and counter them. While existing solutions, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms, and Security Operation Center (SOC), play a vital role in mitigating known threats, they often struggle to effectively address emerging and unforeseen attacks. To increase the effectiveness of cyber defense, it is essential to foster greater information sharing between entities; however, this requires addressing the challenge of exchanging sensitive data without compromising confidentiality or operational security.
  To address the challenges of secure and confidential Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing, we propose a novel architecture that federates Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) and leverages concepts from Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) to empower SOCs. This framework enables controlled collaboration and data privacy while enhancing collective defenses. As a proof of concept, we evaluate one module by applying Differential Privacy (DP) to Federated Learning (FL), observing a manageable accuracy drop from 98.42% to 85.98% (average loss 12.44%) while maintaining reliable detection of compromised messages. These results highlight the viability of secure data sharing and establishes a foundation for the future full-scale implementation of LegionITS.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reaction Rate Constants from Impedance Spectra: Simulating the Multistep Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.</description>

      <title>Temporal interference stimulation for deep brain neuromodulation in humans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades, focal non-invasive neuromodulation of deep brain regions has not been possible because of the steep depth-focality trade-off of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or classical transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Deep brain stimulation has therefore largely relied on invasive approaches in clinical populations, requiring surgery. Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a promising method to overcome this challenge and allows for the first time focal non-invasive electrical deep brain stimulation. The method, which was first validated through computational modeling and rodent work, has now been successfully translated to humans to target deep brain regions such as the hippocampus or striatum. In this Perspective, we present current evidence for tTIS-based neuromodulation, underlying mechanisms and discuss future developments of this promising technology. More specifically, we highlight key opportunities and challenges for fundamental neuroscience as well as for the design of new interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the status of understanding and challenges regarding the basic mechanisms of action of tTIS and possible lines of technological innovation to optimize stimulation, in particular in terms of intensity and focality. Overall, we suggest that following the first proof-of-concepts, an important multidisciplinary research effort is now required to further validate the use of tTIS in multiple applications, understand its underlying principles and optimize the technology in the view of a wider scientific and clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>The Innovation Null Space of the Kalman Predictor: A Stochastic Perspective for DeePC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma uses a key decision variable $g$ to combine measured input-output data and describe trajectories of a linear time-invariant system. In this paper, we ask: what is a good choice for this vector $g$ when the system is affected by noise? For a linear system with Gaussian noise, we show that there exists an optimal subspace for this decision variable $g$, which is the null space of the innovation Hankel matrix. If the decision vector lies in this null space, the resulting predictor gets closer to the Kalman predictor. To show this, we use a result that we refer to as the Kalman Filter Fundamental Lemma (KFFL), which applies Willems' lemma to the Kalman predictor. This viewpoint also explains several existing data-driven predictive control methods: regularized DeePC schemes act as soft versions of the innovation null-space constraint, instrumental-variable methods enforce it by construction, and ARX-based approaches explicitly estimate this innovation null space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\Delta$ are provided. Available on GitHub at https://github.com/gridfm/gridfm-datakit under Apache 2.0 and via `pip install gridfm-datakit`.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Orbital Debris Remediation with Reconfigurable Space-Based Laser Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital debris poses an escalating threat to space missions and the long-term sustainability of Earth's orbital environment. The literature proposes various approaches for orbital debris remediation, including the use of multiple space-based lasers that collaboratively engage debris targets. While the proof of concept for this laser-based approach has been demonstrated, critical questions remain about its scalability and responsiveness as the debris population continues to expand rapidly. This paper introduces constellation reconfiguration as a system-level strategy to address these limitations. Through coordinated orbital maneuvers, laser-equipped satellites can dynamically adapt their positions to respond to evolving debris distributions and time-critical events. We formalize this concept as the Reconfigurable Laser-to-Debris Engagement Scheduling Problem (R-L2D-ESP), an optimization framework that determines the optimal sequence of constellation reconfigurations and laser engagements to maximize debris remediation capacity, which quantifies the constellation's ability to nudge, deorbit, or perform just-in-time collision avoidance maneuvers on debris objects. To manage the complexity of this combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a receding horizon approach. Our experiments reveal that reconfigurable constellations significantly outperform static ones, achieving greater debris remediation capacity and successfully deorbiting substantially more debris objects. Additionally, our sensitivity analyses identify the key parameters that influence remediation performance the most, providing essential insights for future system design. These findings demonstrate that constellation reconfiguration represents a promising advancement for laser-based debris removal systems, offering the adaptability and scalability necessary to enhance this particular approach to orbital debris remediation.</description>

Abstract: Satellites are becoming exceedingly critical for communication, making them prime targets for cyber-physical attacks. We consider a rogue satellite in low Earth orbit that jams the uplink communication between another satellite and a ground station. To achieve maximal interference with minimal fuel consumption, the jammer carefully maneuvers itself relative to the target satellite's antenna. We cast this maneuvering objective as a two-stage optimal control problem, involving i) repositioning to an efficient jamming position before uplink communication commences; and ii) maintaining an efficient jamming position after communication has started. We obtain the optimal maneuvering trajectories for the jammer and perform simulations to show how they enable the disruption of uplink communication with reasonable fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Implementations of Various Generalizations of Balanced Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist two main approaches for non-intrusive implementations of approximate balanced truncation within the Loewner framework: the quadrature-based method [1] and the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI)-based method [2]. Both approaches rely solely on samples of the transfer function to construct truncated balanced models, eliminating the need for access to the original model's statespace realization. Recently, the quadrature-based approach has been extended to various generalizations of balanced truncation, including positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real balanced truncation, and balanced stochastic truncation. While this extension [3] is theoretically non-intrusive-meaning it does not require the original state-space realization-it depends on samples of spectral factorizations of the transfer function. Since practical methods for obtaining such samples are currently unavailable, this extension remains largely a theoretical contribution. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ADI-type framework for these generalized balanced truncation methods that requires only samples of the original transfer function for implementation.</description>

      <title>Standards-Compliant DM-RS Allocation via Temporal Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS), which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.</description>

      <title>The Phantom of Davis-Wielandt Shell: A Unified Framework for Graphical Stability Analysis of MIMO LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell for graphical stability analysis of multi-input and multi-output linear time-invariant feedback systems. Connections between DW shells and various graphical representations, as well as gain and phase measures, are established through an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we map the relationships and relative conservatism among various separation conditions. A rotated scaled relative graph ($\theta$-SRG) concept is proposed as a mixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion is derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D graphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops. We also propose a reliable and generalizable algorithm for visualizing the $\theta$-SRGs and include a system example to demonstrate the reduced conservatism of the proposed condition.</description>

      <title>Data-fused MPC with Guarantees: Application to Flying Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Data-Fused Model Predictive Control (DFMPC) framework that combines physics-based models with data-driven representations of unknown dynamics. Leveraging Willems' Fundamental Lemma and an artificial equilibrium formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Pursuits in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cislunar space is becoming a critical domain for future lunar and interplanetary missions, yet its remoteness, sparse infrastructure, and unstable dynamics create single points of failure. Adversaries in cislunar orbits can exploit these vulnerabilities to pursue and jam co-located communication relays, potentially severing communications between lunar missions and the Earth. We study a pursuit-evasion scenario between two spacecraft in a cislunar orbit, where the evader must avoid a pursuer-jammer while remaining close to its nominal trajectory. We model the evader-pursuer interaction as a zero-sum adversarial differential game cast in the circular restricted three-body problem. This formulation incorporates critical aspects of cislunar orbital dynamics, including autonomous adjustment of the reference orbit phasing to enable aggressive evading maneuvers, and shaping of the evader's cost with the orbit's stable and unstable manifolds. We solve the resulting nonlinear game locally using a continuous-time differential dynamic programming variant, which iteratively applies linear-quadratic approximations to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. We simulate the evader's behavior against both a worst-case and a linear-quadratic pursuer. Our results pave the way for securing future missions in cislunar space against emerging cyber threats.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust and Correct Controllers Guided by Feasibility-Aware Signal Temporal Logic via BarrierNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enforcing safety in optimization-based controllers, and their integration with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has enabled the specification-driven synthesis of complex robotic behaviors. However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and myopic, per-time step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that embeds trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) into a differentiable Quadratic Program (dQP). Our approach provides a systematic procedure for constructing time-varying HOCBF constraints for a broad fragment of STL and introduces a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, QP feasibility, and control-bound compliance. Three neural networks-InitNet, RefNet, and an extended BarrierNet-collaborate to generate reference inputs and adapt constraint-related hyperparameters automatically over time and across initial conditions, reducing conservativeness while maximizing robustness. The resulting controller achieves STL satisfaction with strictly feasible dQPs and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Competent Discrete Time Modeling For analogue controlled PWM Converter Considering State-Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since R.D.Middlebrook proposed the state space averaging notion. The small signal model has been widely used as a design tool to tune control parameters. As Moore's law is continuing and the AI chip's high demand for power consumption and dynamic response, the control bandwidth needs to be boosted. However, the average model has two basic assumptions: the low-frequency assumption, the small ripple assumption. In high-bandwidth design, these two assumptions are violated. In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result 4.generality.</description>

      <title>Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Building Energy Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The building sector is one of the largest contributors to global energy consumption. Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop: Motion Prediction Models beyond Open-Loop Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fueled by motion prediction competitions and benchmarks, recent years have seen the emergence of increasingly large learning based prediction models, many with millions of parameters, focused on improving open-loop prediction accuracy by mere centimeters. However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore, we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even superior closed-loop driving performance.

      <title>A constrained optimization approach to nonlinear system identification through simulation error minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to system identification for nonlinear input-output models that minimizes the simulation error and frames the problem as a constrained optimization task. The proposed method addresses vanishing gradient issues, enabling faster convergence than traditional gradient-based techniques. We present an algorithm based on feedback linearization control of Lagrange multipliers and conduct a theoretical analysis of its performance. We prove that the algorithm converges to a local minimum, and it enhances computational efficiency by exploiting the problem's structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms gradient-based methods in both computational effort and estimation accuracy.</description>
