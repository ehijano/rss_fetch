      <title>A Macroscopically Consistent Reactive Langevin Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion (PBSRD) models are a popular approach for capturing stochasticity in reaction and transport processes across biological systems. In some contexts, the overdamped approximation inherent in such models may be inappropriate, necessitating the use of more microscopic Langevin Dynamics models for spatial transport. In this work we develop a novel particle-based Reactive Langevin Dynamics (RLD) model, with a focus on deriving reactive interaction kernels that are consistent with the physical constraint of detailed balance of reactive fluxes at equilibrium. We demonstrate that, to leading order, the overdamped limit of the resulting RLD model corresponds to the volume reactivity PBSRD model, of which the well-known Doi model is a particular instance. Our work provides a step towards systematically deriving PBSRD models from more microscopic reaction models, and suggests possible constraints on the latter to ensure consistency between the two physical scales.</description>

      <title>Explicit and fully automatic analysis of magnetotactic bacteria motion reveals the magnitude and length scaling of magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a diverse group of microorganisms whose movement can be directed via a magnetic field, which makes them attractive for applications in medicine and microfluidics. One of their key properties is the magnetic moment $m$, which is challenging to measure experimentally. We perform optical imaging experiments with MSR-1 MTB, and derive both the $m$ statistics and the scaling of $m$ with the MTB size using an explicit and fully automated method to determine $m$ from the MTB trajectories via the U-turn protocol, which measures $m$ based on the U-shaped trajectories exhibited by the MTB in an applied alternating magnetic field. The proposed method is an alternative to the standard U-turn time-based moment calculation and uses the theoretical U-turn shape function we have derived. This directly accounts for the U-turn geometry and determines the moment from the U-turn branch width. We couple this approach with a robust U-turn decomposition algorithm that detects U-turns from MTB tracks regardless of their orientations. We report a linear dependence of $m$ on the size of the bacteria, accounting for the bacteria velocity variations during the U-turns. We also demonstrate that the new U-turn shape-based and the conventional time-based methods produce significantly different results. The proposed method can be used to differentiate between various types of MTB within the same population based on their velocity and magnetic moments, and to precisely characterize the magnetic properties of a culture.</description>

      <title>Motorized Chromosome Models of Mitosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During mitosis, near-spherical chromosomes reconfigure into rod-like structures to ensure their accurate segregation to daughter cells. We explore here, the interplay between the nonequilibrium activity of molecular motors in determining the chromosomal organization in mitosis and its characteristic symmetry-breaking events. We present a hybrid motorized chromosome model that highlights the distinct roles of condensin I and II in shaping mitotic chromosomes. Guided by experimental observations, the simulations suggest that condensin II facilitates large-scale scaffold formation, while condensin I is paramount in local helical loop arrangement. Together, these two distinct grappling motors establish the hierarchical helical structure characteristic of mitotic chromosomes, which exhibit striking local and, sometimes global, chirality and contribute to the robust mechanical properties of mitotic chromosomes. Accompanying the emergence of rigidity, the model provides mechanisms of forming defects, including perversions and entanglements, and shows how these may be partially resolved through condensin activity and topoisomerase action. This framework bridges coarse-grained energy landscape models of chromosome dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, advancing the understanding of chromosome organization during cell division and beyond.</description>

      <title>Static Three-Dimensional Structures Determine Fast Dynamics Between Distal Loci Pairs in Interphase Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live cell imaging experiments have shown that, although eukaryotic chromosome is compact, the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unusually rapid and cannot be explained by standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and the relaxation times is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. To resolve the puzzle, we developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by first calculating the precise three-dimensional (3D) structure using static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. The calculated 3D coordinates are used to accurately forecast the two-point dynamics reported in recent experiments that simultaneously monitor chromatin dynamics and transcription. Strikingly, the theory not only predicts the observed fast enhancer-promoter dynamics but also reveals a novel subdiffusive scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, in near quantitative agreement with recent experiments but diverging sharply from the expectations based on fractal globule models that are good descriptors of global organization of chromosomes. As a by product, we predict that cohesin depletion speeds up the dynamics between distal loci. Our framework shows that chromatin dynamics can be predicted based solely on static experimental data, reinforcing the concept that the three-dimensional structure determines their dynamic behavior. The generality of the theory opens new avenues for exploring chromatin dynamics, especially transcriptional dynamics, across diverse species.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Nodal Modularity: A novel network metric for the regional analysis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment during a working memory binding task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Biological networks, such as the brain, are known to exhibit group structure at a variety of scales -- local, meso, and global scale. Modularity, while useful in describing mesoscale brain organization, is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure. This approach, while valuable, overlooks important localized variations in community structure at the node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity ($nQ$) captures both meso and local scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that $nQ$ illuminates granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored $nQ$ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. Observed changes in $nQ$ in fMRI and DTI networks aligned with known trajectories of AD and were linked to common biomarkers of the disease, including amyloid-$\beta$ and tau. Additionally, $nQ$ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters showing indications that $nQ$ may be a useful diagnostic tool for characterizing disease stages. Our findings demonstrate the utility of $nQ$ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into temporal and disease related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, $nQ$ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Excitable dynamics and coral reef formation: A simple model of macro-scale structure development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that key aspects of the dynamical behavior of coral reefs at the macro scale, which evolve over time scales of centuries, can be accurately described using a model that integrates a few fundamental ecological and physical mechanisms. The model displays excitable behavior generating, among other dynamical regimes, traveling pulses and waves, which result in the formation of spatial structures resembling those observed in real reefs, without involving a classical pattern formation mechanism, like the Turing scenario. We conduct an in-depth exploration of the bifurcations exhibited by the model as a function of the two most ecologically significant parameters. This establishes the groundwork for using the presented model as a tool to explain coral reef formation.</description>

      <title>Underestimation of systolic pressure in cuff-based blood pressure measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High blood pressure (hypertension) is the number one risk factor for premature death. Hypertension is asymptomatic, so blood pressure must be regularly monitored to diagnose it. In auscultatory blood pressure measurement, a patient's systolic (maximum) and diastolic (minimum) blood pressure are inferred from the pressure in an inflatable cuff wrapped around the arm. This technique is the gold standard against which all other non-invasive devices are validated. However, auscultatory measurements systematically underestimate systolic blood pressure and overestimate diastolic blood pressure. Overestimation is attributed to the increased cuff pressure needed to occlude the artery because of the surrounding tissue and arterial stiffness. In contrast, the cause of systolic underestimation, which leads to potentially a third of systolic hypertension cases being missed, has remained unclear. When the cuff is inflated beyond the systolic blood pressure, the blood flow to the vessels downstream of the cuff is cut off. The pressure in these downstream vessels drops to a low plateau. We have developed a novel experimental rig that shows that the low downstream pressure is the key cause of the underestimation of systolic blood pressure. The lower the downstream pressure, the greater the underestimation. Our results yield a simple physical model for the underestimation of systolic pressure in our rig and in the human body. Understanding the physics behind the underestimation of systolic blood pressure paves the way for developing strategies to mitigate this error.</description>

      <title>Approaching the quantum limit of energy resolution in animal magnetoreception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large number of magnetic sensors, like superconducting quantum interference devices, optical pumping and nitrogen vacancy magnetometers, were shown to satisfy the energy resolution limit. This limit states that the magnetic sensitivity of the sensor, when translated into a product of energy with time, is bounded below by Planck's constant, hbar. This bound implies a fundamental limitation as to what can be achieved in magnetic sensing. Here we explore biological magnetometers, in particular three magnetoreception mechanisms thought to underly animals' geomagnetic field sensing: the radical-pair, the magnetite and the MagR mechanism. We address the question of how close these mechanisms approach the energy resolution limit. At the quantitative level, the utility of the energy resolution limit is that it informs the workings of magnetic sensing in model-independent ways, and thus can provide subtle consistency checks for theoretical models and estimated or measured parameter values, particularly needed in complex biological systems. At the qualitative level, the closer the energy resolution is to hbar, the more "quantum" is the sensor. This offers an alternative route towards understanding the quantum biology of magnetoreception. It also quantifies the room for improvement, illuminating what Nature has achieved, and stimulating the engineering of biomimetic sensors exceeding Nature's magnetic sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Modulator source as sample-free calibrator and frequency stabilizer for Brillouin Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brillouin Microscopy is a novel label-free optical technique that enables the measurement of a material's mechanical properties at the sub-micron scale in a non-invasive and non-contact way; in the last few years, its applications in the life sciences have extensively expanded. To date, many custom-built Brillouin Microscopes suffer from temporal instabilities that impact their performances, showing drifts in the acquired spectra during time that may lead to inconsistencies between data acquired at different days. A further challenge for standard Brillouin Microscopes is the calibration of the spectrometer: the currently accepted protocol in literature uses known Brillouin shifts of water and methanol to reconstruct the dispersion curve, but this approach is highly influenced by external factors that are unrelated to spectrometer's performances. Manual and frequent realignments of the spectrometer and repeated calibrations with standard materials are thus needed to address these issues. Here, we show an innovative method to remove temporal instabilities of a standard Brillouin Microscope by inserting an Electro-Optic Modulator (EOM) that can be used: i) as a reference signal during measurements; ii) as a calibrator, allowing the reconstruction of the spectrometer dispersion curve with high precision, in an automatic pipeline and without the need for reference samples; iii) as a tool to detect and compensate for temporal drifts through a feedback control in a closed loop. We here show that our Brillouin Microscope, equipped with an EOM and a tuneable laser, is able to automatically acquire data for more than 2 days without the need to realign the spectrometer; retrieved Brillouin shifts and widths showed superior stability in time than standard Brillouin Microscopes.</description>
