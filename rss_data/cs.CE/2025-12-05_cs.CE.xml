      <title>NAWOA-XGBoost: A Novel Model for Early Prediction of Academic Potential in Computer Science Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) suffers from limited global search ability, slow convergence, and tendency to fall into local optima, restricting its effectiveness in hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models. To address these issues, this study proposes a Nonlinear Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm (NAWOA), which integrates strategies such as Good Nodes Set initialization, Leader-Followers Foraging, Dynamic Encircling Prey, Triangular Hunting, and a nonlinear convergence factor to enhance exploration, exploitation, and convergence stability. Experiments on 23 benchmark functions demonstrate NAWOA's superior optimization capability and robustness. Based on this optimizer, an NAWOA-XGBoost model was developed to predict academic potential using data from 495 Computer Science undergraduates at Macao Polytechnic University (2009-2019). Results show that NAWOA-XGBoost outperforms traditional XGBoost and WOA-XGBoost across key metrics, including Accuracy (0.8148), Macro F1 (0.8101), AUC (0.8932), and G-Mean (0.8172), demonstrating strong adaptability on multi-class imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>Customer Identification for Electricity Retailers Based on Monthly Demand Profiles by Activity Sectors and Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing competition in the electric sector is challenging retail companies as they must assign its commercial efforts to attract the most profitable customers. Those are whose energy demand best fit certain target profiles, which usually depend on generation or cost policies. But, even when the demand profile is available, it is in an anonymous way, preventing its association to a particular client. In this paper, we explore a large dataset containing several millions of monthly demand profiles in Spain and use the available information about the associated economic sector and location for an indirect identification of the customers. The distance of the demand profile from the target is used to define a key performance indicator (KPI) which is used as the main driver of the proposed marketing strategy. The combined use of activity and location has been revealed as a powerful tool for indirect identification of customers, as 100,000 customers are uniquely identified, while about 300,000 clients are identifiable in small sets containing 10 or less consumers. To assess the proposed marketing strategy, it has been compared to the random attraction of new clients, showing a reduction of distance from the target of 40% for 10,000 new customers.</description>

      <title>Crack detection by holomorphic neural networks and transfer-learning-enhanced genetic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new strategy for detecting cracks in 2D solids based on strain data is introduced. Crack detection is formulated as an inverse problem and solved using genetic optimization. The novelty lies in the evaluation of the model response at each generation. Specifically, the solution to the corresponding plane elasticity problem is expressed via holomorphic potentials, which are determined by training two holomorphic neural networks. As the potentials satisfy equilibrium and traction-free conditions along the crack faces a priori, the training proceeds quickly based solely on boundary information. Training efficiency is further improved by splitting the genetic search into long-range and short-range stages, enabling the use of transfer learning in the latter. The new strategy is tested on three benchmark problems, showing that an optimal number of training epochs exists that provides the best overall performance. A comparison is also made with a popular crack detection approach that uses XFEM to compute the model response. Under the assumption of identical stress-field representation accuracy, the proposed method is found to be between 7 and 23 times faster than the XFEM-based approach. While the strategy is presented here for the simplified case of a single internal crack, generalization is feasible. Overall, the present findings demonstrate that combining genetic optimization with holomorphic neural networks and transfer learning offers a promising avenue for developing crack detection strategies with higher efficiency than those currently available.</description>

      <title>Partial multivariate transformer as a tool for cryptocurrencies time series prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting cryptocurrency prices is hindered by extreme volatility and a methodological dilemma between information-scarce univariate models and noise-prone full-multivariate models. This paper investigates a partial-multivariate approach to balance this trade-off, hypothesizing that a strategic subset of features offers superior predictive power. We apply the Partial-Multivariate Transformer (PMformer) to forecast daily returns for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT, benchmarking it against eleven classical and deep learning models. Our empirical results yield two primary contributions. First, we demonstrate that the partial-multivariate strategy achieves significant statistical accuracy, effectively balancing informative signals with noise. Second, we experiment and discuss an observable disconnect between this statistical performance and practical trading utility; lower prediction error did not consistently translate to higher financial returns in simulations. This finding challenges the reliance on traditional error metrics and highlights the need to develop evaluation criteria more aligned with real-world financial objectives.</description>

      <title>ReVeal-MT: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Multi-Transmitter Radio Environment Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately mapping the radio environment (e.g., identifying wireless signal strength at specific frequency bands and geographic locations) is crucial for efficient spectrum sharing, enabling Secondary Users~(SUs) to access underutilized spectrum bands while protecting Primary Users~(PUs). While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs.</description>

      <title>Bayes-DIC Net: Estimating Digital Image Correlation Uncertainty with Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for generating high-quality Digital Image Correlation (DIC) dataset based on non-uniform B-spline surfaces. By randomly generating control point coordinates, we construct displacement fields that encompass a variety of realistic displacement scenarios, which are subsequently used to generate speckle pattern datasets. This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks. Through these innovations, this paper offers new perspectives and methods for dataset generation and algorithm performance enhancement in the field of DIC.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Substituitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>

      <title>VNS Tokamak OpenMC-Serpent Validation for Medical Isotope Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Volumetric Neutron Source (VNS) tokamak is a proposed fusion reactor for testing and qualification of reactor components for future use in a fusion power facility, and has potential use for radioisotope production. The VNS geometry is modeled in the Serpent and OpenMC neutronics codes. Analog neutron-photon coupled simulations are carried out to compare the model's vacuum vessel and blanket components across codes. In the vacuum vessel, neutron and photon flux maps are calculated, while in the blanket region, neutron and photon spectra, (n,T), and (n,2n) reaction rates are calculated and compared between models. The detector response comparisons found the following: neutron flux and (n,T) reactions achieved excellent agreement, the (n,2n) detector response had good agreement, and photon flux had regional discrepancies depending on Serpent tracking used. Hybrid tracking lead to a relative difference of about 20% in the outboard side blanket, where as employment of delta tracking resulted in less than 1% relative difference. On an HPC cluster, Serpent was found to have shorter computation time than OpenMC in neutron photon coupled simulations using both hybrid tracking and delta tracking, but longer in neutron only simulations. An exemplary radioisotope production case is presented for the demonstration of additional VNS capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Model Based Approach for Evaluating Task-Competence of Antagonistic Continuum Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robot arms have made significant progress towards completing human-scale tasks, but designing arms for tasks with specific load and workspace requirements remains difficult. A key challenge is the lack of model-based design tools, forcing advancement to occur through empirical iteration and observation. Existing models are focused on control and rely on parameter fits, which means they cannot provide general conclusions about the mapping between design and performance or the influence of factors outside the fitting data.As a first step toward model-based design tools, we introduce a novel method of analyzing whether a proposed arm design can complete desired tasks. Our method is informative, interpretable, and fast; it provides novel metrics for quantifying a proposed arm design's ability to perform a task, it yields a graphical interpretation of performance through segment forces, and computing it is over 80x faster than optimization based methods.Our formulation focuses on antagonistic, pneumatically-driven soft arms. We demonstrate our approach through example analysis, and also through consideration of antagonistic vs non-antagonistic designs. Our method enables fast, direct and task-specific comparison of these two architectures, and provides a new visualization of the comparative mechanics. While only a first step, the proposed approach will support advancement of model-based design tools, leading to highly capable soft arms.</description>
