      <title>Social Learning in Lung Transplant Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the allocation of deceased-donor lungs to patients in need of a transplant. Patients make sequential decisions in an order dictated by a priority policy. Using data from a prominent Organ Procurement Organization in the United States, we provide reduced-form evidence of social learning: because patients accept or reject organs in sequence, their decisions exhibit herding behavior, often rejecting an organ that would otherwise be accepted. We develop and estimate a structural model to quantify the impact of various policy proposals and informational regimes. Our results show that blinding patients to their position in the sequence\textemdash thereby eliminating social learning\textemdash boosts organ allocation but reduces average utility per patient. In contrast, prioritizing patients by their likelihood of acceptance exacerbates social learning, leading to fewer organ allocations. Nevertheless, it raises utility per accepted organ and expedites the allocation process.</description>

      <title>Air Pollution and Under-5 Child Mortality: Evidence from China's Coal Power Plant Phase-out Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the impact of a mandatory shutdown policy of small-capacity coal power plants during China's $11^{th}$ Five-Year Plan (2006--2010) on under-5 mortality. We collect information on 2181 coal power plants that operated during 2000--2010 and compile a unique dataset combining coal power plants, county-level under-5 mortality and socioeconomic variables, high spatial resolution data of PM$_{2.5}$ and SO$_2$ and meteorological conditions. We model the impacts of air pollution on under-5 mortality using IV-Lasso method, with distance-weighted sums of retired capacity and high altitude wind conditions as instrument candidates for air pollutants. Our estimates imply the phase-out policy saved around 46,000 lives during the $11^{th}$ Five-Year Plan period. We also find heterogeneity in policy effects across regions.</description>

      <title>Disagreement Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As US political party leaders increasingly take stances both on economic and cultural (i.e., social policy) issues, the economic views of opposite cultural groups are growing apart. This paper explores a novel explanation for this phenomenon. I provide experimental evidence that adding social policy content to a policy message pushes those disagreeing with the social policy to disagree also with the economic content of the message. As my results suggest regular deviations from Bayesian explanations, I propose a model of identity-based belief updating that predicts the main regularities found in the experiment. Finally, I shed light on opinion leaders' incentives to strengthen the association between social policy and economic policy views.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on Online Usage Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy regulations often necessitate a balance between safeguarding consumer privacy and preventing economic losses for firms that utilize consumer data. However, little empirical evidence exists on how such laws affect firm performance. This study aims to fill that gap by quantifying the impact of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on online usage behavior over time. We analyzed data from 6,286 websites across 24 industries, covering 10 months before and 18 months after the GDPR's enactment in 2018. Employing a generalized synthetic control estimator, we isolated the short- and long-term effects of the GDPR on user behavior. Our results show that the GDPR negatively affected online usage per website on average; specifically, weekly visits decreased by 4.88% in the first 3 months and 10.02% after 18 months post-enactment. At the 18-month mark, these declines translated into average revenue losses of about USD 7 million for e-commerce websites and nearly USD 2.5 million for ad-based websites. Nonetheless, the GDPR's impact varied across website size, industry, and user origin, with some large websites and industries benefiting from the regulation. Notably, the largest 10% of websites pre-GDPR suffered less, suggesting that the GDPR has increased market concentration.</description>

      <title>Direct Fractional Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper designs a market algorithm for fractional ownership of an indivisible asset. It provides an efficient market mechanism, named Direct Fractional Auction (DFA) that offers valuable assets to both small and large investors who can become partial owners of such assets. Additionally, it introduces procedures and algorithms with DFA to determine the optimal winning combinations of unaffiliated bidders. DFA, on the one hand, transfers the partial ownership to the winners and, on the other, redirects the proceeds from the auctions to the sellers. We show that the DFA algorithm works more efficiently than the Greedy algorithm in maximizing the seller's value. We also demonstrate the possibility of reducing the complexity of the problem using the "pruning" method for data pre-processing.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Flexibility in Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexibility is a cornerstone of operations management, crucial to hedge stochasticity in product demands, service requirements, and resource allocation. In two-sided platforms, flexibility is also two-sided and can be viewed as the compatibility of agents on one side with agents on the other side. Platform actions often influence the flexibility on either the demand or the supply side. But how should flexibility be jointly allocated across different sides? Whereas the literature has traditionally focused on only one side at a time, our work initiates the study of two-sided flexibility in matching platforms. We propose a parsimonious matching model in random graphs and identify the flexibility allocation that optimizes the expected size of a maximum matching. Our findings reveal that flexibility allocation is a first-order issue: for a given flexibility budget, the resulting matching size can vary greatly depending on how the budget is allocated. Moreover, even in the simple and symmetric settings we study, the quest for the optimal allocation is complicated. In particular, easy and costly mistakes can be made if the flexibility decisions on the demand and supply side are optimized independently (e.g., by two different teams in the company), rather than jointly. To guide the search for optimal flexibility allocation, we uncover two effects, flexibility cannibalization, and flexibility abundance, that govern when the optimal design places the flexibility budget only on one side or equally on both sides. In doing so we identify the study of two-sided flexibility as a significant aspect of platform efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Usage and Exam Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the impact of students' usage of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT on their exam performance. We analyse student essays using GenAI detection systems to identify GenAI users among the cohort. Employing multivariate regression analysis, we find that students using GenAI tools score on average 6.71 (out of 100) points lower than non-users. While GenAI may offer benefits for learning and engagement, the way students actually use it correlates with diminished exam outcomes. Exploring the underlying mechanism, additional analyses show that the effect is particularly detrimental to students with high learning potential, suggesting an effect whereby GenAI tool usage hinders learning. Our findings provide important empirical evidence for the ongoing debate on the integration of GenAI in higher education and underscores the necessity for educators, institutions, and policymakers to carefully consider its implications for student performance.</description>

      <title>Take Caution in Using LLMs as Human Surrogates: Scylla Ex Machina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like reasoning, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Financial Forecasting: Analyzing the Suitability of AI Models for Dollar/TL Exchange Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence has made significant contributions to the financial sector. One of the main interests of investors is price predictions. Technical and fundamental analyses, as well as econometric analyses, are conducted for price predictions; recently, the use of AI-based methods has become more prevalent. This study examines daily Dollar/TL exchange rates from January 1, 2020, to October 4, 2024. It has been observed that among artificial intelligence models, random forest, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and gradient boosting models were not suitable; however, multilayer perceptron and linear regression models showed appropriate suitability and despite the sharp increase in Dollar/TL rates in Turkey as of 2019, the suitability of valid models has been maintained.</description>
