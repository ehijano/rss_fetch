      <title>Using Felis to Represent the Semantics and Metadata of Astronomical Data Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Data Management team of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory has developed a data description language and toolset, Felis, for defining the semantics and metadata of its public-facing data catalogs. Felis uses a rich Pydantic data model for describing and validating catalog metadata, expressed as a human-readable and editable YAML format. Felis also provides a Python library and command line interface for working with these data models. The metadata is used to populate the TAP_SCHEMA tables for the IVOA TAP services utilized by the Rubin Science Platform (RSP). Felis's current capabilities will be discussed along with some future plans.</description>

      <title>Glow reduction of ultra-low noise LmAPDs: towards photon counting infrared arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy and direct-imaging of ultra-faint targets such as Earth-like exoplanets and high redshift galaxies are among the primary goals of upcoming large scale astronomy projects like the Habitable World Observatory (HWO). Such objectives pose extreme instrumental challenges, in particular on detectors where dark currents lower than 1 e-/pixel/kilosecond and read noise less than 1 e-/pixel/frame will have to be achieved on large format arrays. Some technologies meet these requirements at optical wavelengths, but none do in the infrared. With this goal in mind, the University of Hawaii has partnered with Leonardo to develop linear-mode avalanche photodiodes (LmAPDs). In this paper, we report recent tests performed on LmAPDs, where we measure a ROIC glow of approximately 0.01 e-/pixel/frame, without which the intrinsic dark current is essentally zero (&lt; 0.1 e- /pixel/kilosecond). We show that at high gain, these devices are capable of detecting single photons</description>

      <title>Africanus II. QuartiCal: calibrating radio interferometer data at scale using Numba and Dask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration of radio interferometer data ought to be a solved problem; it has been an integral part of data reduction for some time. However, as larger, more sensitive radio interferometers are conceived and built, the calibration problem grows in both size and difficulty.
  The increasing size can be attributed to the fact that the data volume scales quadratically with the number of antennas in an array. Additionally, new instruments may have up to two orders of magnitude more channels than their predecessors. Simultaneously, increasing sensitivity is making calibration more challenging: low-level RFI and calibration artefacts (in the resulting images) which would previously have been subsumed by the noise may now limit dynamic range and, ultimately, the derived science.
  It is against this backdrop that we introduce QuartiCal: a new Python package implementing radio interferometric calibration routines. QuartiCal improves upon its predecessor, CubiCal, in terms of both flexibility and performance. Whilst the same mathematical framework - complex optimization using Wirtinger derivatives - is in use, the approach has been refined to support arbitrary length chains of parameterized gain terms.
  QuartiCal utilizes Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python, to express calibration as an embarrassingly parallel task graph. These task graphs can (with some constraints) be mapped onto a number of different hardware configurations, allowing QuartiCal to scale from running locally on consumer hardware to a distributed, cloud-based cluster.
  QuartiCal's qualitative behaviour is demonstrated using MeerKAT observations of PSR J2009-2026. These qualitative results are followed by an analysis of QuartiCal's performance in terms of wall time and memory footprint for a number of calibration scenarios and hardware configurations.</description>

      <title>Africanus III. pfb-imaging -- a flexible radio interferometric imaging suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of the CLEAN algorithm in radio interferometric imaging stems from its maturity, speed, and robustness. While many alternatives have been proposed in the literature, none have achieved mainstream adoption by astronomers working with data from interferometric arrays operating in the big data regime. This lack of adoption is largely due to increased computational complexity, absence of mature implementations, and the need for astronomers to tune obscure algorithmic parameters.
  This work introduces pfb-imaging: a flexible library that implements the scaffolding required to develop and accelerate general radio interferometric imaging algorithms. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to implement a sparsity-based image reconstruction technique known as (unconstrained) SARA in a way that scales with image size rather than data volume and features interpretable algorithmic parameters. The implementation is validated on terabyte-sized data from the MeerKAT telescope, using both a single compute node and Amazon Web Services computing instances.</description>

      <title>Africanus IV. The Stimela2 framework: scalable and reproducible workflows, from local to cloud compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimela2 is a new-generation framework for developing data reduction workflows. It is designed for radio astronomy data but can be adapted for other data processing applications. Stimela2 aims at the middle ground between ease of development, human readability, and enabling robust, scalable and reproducible workflows. It represents workflows by linear, concise and intuitive YAML-format "recipes". Atomic data reduction tasks (binary executables, Python functions and code, and CASA tasks) are described by YAML-format "cab definitions" detailing each task's "schema" (inputs and outputs). Stimela2 provides a rich syntax for chaining tasks together, and encourages a high degree of modularity: recipes may be nested into other recipes, and configuration is cleanly separated from recipe logic. Tasks can be executed natively or in isolated environments using containerization technologies such as Apptainer. The container images are open-source and maintained through a companion package called cult-cargo. This enables the development of system-agnostic and fully reproducible workflows. Stimela2 facilitates the deployment of scalable, distributed workflows by interfacing with the Slurm scheduler and the Kubernetes API. The latter allows workflows to be readily deployed in the cloud. Previous papers in this series used Stimela2 as the underlying technology to run workflows on the AWS cloud.
  This paper presents an overview of Stimela2's design, architecture and use in the radio astronomy context.</description>

      <title>Large-format photodetecting system pCam6060 with a GSENSE6060BSI CMOS detector, developed at SAO RAS and optimized for photometric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pCam6060 photodetecting system was developed at SAO RAS and is based on the GSENSE6060BSI photodetector manufactured by GPixel (China) with a frame format of 6144x6144 active pixels and a pixel size of 10 mkm. The readout speed reached 11 fps. The back-illuminated detector has a wide spectral range of 200-1040 nm with a minimum quantum efficiency (QE) of 10% and maximum sensitivity of 95% at 580 nm. The quantum efficiency in the near-infrared range was 58% at 850 nm. The pCam6060 system controller implements a mode of simultaneous image readout via two 12-bit video channels with different gain and their subsequent combination in the controller into a single frame with an extended 16-bit dynamic range. This method simultaneously achieves a low readout noise level (about 3 e-) in the high-gain channel and a large dynamic range (full well capacity of about 100000 e-) in the low-gain channel. Back-illuminated CMOS detectors, unlike front-illuminated devices, do not have the effect of long-term preserving the residual charge from previous exposures, which makes them suitable for recording faint objects in photometric long-exposure observation methods. Communication between the host computer and the camera was carried out via a fiber optic line at distances of up to 50 m. Video data are recorded on the computer hard drive in real-time. The pCam6060 photodetecting system is designed for astronomical applications and has a moisture-proof design.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of the MIRAC-5 Mid-Infrared Instrument on the MMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from commissioning observations of the mid-IR instrument, MIRAC-5, on the 6.5-m MMT telescope. MIRAC-5 is a novel ground-based instrument that utilizes a state-of-the-art GeoSnap (2 - 13 microns) HgCdTe detector with adaptive optics support from MAPS to study protoplanetary disks, wide-orbit brown dwarfs, planetary companions in the contrast-limit, and a wide range of other astrophysical objects. We have used MIRAC-5 on six engineering observing runs, improving its performance and defining operating procedures. We characterize key aspects of MIRAC-5's performance, including verification that the total telescope, atmosphere, instrument, and detector throughput is approximately 10%. Following a planned dichroic upgrade, the system will have a throughput of 20% and background limiting magnitudes (for SNR = 5 and 8 hour exposure times) of 18.0, 15.6, and 12.6 for the L', M', and N' filters, respectively. The detector pixels experience 1/f noise but, if the astrophysical scene is properly modulated via chopping and nodding sequences, it is less than 10% the Poisson noise from the observed background in an 85 Hz frame. We achieve close to diffraction-limited performance in the N-band and all bands are expected to reach diffraction-limited performance following the adaptive optics system commissioning. We also present an exposure time calculator calibrated to the on-sky results. In its current state, MIRAC-5 will be capable of achieving several scientific objectives including the observation of warm wide-orbit companions. Once the adaptive optics is commissioned and a coronagraph installed in 2025, MIRAC-5 will have contrast-limited performance comparable to JWST, opening new and complementary science investigations for close-in companions.</description>

      <title>Low two-level-system noise in hydrogenated amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At sub-Kelvin temperatures, two-level systems (TLS) present in amorphous dielectrics source a permittivity noise, degrading the performance of a wide range of devices using superconductive resonators such as qubits or kinetic inductance detectors. We report here on measurements of TLS noise in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in superconductive lumped-element resonators using parallel-plate capacitors (PPCs). The TLS noise results presented in this article for two recipes of a-Si:H improve on the best achieved in the literature by a factor &gt;5 for a-Si:H and other amorphous dielectrics and are comparable to those observed for resonators deposited on crystalline dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Time Series Clustering for Environmental State Characterization of Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observatories like LIGO are large-scale, terrestrial instruments housed in infrastructure that spans a multi-kilometer geographic area and which must be actively controlled to maintain operational stability for long observation periods. Despite exquisite seismic isolation, they remain susceptible to seismic noise and other terrestrial disturbances that can couple undesirable vibrations into the instrumental infrastructure, potentially leading to control instabilities or noise artifacts in the detector output. It is, therefore, critical to characterize the seismic state of these observatories to identify a set of temporal patterns that can inform the detector operators in day-to-day monitoring and diagnostics. On a day-to-day basis, the operators monitor several seismically relevant data streams to diagnose operational instabilities and sources of noise using some simple empirically-determined thresholds. It can be untenable for a human operator to monitor multiple data streams in this manual fashion and thus a distillation of these data-streams into a more human-friendly format is sought. In this paper, we present an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for features-based multivariate time series clustering to achieve this goal and to provide actionable insights to the detector operators by correlating found clusters with events of interest in the detector.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Systematic Planetary Nebulae Detection with the Census of the Local Universe Narrowband Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of a systematic planetary nebula (PN) search in the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) narrowband (H$\alpha$) survey that covers a considerably larger sky region of above declination $-20^\circ$ than most previous surveys. Using PNe observed by the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS) as validation, we are able to visually recover 432 out of 441 cataloged PNe (98\%) within the CLU dataset, with 5 sources having unusable CLU images and 4 missed due to limitations of imaging quality. Moreover, the reference PNe are conventionally divided into three PN classes in decreasing order of identification confidence given their spectra and morphologies. We record consistently high recovery rate across all classes: 95\% of True, 71\% of Likely, and 81\% of Possible sources are readily recovered. To further demonstrate the ability of CLU to find new PNe, we undertake a preliminary search of compact PNe within a sub-region of the validation catalog, mainly utilizing the significance of narrow-band colors ($\Sigma$) as a metric for identification. In a $200\,\rm deg^2$ region, we search the CLU source catalog and find 31 PN candidates after automated and visual scrutiny, of which 12 are new sources not appearing in previous studies. As a demonstration of our ongoing follow-up campaign, we present medium-resolution optical spectra of six candidates and notice that four of them show emission signatures characteristic of confirmed PNe. As we refine our selection methods, CLU promises to provide a systematic catalog of PNe spanning $2/3$ of the sky.</description>

      <title>PAStar: a model for stellar surface from the Sun to active stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The characterization of exoplanets requires a good description of the host star. Stellar activity acts as a source of noise which can alter planet radii as derived from the transit depth or atmospheric characterization. Aims. Here, we propose PAStar, a model to describe photospheric activity in the form of spots and faculae which could be applied to a wide range of stellar observations, from photometric to spectroscopic time series, to be able to correctly extract planetary and stellar properties. Methods. The adopted stellar atmosphere is a combination of three components, the quiet photosphere, spots and faculae. The model takes into account the effects of star inclination, doppler shifts due to stellar rotation as well as for limb darkening, independent for each component. Several synthetic products have been presented to show the capabilities of the model. Results. The model is able to retrieve the input surface inhomogeneities configuration through photometric or spectroscopic observations. The model has been validated against optical solar data and compared to alternative stellar surface activity models; e.g. SOAP code. The Sun is a unique laboratory to test stellar models because of the possibility to relate unambiguously flux variations to surface inhomogeneities configuration. This validation has been done by analyzing a photometric time series from the VIRGO photometer on board of SOHO mission. Results have been compared to real solar images from the HMI instrument on board of SDO to confirm the goodness of the results in terms of surface inhomogeneities position and dimensions. Conclusions. The description of stellar activity is a fundamental step in several astrophysical contexts and it is covered by the method we have presented. Our model offers a flexible and valuable tool to describe the activity of stars when it is dominated by spots and faculae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing research by enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets and the discovery of hidden patterns. In astrophysics, AI has become essential, transforming the classification of celestial sources, data modeling, and the interpretation of observations. In this review, I highlight examples of AI applications in astrophysics, including source classification, spectral energy distribution modeling, and discuss the advancements achievable through generative AI. However, the use of AI introduces challenges, including biases, errors, and the "black box" nature of AI models, which must be resolved before their application. These issues can be addressed through the concept of Human-Guided AI (HG-AI), which integrates human expertise and domain-specific knowledge into AI applications. This approach aims to ensure that AI is applied in a robust, interpretable, and ethical manner, leading to deeper insights and fostering scientific excellence.</description>

      <title>RTFAST-Spectra: Emulation of X-ray reverberation mapping for active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian analysis has begun to be more widely adopted in X-ray spectroscopy, but it has largely been constrained to relatively simple physical models due to limitations in X-ray modelling software and computation time. As a result, Bayesian analysis of numerical models with high physics complexity have remained out of reach. This is a challenge, for example when modelling the X-ray emission of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, where the slow model computations severely limit explorations of parameter space and may bias the inference of astrophysical parameters. Here, we present RTFAST-Spectra: a neural network emulator that acts as a drop in replacement for the spectral portion of the black hole X-ray reverberation model RTDIST. This is the first emulator for the reltrans model suite and the first emulator for a state-of-the-art x-ray reflection model incorporating relativistic effects with 17 physically meaningful model parameters. We use Principal Component Analysis to create a light-weight neural network that is able to preserve correlations between complex atomic lines and simple continuum, enabling consistent modelling of key parameters of scientific interest. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ times speed up over the original model in the most conservative conditions with $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ precision over all 17 free parameters in the original numerical model, taking full posterior fits from months to hours. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to show how we can better explore the posteriors of model parameters in simulated data and discuss the complexities in interpreting the model when fitting real data.</description>

      <title>Ultra Low Velocity Ejecta Generated by Slow Impacts on Rubble Pile Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine ejecta generated by ultra low velocity impacts under asteroid conditions. In an environment of precisely controlled milligravity and under vacuum, impacts with velocities in the range of centimeters/second are performed with irregularly shaped impactors onto granular beds. The resulting ejecta velocities are compared to existing literature values and extend the observed systematic trends towards lower impact energies, broadening the parameter range. Simulations are performed to reason the systematics and the absence thereof for measurements performed at earth gravity. We find, that the cutoff induced by gravity dependent minimal observable velocities plays a crucial role in the values obtained for mean ejecta velocities.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference on warm dark matter from HERA forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21cm signal from Cosmic Dawn promises to open a new window into the early history of our universe and enable the probing of an unprecedented comoving survey volume. In this work, we revisit the imprint of Warm Dark Matter (WDM) on the 21cm signal power spectrum using an updated implementation of the WDM effect in the public code $\texttt{21cmFast}$ and considering a single population of cosmic dawn galaxies. By focusing on inferring the WDM mass, we analyze the degeneracies between the latter and the astrophysics parameters characterizing star formation and X-ray heating and we emphasize the role of the threshold mass for star-forming galaxies, $M_{\rm turn}$. We study the capability of the recently built HERA telescope to reconstruct the WDM mass by adopting the statistical approach of simulation-based inference. We include a comparison of the per-parameter reconstruction quality for different number of simulations used in the training of the algorithm. Our results indicate that HERA could surpass current Lyman-$\alpha$ forest constraints if Cosmic Dawn galaxies exhibit a threshold mass $M_{\rm turn}\lesssim 10^{8}\, M_\odot$. The X-ray source properties considered in this study may also influence the strength of the WDM constraint for lower threshold masses.</description>

      <title>BIPP: An efficient HPC implementation of the Bluebild algorithm for radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bluebild algorithm is a new technique for image synthesis in radio astronomy which decomposes the sky into distinct energy levels using functional principal component analysis. These levels can be linearly combined to construct a least-squares estimate of the radio sky, i.e. minimizing the residuals between measured and predicted visibilities. This approach is particularly useful for deconvolution-free imaging or for scientific applications that need to filter specific energy levels. We present an HPC implementation of the Bluebild algorithm for radio-interferometric imaging: Bluebild Imaging++ (BIPP). The library features interfaces to C++, C and Python and is designed with seamless GPU acceleration in mind. We evaluate the accuracy and performance of BIPP on simulated observations of the upcoming Square Kilometer Array Observatory and real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. We find that BIPP offers accurate wide-field imaging and has competitive execution time with respect to the interferometric imaging libraries CASA and WSClean for images with $\leq 10^6$ pixels. Furthermore, due to the energy level decomposition, images produced with BIPP can reveal information about faint and diffuse structures before any cleaning iterations. BIPP does not perform any regularization, but we suggest methods to integrate the output of BIPP with CLEAN. The source code of BIPP is publicly released.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>

      <title>The classification of real and bogus transients using active learning and semi-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep-learning-based methods have been favored in astrophysics owing to their adaptability and remarkable performance and have been applied to the task of the classification of real and bogus transients. Different from most existing approaches which necessitate massive yet expensive annotated data, We aim to leverage training samples with only 1000 labels available to discover real sources that vary in brightness over time in the early stage of the WFST 6-year survey. Methods. We present a novel deep-learning method that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning to construct a competitive real/bogus classifier. Our method incorporates an active learning stage, where we actively select the most informative or uncertain samples for annotation. This stage aims to achieve higher model performance by leveraging fewer labeled samples, thus reducing annotation costs and improving the overall learning process efficiency. Furthermore, our approach involves a semi-supervised learning stage that exploits the unlabeled data to enhance the model's performance and achieve superior results compared to using only the limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{UFig v1}$: The ultra-fast image generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need to be fast as well as realistic. $\texttt{UFig v1}$ is a public Python package that generates simulated astronomical images with exceptional speed - taking approximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly well-suited for simulation-based inference (SBI) methods where computational efficiency is crucial. To render an image, $\texttt{UFig}$ requires a galaxy catalog and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add background noise, sample stars using the Besan\c{c}on model of the Milky Way, and run $\texttt{SExtractor}$ to extract sources from the rendered image. The extracted sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on $\texttt{SExtractor}$ output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to bypass the image simulation and extraction steps. A first version of $\texttt{UFig}$ was presented in Berg\'e et al. (2013) and the software has since been used and further developed in a variety of forward modelling applications.</description>
