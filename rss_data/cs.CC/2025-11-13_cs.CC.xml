      <title>Random Permutations in Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical results of Bennett and Gill (1981) show that with probability 1, $P^A \neq NP^A$ relative to a random oracle $A$, and with probability 1, $P^\pi \neq NP^\pi \cap coNP^\pi$ relative to a random permutation $\pi$. Whether $P^A = NP^A \cap coNP^A$ holds relative to a random oracle $A$ remains open. While the random oracle separation has been extended to specific individually random oracles--such as Martin-L\"of random or resource-bounded random oracles--no analogous result is known for individually random permutations.
  We introduce a new resource-bounded measure framework for analyzing individually random permutations. We define permutation martingales and permutation betting games that characterize measure-zero sets in the space of permutations, enabling formal definitions of resource-bounded random permutations.
  Our main result shows that $P^\pi \neq NP^\pi \cap coNP^\pi$ for every polynomial-time betting-game random permutation $\pi$. This is the first separation result relative to individually random permutations, rather than an almost-everywhere separation. We also strengthen a quantum separation of Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani (1997) by showing that $NP^\pi \cap coNP^\pi \not\subseteq BQP^\pi$ for every polynomial-space random permutation $\pi$.
  We investigate the relationship between random permutations and random oracles. We prove that random oracles are polynomial-time reducible from random permutations. The converse--whether every random permutation is reducible from a random oracle--remains open. We show that if $NP \cap coNP$ is not a measurable subset of $EXP$, then $P^A \neq NP^A \cap coNP^A$ holds with probability 1 relative to a random oracle $A$. Conversely, establishing this random oracle separation with time-bounded measure would imply $BPP$ is a measure 0 subset of $EXP$.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of freezing automata networks of bounded pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automata network is a graph of entities, each holding a state from a finite set and evolving according to a local update rule which depends only on its neighbors in the network's graph. It is freezing if there is an order on the states such that the state evolution of any node is non-decreasing in any orbit. They are commonly used to model epidemic propagation, diffusion phenomena like bootstrap percolation or cristal growth. Previous works have established that, under the hypothesis that the network graph is of bounded treewidth, many problems that can be captured by trace specifications at individual nodes admit efficient algorithms. In this paper we study the even more restricted case of a network of bounded pathwidth and show two hardness results that somehow illustrate the complexity of freezing dynamics under such a strong graph constraint. First, we show that the trace specification checking problem is NL-complete. Second, we show that deciding first order properties of the orbits augmented with a reachability predicate is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Tracing AG Codes: Toward Meeting the Gilbert-Varshamov Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in coding theory is to match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with explicit binary codes. Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.
  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Separating QMA from QCMA with a classical oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.
  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.</description>

      <title>Condensing and Extracting Against Online Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tasks of deterministically condensing and extracting from Online Non-Oblivious Symbol Fixing (oNOSF) sources, a natural model of defective randomness where extraction is impossible in many parameter regimes [AORSV, EUROCRYPT'20]. A $(g,\ell)$-oNOSF source is a sequence of $\ell$ blocks where at least $g$ blocks are good (independent, with min-entropy) and the remaining bad blocks are controlled by an online adversary and can be arbitrarily correlated with prior blocks.
  Previously, [CGR, FOCS'24] proved impossibility of condensing beyond rate $1/2$ when $g\le 0.5 \ell$ and showed existence of condensers for when $g \ge 0.51\ell$ and $n$ is exponential in $\ell$.
  In this work, not only do we construct the first explicit condensers matching the existential results of [CGR, FOCS'24], but we make a doubly exponential improvement by handling the case when $g\ge 0.51\ell$ and $n$ is only polylogarithmic in $\ell$. We also obtain a much improved explicit construction for transforming low-entropy oNOSF sources into uniform oNOSF sources.
  Next, we essentially resolve the question of the existence of condensers for oNOSF sources by showing the existence of condensers even when $n$ is a large enough constant and $\ell$ is growing (provided $g \ge 0.51\ell$).
  We apply our condensers to collective coin flipping and collective sampling, widely studied problems in fault-tolerant distributed computing, and provide very simple protocols for them.
  Finally, we study the possibility of extraction from oNOSF sources. For lower bounds, we introduce the notion of online influence - extending the notion of influence of boolean functions - and establish tight bounds that imply extraction lower bounds. We also construct explicit extractors via leader election protocols that beat standard resilient functions [AL, Combinatorica'93].</description>

      <title>Hiding, Shuffling, and Cycle Finding: Quantum Algorithms on Edge Lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The edge list model is arguably the simplest input model for graphs, where the graph is specified by a list of its edges. In this model, we study the quantum query complexity of three variants of the triangle finding problem. The first asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target edge and raises general questions about the hiding of a problem's input among irrelevant data. The second asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target vertex and raises general questions about the shuffling of a problem's input. The third asks whether there exists a triangle; this problem bridges the $3$-distinctness and $3$-sum problems, which have been extensively studied by both cryptographers and complexity theorists. We provide tight or nearly tight results for these problems as well as some first answers to the general questions they raise.
  Furthermore, given any graph with low maximum degree, such as a typical random sparse graph, we prove that the quantum query complexity of finding a length-$k$ cycle in its length-$m$ edge list is $m^{3/4-1/(2^{k+2}-4)\pm o(1)}$, which matches the best-known upper bound for the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness on length-$m$ inputs up to an $m^{o(1)}$ factor. We prove the lower bound by developing new techniques within Zhandry's recording query framework [CRYPTO '19] as generalized by Hamoudi and Magniez [ToCT '23]. These techniques extend the framework to treat any non-product distribution that results from conditioning a product distribution on the absence of rare events. We prove the upper bound by adapting Belovs's learning graph algorithm for $k$-distinctness [FOCS '12]. Finally, assuming a plausible conjecture concerning only cycle finding, we show that the lower bound can be lifted to an essentially tight lower bound on the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness, which is a long-standing open question.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Reconquering Bell sampling on qudits: stabilizer learning and testing, quantum pseudorandomness bounds, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d &gt; 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</description>
