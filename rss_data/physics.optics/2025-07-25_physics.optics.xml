      <title>Modular and Automated Workflow for Streamlined Raman Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for material characterization. However, careful preprocessing is required for the identification and handling of noise, baseline drift, and random spikes. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to generating and preprocessing Raman spectra. Additionally, we describe methods for fitting Voigt peaks to the spectrum to determine peak parameters. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using both synthetic and real Raman spectra, with code provided in an open-source GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types</description>

      <title>Temporal Broadening of Attosecond Pulse Trains Induced by Multi-Band inference in Solid-State High-Order Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism underlying high harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been well clarified, characterizing attosecond pulse trains (APT) in the time domain, significantly advances the synthesis of isolated attosecond pulse (IAP). However, the complexity of HHG in solid obstacles IAP separation. Here, we use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to investigate the multiband mechanism of APT in solid state with bulk silicon as prototype. Our research unveils that: 1. The temporal characteristics of APT can be characterized by the occupation of electrons in different energy bands. 2. Due to the temporal occupation difference caused by optical transition allowed (or forbidden) by symmetry between different conduction bands and valence bands, a harmful phase shift in harmonics emission to APT for extracting IAP occurs. Our findings not only shed light on the mechanisms behind solid-state HHG but also provide new avenues to control APT to generate IAP.</description>

      <title>Multicolor interband solitons in microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In microcombs, solitons can drive non-soliton-forming modes to induce optical gain. Under specific conditions, a regenerative secondary temporal pulse coinciding in time and space with the exciting soliton pulse will form at a new spectral location. A mechanism involving Kerr-induced pulse interactions has been proposed theoretically, leading to multicolor solitons containing constituent phase-locked pulses. However, the occurrence of this phenomenon requires dispersion conditions that are not naturally satisfied in conventional optical microresonators. Here, we report the experimental observation of multicolor pulses from a single optical pump in a way that is closely related to the concept of multicolor solitons. The individual soliton pulses share the same repetition rate and could potentially be fully phase-locked. They are generated using interband coupling in a compound resonator.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the noise-tracking-bandwidth limits in Free-running Dual-Comb Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a straightforward method to extend the noise-tracking bandwidth for self-correction algorithms in free-running dual-comb interferometry, leveraging coherent-harmonic-enhanced dual-comb spectroscopy. As a proof of concept, we employed both this novel architecture and a conventional one to perform free-running dual-comb spectroscopy of a $\text{H}^{13}\text{C}^{14}\text{N}$ gas cell, demonstrating a 20-fold increase in tracking bandwidth at the same spectral resolution of 12.5 MHz. Since this approach improves the tracking bandwidth by generating harmonic centerbursts within an interferogram period, it decouples the tracking bandwidth from the repetition rate difference, thus avoiding spectral acquisition bandwidth narrowing. This significantly broadens the outlook for free-running dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Indirect multiphoton scattering between light and bulk plasmons via ultrafast free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient coupling between light and bulk plasmons (BPs) remains a central challenge because of their inherent mode mismatch, limited penetration depth, and pronounced resonant energy mismatch between visible-range photons and BPs. In this work, we demonstrate that ultrafast free electrons can coherently mediate an interaction between electromagnetic fields and BPs at the nanoscale. An electron pulse emitted from the photocathode of ultrafast transmission electron microscope, functions as a quantum intermediary that is capable of simultaneously interacting with the laser field by multiphoton processes and BPs by perturbative scattering. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can capture this indirect interaction, the final electron energy distribution encodes both quantum pathways arising from distinct combinations of multiphoton absorption and emission and BP scattering events. Interference among these pathways gives rise to characteristic spectral modulations, directly revealing the exchange of energy and information between photons and BPs via the electron delivery. Our results show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable route to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume, thereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on manipulating surface plasmons by light. This indirect light-BP interaction paves the promising way for exploring fundamental light-matter interaction at ultrafast and nanometer scales.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband Integrated Photonics Empowering Full-Spectrum Adaptive Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) and beyond (XG) wireless networks are poised to operate across an expansive frequency range from microwave, millimeter-wave to terahertz bands to support ubiquitous connectivity in diverse application scenarios. This necessitates a one-size-fits-all hardware solution that can be adaptively reconfigured within this wide spectrum to support full-band coverage and dynamic spectrum management. However, existing electrical or photonic-assisted wireless communication solutions see significant challenges in meeting this demand due to the limited bandwidths of individual devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of their system architectures. Here, we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a universal thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless engine. Leveraging the strong Pockels effect and excellent scalability of the TFLN platform, we achieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including baseband modulation, broadband wireless-photonic conversion, and reconfigurable carrier/local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic oscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high frequency stability and consistent coherence. Based on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we realize, for the first time, full-link wireless communication across 9 consecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The real-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a crucial capability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum environments. Our proposed system marks a significant step towards future full-spectrum and omni-scenario wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Inverse Design of Metasurfaces for Tailored Narrow Band Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed method results in a reduction of training time by one-third and a decrease in data requirements by 30\% when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches. The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity of 95\% in relation to the target absorption spectra. Additionally, the integration of a material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto the order of $10^3$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design using Physics-Informed Quantum GANs for Tailored Absorption in Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Q-factor narrow-band absorption exhibits high spectral selectivity enabling high-sensitive photodetectors, sensors and thermal emitters. All-dielectric metasurfaces are widely regarded as excellent candidates for giving rise to such narrow-band absorption. However, designing metasurfaces with specific functionalities remains a challenging task both experimentally and computationally, which is why inverse design methods are increasingly being explored. Inverse design process is highly complex due to its non-unique solutions and the higher dimensionality of the design space, making it challenging to precisely control the resonance wavelength, linewidth, and absorption intensity. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid methodology that integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) (both classical and quantum) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the inverse design of narrow-band absorbing metasurfaces. By introducing a Fano-shaped absorption spectrum equation into the PINN loss function, we enforce physical constraints on the resonance behavior, ensuring outputs that are both spectrally accurate and physically consistent. The study presents a comparison between a conventional GAN + PINN framework and a PINN augmented by a hybrid quantum-classical GAN (QGAN). The findings indicate that the integrated PINN + QGAN model achieves faster convergence, requires 99.5\% fewer training samples, and yields an order of magnitude lower MSE compared to conventional GANs. Remarkably, even though the training dataset only contains metasurfaces with Q-factors on the order of $10^3$, the model is able to generate highly asymmetric metasurface structures with Q-factors exceeding $10^5$. This study presents a novel framework that integrates quantum machine learning with physics-based modeling, providing a promising method for quantum-enhanced inverse design in nanophotonic systems.</description>

Abstract: Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a key performance metric of an imaging instrument. Here we describe characterisation of SNR of a custom 2-photon microscope and compare the SNR performance of our microscope with selected commercial 2-photon microscopes.

      <title>Far-field directionality control of coupled InP nanowire lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanowire (NW) lasers hold great promise as compact, coherent on-chip light sources that are crucial for next-generation optical communication and imaging technologies. However, controlling their emission directionality has been hindered by the complexities of lasing mode engineering and fabrication. Here, we demonstrate spatially-engineered far-field emission from vertically emitting InP NW lasers by establishing precise control over the optical coupling between site-selective NWs, without relying on post-epitaxy transfer and alignment processes. Leveraging this process capability, we design and grow NW pairs and triplets that lase in the TE01 waveguide mode. We then demonstrate the ability to modify their far-field emission profiles from the signature doughnut-like emission to a double-lobed emission profile by changing their optical coupling gap, evidenced by closely matching simulation and experimental profiles. Moreover, through numerical simulations, we show further enhancement in the far-field directionality by arranging the NW laser pairs in a periodic array, demonstrating the feasibility of a directional lasing metasurface. Our results provide a foundation for efficient integration of coherent light generation and beam steering in on-chip light sources.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A preselection-free fiber-optic weak measurement sensing framework is proposed and experimentally verified in this paper. In view of the limitation that fiber-optic weak measurement require specific preselection, this scheme innovates theoretically and achieves high sensitivity sensing by optimizing the post-selection when single-mode optical fiber is used to generate random polarization state. The experimental results show that the sensing performance is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional optical fiber sensing technology.</description>

      <title>Laser micromachining of arbitrarily complex and overhang-free SiN nanomechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on silicon nitride (SiN) nanomechanical resonators produces an exceptionally rich variety of resonator geometries, for which there is currently no available rapid prototyping solution. Experimental advances in nanobeam, trampoline, phononic bandgap, and soft-clamping structures all rely on conventional nanofabrication involving e-beam or photolithography, followed by various etching steps. These techniques are typically time-consuming, relatively inflexible, and often result in spurious residual SiN overhang that can degrade mechanical quality factors. In contrast, recent work has shown that simple resonant structures, such as nanobeams, can be prototyped by direct laser ablation of free-standing SiN membranes using a spatially distributed sequence of microholes that limits stress concentration. However, these early demonstrations were restricted to basic shapes, created by manually combining ablation routines for circles and straight lines. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of arbitrarily complex geometries using an open-source software toolset--released with this publication--that automatically generates laser-ablated hole sequences directly from standard semiconductor layout files (i.e., GDSII). The software includes a layout alignment tool that compensates for the membrane orientation and dimensional variations, limiting material overhang to ~2 um. Using this toolset, we fabricate several resonator geometries, each in under 1 hour, two of which are exhaustively characterized as candidate structures for high-performance radiation sensing. The measured quality factors of these structures closely match finite element simulations and reach values up to 3.7 x 10^6. From these measurements, we extract material quality factors above 3700, which is on par with low-stress SiN unablated plain membranes and with comparable structures produced using conventional fabrication methods.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Direct Ptychography Sampling Requirements via Parallax Imaging Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct ptychography enables the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave passing through a thin sample by deconvolving the interference effect of a converged probe with known aberrations. Under the weak phase object approximation, this permits the optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques. However, the achievable resolution of the technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography and use this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We also demonstrate analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Improving Multislice Electron Ptychography with a Generative Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Anomalous increasing super reflectance in chiral matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic and anomalous Hall conductivities induce anomalous transport features and novel optical phenomena in chiral systems. Here, we investigate reflection properties on the surface of a medium ruled by axion electrodynamics, which effectively describes optical aspects of Weyl semimetals. We show that these chiral media can manifest anomalous reflectance (R greater than unity) for some frequency windows, depending on the signs of the two involved conductivities. Such a reflectance can increase with the frequency, being always greater than 1 in certain frequency bands. We also examine the complex Kerr angles at normal incidence on the chiral medium. Giant Kerr angle is observed within the absorption window, while the Kerr ellipticity may be used to determine the relative sign of the magnetic conductivity.</description>

      <title>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in magnetoelectric materials: The role of optical coefficients in refractive index modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigations into optical phenomena associated with nonlinear magnetoelectric effects are attracting growing attention within the scientific community. Technologies constantly demand new materials capable of exhibiting precise and controllable responses to external electromagnetic fields. In this context, the optics of such materials is of remarkable importance. Here, working in a lossless and non-dispersive regime, electromagnetic wave propagation in materials presenting linear and nonlinear optical coefficients is investigated. We expand the discussion of the roles of nonlinear coefficients by examining special cases in which the contribution of the magnetoelectric optical coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$, $\beta_{ijk}$, and $\gamma_{ijk}$ to birefringence and nonreciprocal phenomena is elucidated. Notably, expressions that directly connect the magnetoelectric coefficients to the refractive indices of the medium are fully derived. These expressions enable the direct measurement of all components of each nonlinear magnetoelectric coefficient, providing an advancement over previous works. This development bridges theoretical models with experimental applications, offering possibilities for the optical characterization of magnetoelectric effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional theoretical model of microparticle-assisted super-resolution imaging, enabling accurate simulation of virtual image formation. The model reveals that accounting for partial spatial coherence of illumination is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving super-resolution. We also propose a novel illumination strategy based on suppressing the normal component of incident light, which enhances image contrast and resolution. The results establish a consistent wave-optical framework that reproduces experimentally observed subwavelength imaging and clarifies the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications ranging from precision acceleration and force sensing to testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which typically require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability of the system. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber equipped with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens allows stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for collecting scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus enabling efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Low-loss terahertz negative curvature suspended-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the design concept of negative curvature hollow-core fibers, this paper presents an innovative negative curvature suspended-core THz fiber. Compared to traditional suspended-core fibers, all structural units of this fiber are designed with circular boundaries, effectively avoiding the issues of insufficient mechanical strength and manufacturing difficulties associated with the wide and ultra-thin rectangular support arms in traditional structures. The numerical simulation using the full-vector finite element method shows that the optical fiber loss is as low as 0.0868dB/cm (0.02cm-1) in 0.4-0.9THz, and the low loss bandwidth is 0.43THz. In addition, by adjusting the structural parameters of the fiber, near zero flat dispersion of -0.15-0.05 ps/THz/cm can be achieved in the range of 0.4-0.9 THz. The fiber exhibits excellent characteristics of low loss, wide bandwidth, and low dispersion, theoretically opening a new research path for the design of low loss THz fibers. This will provide important component support for the application and development of THz technology in fields such as communication, sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Berry monopoles-quantized sources of Berry curvature-are fundamental to topological phases, yet their scattering remains unexplored. Here, we report for the first time the adiabatic scattering of Berry monopoles in a bilayer photonic crystal slab combining one genuine and one synthetic momentum. Two monopoles approach, collide, and scatter within this hybrid parameter space. The process is described by an effective coupled-mode model and confirmed by full-wave simulations. We further propose an experimental scheme using chiral edge states, opening a route to probe monopole interactions in synthetic photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the physics of resonant optical metasurfaces allowed to realize the so-called maximum chirality of planar structures by engineering their geometric parameters. Here we employ bilayer membrane metasurfaces with a square lattice of rotated C$_4$-symmetric holes and uncover very different scenarios of chirality maximization by virtue of strong coupling of photonic eigenmodes of the membranes supplemented by smart engineering of dissipation losses. Our findings substantially expand the class of planar maximally chiral resonant surfaces feasible for widespread nanolithography techniques desired for metaphotonic applications in chiral sensing, chiral light emission, detection and polarization conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the complex frequency fingerprint (CFF), an experimentally accessible method for detecting the complex frequency Green's function (GF). Unlike the real frequency GF, where $\omega$ is real, this complex frequency GF is shown to play a necessary role in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems. For non-Hermitian systems, we will prove that our method detects complex energy spectra, eigenstates, and complex frequency GFs throughout the complex plane, providing necessary identification of the non-Hermitian skin effect. For quantum many-body systems, our method reveals quasiparticle peaks across the complex plane and intuitively illustrates interaction effects. This information is difficult to obtain with real frequency detection. Our method paves the way for exploring exotic phenomena in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems, bridging theory and experiment across diverse physical areas.</description>

      <title>Exact steady state of quantum van der Pol oscillator: critical phenomena and enhanced metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality of open many-body systems has attracted lots of interest for emergent phenomena and universality. Here we present the exact steady state of the quantum van der Pol oscillator using the complex $P$-representation. We show the threshold corresponds to a dissipative phase transition with abrupt changes of steady-state properties and enhanced metrology. The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. Moreover, we obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the larger enhancement of the susceptibility than the standard deviation of the photon number. Our work reveals the underlying relation between the time crystal, dissipative phase transition, and enhanced metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for security analysis against the Trojan-horse attacks (THA) launched to a practical fiber-based quantum key distribution (QKD) system across a wide spectral range. To achieve this, we utilize optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) for the spectral reflectance analysis in the near-infrared range 1100 - 1800 nm with centimeter-level resolution and with a noise floor down to -80 dB. Finally, the total theoretical-security analysis against the THA side channel considering the spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding results are the first of their kind in a wide spectral range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers are widely used as a highly sensitive tool to measure forces on micron-scale particles. One such application is the measurement of the electric charge of a particle, which can be done with high precision in liquids, air, or vacuum. We experimentally investigate how the trapping laser itself can electrically charge such a particle, in our case a $\sim 1\,\mathrm{\mu m\;SiO_2}$ sphere in air. We model the charging mechanism as a two-photon process which reproduces the experimental data with high fidelity.</description>
