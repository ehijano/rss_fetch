      <title>Scaling of Rainfall Intensity and Frequency with Rising Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global warming is projected to intensify the hydrological cycle, amplifying risks to ecosystems and society. While extreme rainfall appears to exhibit stronger sensitivity to global warming compared to mean rainfall rates, a unifying physical mechanism capable of explaining this systematic divergence has remained elusive. Here, we integrate theory and data from a global network of nearly 50,000 rain-gauge stations to unravel the rainfall intensity and frequency response to rising temperatures. We show that the distributions of wet-day rainfall depth exhibit self-similar shapes across diverse geographical regions and time periods. Combined with the temperature response of rainfall frequency, this consistently links mean and extreme precipitation at both local and global scales. We find that the most probable change in rainfall intensity follows Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling with variations shaped by a fundamental hydrological constraint. This behavior reflects a dynamic intensification of updrafts in space and time, which produces localized heavy precipitation events enhancing atmospheric moisture depletion and hydrologic losses through runoff and percolation. The resulting reduction in evaporative fluxes slows the replenishment of atmospheric moisture, giving rise to the observed trade-off between rainfall frequency and intensity. These robust scaling laws for rainfall shifts with temperature are essential for climate projection and adaptation planning.</description>

      <title>Structural Cointegration of the Paleoclimate: Estimating Earth System Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the long-term relationship between atmospheric $CO_2$ and global temperature is fundamental to assessing Earth's climate sensitivity. This study applies a Structural Vector Error Correction Model (SVECM) to paleoclimate records from the EPICA Dome C and Vostok ice cores, spanning the last 800,000 years. By leveraging the statistical property of cointegration, we identify a robust, long-term equilibrium relationship between temperature and log-transformed $CO_2$ concentrations while controlling for orbital forcing ($N60J$). Our results, based on 854 observations, reveal a strong causal link with a long-term coefficient ($\beta$) of 17.30, characterized by a high level of statistical significance ($z = -3.82$). This corresponds to an Earth System Sensitivity (ESS) of approximately 12.0$^\circ$C per doubling of $CO_2$. Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) further demonstrates that $CO_2$ shocks account for approximately 40\% of the long-term temperature variance.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Sea Ice Spectral Albedo to Estimate Under-Ice Transmittance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunlight radiation under snow-covered sea ice obtained from remote sensing could help assess under-ice primary production at pan-Arctic scale. Yet, the current remote sensing methods to estimate sunlight transmittance under sea ice is limited by its reliance on imprecise snow depth products and its inability to sense microstructure-driven variations in snow and ice light scattering properties. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations of radiative transfer, we developed an inversion method relying solely on spectral albedo to estimate transmittance under snow-covered sea ice. The method analyses albedo spectral information to derive the vertically resolved scattering properties of snow and sea ice above the freeboard. Assuming fixed columnar ice physical and optical properties, transmittance is then estimated. At ground level, our spectral albedo inversion method is more precise than the current approaches. We argue this is because it implicitly accounts for the variability in snow scattering properties. This method could significantly improve the satellite estimation of photosynthetically available radiation under sea ice, especially because it does not need snow depth.</description>

      <title>OptFormer: Optical Flow-Guided Attention and Phase Space Reconstruction for SST Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) prediction plays a vital role in climate modeling and disaster forecasting. However, it remains challenging due to its nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and extended prediction horizons. To address this, we propose OptFormer, a novel encoder-decoder model that integrates phase-space reconstruction with a motion-aware attention mechanism guided by optical flow. Unlike conventional attention, our approach leverages inter-frame motion cues to highlight relative changes in the spatial field, allowing the model to focus on dynamic regions and capture long-range temporal dependencies more effectively. Experiments on NOAA SST datasets across multiple spatial scales demonstrate that OptFormer achieves superior performance under a 1:1 training-to-prediction setting, significantly outperforming existing baselines in accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases -- OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite well-meaning scenarios that propose global CO2 emissions will decline presented in every IPCC report since 1988, the trend of global CO2 increase continues without significant change. Even if any individual nation manages to flatten its emissions, what matters is the trajectory of the globe. Together the gulf between climate science and climate economics, plus the urgent need for alternative methods of estimation, provided the incentives for development of our Ocean-Heat-Content (OHC) Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) system.
  To link NOAA damages to climate required creating a carbon consumption model to drive a physics model of climate. How fast could carbon be burned and how much coal, oil and natural gas was reasonably available? A carbon model driving climate meant burning the carbon, and modelling how the earth heated up. We developed this using the most recent best greenhouse gas equations and production models for CO2, CH4, N2O, and halogenated gases. This developed an ocean heat content model for the globe. Each step is validated against Known carbon consumption, CO2, temperature, and ocean heat content. This allows a physics founded model of climate costs to be projected.</description>

      <title>Similarities in the Initiation of Upward Positive and Downward Negative Lightning Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between the "Category A" and "B" pulses associated with the initial continuous current of upward negative leaders, and the "Classical" and "Narrow" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest that similar physical processes may be involved in the early stages of negative leader development in both upward and downward lightning, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Shortwave Absorption Spectra of Alumina Aerosols: Implications for Solar Radiation Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alumina is proposed for Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)-based solar radiation modification due to its presumed ability to scatter sunlight strongly while absorbing weakly. Alumina is assigned negligible solar shortwave absorption in climate models; this assumption is not validated owing to technological challenges in quantifying its weak absorption signals. We report alumina's shortwave imaginary refractive index $k$, a determinant of its absorption strength, using sensitive in situ photoacoustic spectrometry, finding values ranging from $1.4 \times 10^{-4}$ to $1.2 \times 10^{-3}$. Particle-scale electron energy-loss spectroscopy provided independent validation and revealed that the non-ideal absorption arises from oxygen vacancy defects in the alumina's crystal structure. Aerosol chemistry climate model simulations to evaluate shortwave absorption radiative effects revealed insignificant impacts on radiative forcing and stratospheric warming. Our findings indicate that alumina's shortwave absorption, previously reported as a source of uncertainty, is unlikely to affect SAI impact calculations.</description>

      <title>Microscopy system for in situ sea ice structure and biology observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sea ice harbours a rich community of well-adapted microorganisms that inhabit liquid micro-spaces where extreme conditions prevail. Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.</description>
