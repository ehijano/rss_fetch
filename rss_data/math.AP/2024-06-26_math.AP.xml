      <title>The Calder\'on problem on Riemannian surfaces and of minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove two results. The first shows that the Dirichlet-Neumann map of the operator $\Delta_g+q$ on a Riemannian surface can determine its topological, differential, and metric structure. Earlier work of this type assumes a priori that the surface is a planar domain [36] or that the geometry is a priori known [29]. We will then apply this result to study a geometric inverse problem for determining minimal surfaces embedded in $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. In particular we will show that knowledge of the volumes of embedded minimal surfaces determine not only their topological and differential structure but also their Riemannian structure as an embedded hypersurface. Such geometric inverse problems are partially inspired by the physical models proposed by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
  The crucial ingredient in removing the planar domain assumption is the determination of the boundary trace of holomorphic functions from knowledge of the Dirichlet-Neumann map of $\Delta_g +q$. This requires a new type of argument involving Carleman estimates and construction of CGO whose phase functions are not Morse as in the case of [29]. We anticipate that these techniques could be of use for studying other inverse problems in geometry and PDE.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of small data solutions to the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation. While the existence theory has been intensely studied, properties like dispersive estimates for the solutions have not yet been investigated. Here we address this question for the problem with small and localized data, and show that a dispersive estimate for the solution holds globally in time. For the proof of our result we use vector field methods combined with the \emph{testing by wave packets method}, whose implementation in this problem is novel.</description>

      <title>Qualitative analysis on a spatial SIS epidemic model with linear source in advective environments II saturated incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a reaction-diffusion-advection SIS epidemic model with saturated incidence rate and linear source. We study the uniform bounds of parabolic system and some asymptotic behavior of the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, according to which the threshold-type dynamics are given. Furthermore, we show the globally asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium in a special case with a large saturated incidence rate. Meanwhile, we investigate the effects of diffusion, advection, saturation and linear source on the asymptotic profiles of the endemic equilibrium. Our study shows that advection may induce the concentration phenomenon and the disease will be eradicated with small dispersal rate of infected individuals. Moreover, our results also reveal that the linear source can enhance persistence of infectious disease and large saturation can help speed up the elimination of disease.</description>

      <title>$L^p-L^q$ estimates for solutions to the plate equation with mass term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for the linear plate equation with mass term and its applications to semilinear models. For the linear problem we obtain $L^p-L^q$ estimates for the solutions in the full range $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$, and we show that such estimates are optimal. In the sequel, we discuss the global in time existence of solutions to the associated semilinear problem with power nonlinearity $|u|^\alpha$. For low dimension space $n\leq 4$, and assuming $L^1$ regularity on the second datum, we were able to prove global existence for $\alpha&gt; \max\{\alpha_c(n), \tilde\alpha_c(n)\}$ where $\alpha_c = 1+4/n$ and $\tilde \alpha_c = 2+2/n$. However, assuming initial data in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^n)\times L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the presence of the mass term allows us to obtain global in time existence for all $1&lt;\alpha \leq (n+4)/[n-4]_+$. We also show that the latter upper bound is optimal, since we prove that there exist data such that a non-existence result for local weak solutions holds when $\alpha &gt; (n+4)/[n-4]_+$.</description>

      <title>A refined uniqueness result of Leray's problem in an infinite-long pipe with the Navier-slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent paper \cite{LPY2024SCM}, authors proved the existence, uniqueness, regularity and exponential decay property of the solution to the generalized Leray's problem in a distorted infinite-long pipe with the Navier-slip boundary condition, where the friction ratio $\alpha&gt;0$ and the flux $\Phi$ is no bigger than a critical flux $\Phi_0=\frac{C\alpha}{1+\alpha}$.
  In this paper, we consider the generalized Leray's problem with the Navier-slip boundary condition in a straight pipe $\mathcal{D}=\Sigma\times\mathbb{R}$. We show that if the flux of the solution is no larger than a critical value that is independent with $\alpha$, the solution to the problem must be the Poiseuille flow with the given flux. This smallness condition of the flux is weaker compared with the previous result, particularly when the friction ratio is small (close to the total slip Navier boundary condition).
  Our proof relies primarily on a refined gradient estimate of the Poiseuille flow with the Navier-slip boundary condition. Additionally, we provide an exact lower bound of the critical flux $\Phi_0$ for flow in an infinite unit cylindrical pipe. Some discussions on the essential differences between 2D and 3D problems are also given.</description>

      <title>Exact controllability to eigensolutions of the heat equation via bilinear controls on two-dimensional domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact controllability of heat type equations in the presence of bilinear controls have been successfully studied in the recent works [1,3,14] motivated by the numerous application to engineering, neurobiology, chemistry, and life science. Nevertheless, the result has been only achieved for one-dimensional domains due to limit of the existing techniques. In this work, we develop a new strategy to ensure the so-called exact controllability to the eigensolutions of heat-type equations via bilinear control on the two-dimensional domains. The result is implied by the null-controllability of a suitable linearized equation, and the main novelty of the work is the strategy of its proof. First, the null-controllability in a finite dimensional subspace has to be ensured via the solvability of a suitable moment problem. Explicit bounds on the control cost w.r.t. to the dimension of the controlled space are also required. Second, the controllability can be extended to the whole Hilbert space, thanks to the Lebeau-Robbiano-Miller method, when the control cost does not growth too fast w.r.t to the dimension of the finite dimensional subspace. We firstly develop our techniques in the general case when suitable hypotheses on the problem are verified. Afterwards, we apply our procedure to the bilinear heat equation on rectangular domains, and we ensure its exact controllability to the eigensolutions. Finally, we study the controllability issue on the square and we use perturbation theory techniques to deal with the presence of multiple eigenvalues for the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian.</description>

      <title>The equations of extended magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is a fluid plasma model generalizing ideal MHD by taking into account the impact of Hall drift effects and the influence of electron inertial effects. XMHD has a Hamiltonian structure which has received over the past ten years a great deal of attention among physicists, and which is embodied by a non canonical Poisson algebra on an infinite-dimensional phase space. XMHD can alternatively be formulated as a nonlinear evolution equation. Our aim here is to investigate the corresponding Cauchy problem. We consider both incompressible and compressible versions of XMHD with, in the latter case, some additional bulk (fluid) viscosity. In this context, we show that XMHD can be recast as a well-posed symmetric hyperbolic-parabolic system implying pseudo-differential operators of order zero acting as coefficients and source terms. Along these lines, we can solve locally in time the associated initial value problems, with moreover a minimal Sobolev regularity. We also explain the emergence and propagation of inertial waves.</description>

      <title>Uniform stability of the damped wave equation with a confining potential in the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate trend to equilibrium for the damped wave equation with a confining potential in the Euclidean space. We provide with necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for the energy to decay exponentially uniformly. The proofs rely on tools from semiclassical analysis together with the construction of quasimodes of the damped wave operator. In addition to the Geometric Control Condition, which is familiar in the context of compact Riemannian manifolds, our work involves a new geometric condition due to the presence of turning points in the underlying classical dynamics which rules the propagation of waves in the high-energy asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Qualitative/quantitative homogenization of some non-Newtonian flows in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the homogenization of stationary and evolutionary incompressible viscous non-Newtonian flows of Carreau-Yasuda type in domains perforated with a large number of periodically distributed small holes in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the mutual distance between the holes is measured by a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and the size of the holes is $\varepsilon^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, \frac 32)$. The Darcy's law is recovered in the limit, thus generalizing the results from [\url{https://doi.org/10.1016/0362-546X(94)00285-P}] and [\url{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.05121}] for $\alpha=1$. Instead of using their restriction operator to derive the estimates of the pressure extension by duality, we use the Bogovski\u{\i} type operator in perforated domains (constructed in [\url{https://doi.org/10.1051/cocv/2016016}]) to deduce the uniform estimates of the pressure directly. Moreover, quantitative convergence rates are given.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves in reaction-diffusion-convection equations with combustion nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence and properties of traveling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion-convection equations on the real line. We consider a general diffusion term involving the $p$-Laplacian and combustion-type reaction term. We extend and generalize the results established for $p=2$ to the case of singular and degenerate diffusion. Our approach allows for non-Lipschitz reaction as well. We also discuss the shape of the traveling wave profile near equilibria, assuming power-type behavior of the reaction and diffusion terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a three-dimensional bounded domain $\Omega$ we consider the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a barotropic fluid with general non-linear density dependent viscosities and no-slip boundary conditions. A nonlinear drag term is added to the momentum equation. We establish two conditional Kato-type criteria for the convergence of the weak solutions to such a system towards the strong solution of the compressible Euler system when the viscosity coefficient and the drag term parameter tend to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of multi-speed solitary waves for the one-dimensional good Boussinesq equation with a power nonlinearity is proven. These solutions are shown to behave at large times as a pair of scalar solitary waves traveling at different speeds. Both subcritical and supercritical cases are treated. The proof is based on the construction of approximations of the multi-speed solitary waves by solving an equivalent system backward in time and using energy methods to obtain uniform estimates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of waves by a penetrable inclusion embedded in some reference medium. We exhibit examples of materials and geometries for which non-scattering frequencies exist, i.e., for which at some frequencies there are incident fields which produce null scattered fields outside of the inhomogeneity. We show in particular that certain domains with corners or even cusps can support non-scattering frequencies. We relate the latter, for some inclusions, to resonance frequencies for Dirichlet or Neumann cavities. We also find situations where incident non-scattering fields solve the Helmholtz equation in a neighborhood of the inhomogeneity and not in the whole space. Finally, in relation with invisibility, we give examples of inclusions of anisotropic materials which are non-scattering for all real frequencies. We prove that corresponding material indices must have a special structure on the boundary.</description>

      <title>On the chaotic behavior of the Lagrangian flow of the 2D Navier-Stokes system with bounded degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a fluid governed by the randomly forced 2D Navier-Stokes system. It is assumed that the force is bounded, acts directly only on a small number of Fourier modes, and satisfies some natural decomposability and observability properties. Under these assumptions, we show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the random fluid exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by the strict positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent. To achieve this, we introduce a new abstract result that allows to derive positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent from controllability properties of the underlying deterministic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hartree-Fock equation in 1D, for a small and localised initial data and a finite measure potential. We show that there is no long range scattering due to a nonlinear cancellation between the direct term and the exchange term for plane waves. We employ the framework of space-time resonances that enables us to single out precisely this cancellation and to obtain scattering to linear waves as a consequence.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to establish the most essential connections of the eigenvalue problems for the Laplace operator, Lam\'{e} operator, Stokes operator, buckling operator and clamped plate operator. We show that the $k$-th Stokes (respectively, Laplace) eigenvalue is the limit of the $k$-th Lam\'{e} eigenvalue for the Dirichlet or traction boundary condition as the Lam\'{e} coefficient $\lambda$ tends to $+\infty$ (respectively, to $-\mu$). Furthermore, we establish the eigenvalue inequalities and three-term asymptotic formulas of the heat traces for the Laplace operator, the Lam\'{e} operator, the Stokes operator and buckling operator with the Dirichlet and traction boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed study of the spectral properties of the linear operator $H(\varepsilon)=-(\varepsilon^{2}\chi_{\Omega_{\varepsilon}}+\chi_{\Omega^{c}_{\varepsilon}})\Delta$ modeling, through the wave equation $(\partial_{tt}+H(\varepsilon))u=0$, the dynamics of acoustic waves in the presence of a small inhomogeneity of size $\varepsilon$ having high contrast $\varepsilon^{-2}$. In particular, we give precise results on the localization of the resonances of $H(\varepsilon)$ and their first-order $\varepsilon$-expansions; the latter are explicitly expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Newton potential operator of the set $\Omega$ whose rescaling of size $\varepsilon$ defines $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the sinh-Gordon equation on graphs. We introduce a uniform a priori estimate to define the topological degree for this equation with nonzero prescribed functions on finite, connected and symmetric graphs. Furthermore, we calculate this topological degree case by case and show several existence results. In particular, we prove that the classical sinh-Gordon equation with nonzero prescribed function is always solvable on such graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of recurrence and transience for graphs over non-Archimedean ordered field. To do so we relate these graphs to random walks of directed graphs over the reals. In particular, we give a characterization of the real directed graphs which can arise is such a way. As a main result, we give characterization for recurrence and transience in terms of a quantity related to the capacity.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality and Decay of $p$-Hardy Weights on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct optimal Hardy weights to subcritical energy functionals $h$ associated with quasilinear Schr\"odinger operators on locally finite graphs. Here, optimality means that the weight $w$ is the largest possible with respect to a partial ordering, and that the corresponding shifted energy functional $h-w$ is null-critical. Moreover, we show a decay condition of Hardy weights in terms of their integrability with respect to certain integral weights. As an application of the decay condition, we show that null-criticality implies optimality near infinity. We also briefly discuss an uncertainty-type principle and a Rellich-type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces.</description>

Abstract: We consider a curve with boundary points free to move on a line in $\mathbb R^2$, which evolves by the $L^2$--gradient flow of the elastic energy, that is a linear combination of the Willmore and the length functional. For such planar evolution problem we study the short and long--time existence.
  Once we establish under which boundary conditions the PDE's system is well--posed (in our case the Navier boundary conditions), employing the Solonnikov theory for linear parabolic systems in H\"older space, we show that there exists a unique flow in a maximal time interval $[0,T)$. Then, using energy methods we prove that the maximal time is actually $T= + \infty$.</description>

      <title>Mean-Square Exponential Stabilization of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control of mixed-autonomy traffic where Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) coexist on the road has gained increasing attention over the recent decades. This paper addresses the boundary stabilization problem for mixed traffic on freeways. The traffic dynamics are described by uncertain coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with Markov jumping parameters, which aim to address the distinctive driving strategies between AVs and HVs. Considering that the spacing policies of AVs vary in mixed traffic, the stochastic impact area of AVs is governed by a continuous Markov chain. The interactions between HVs and AVs such as overtaking or lane changing are mainly induced by impact areas. Using backstepping design, we develop a full-state feedback boundary control law to stabilize the deterministic system (nominal system). Applying Lyapunov analysis, we demonstrate that the nominal backstepping control law is able to stabilize the traffic system with Markov jumping parameters, provided the nominal parameters are sufficiently close to the stochastic ones on average. The mean-square exponential stability conditions are derived, and the results are validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Talbot Effect for the Manakov System on the Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the Talbot effect for the multi-component linear and nonlinear systems of the dispersive evolution equations on a bounded interval subject to periodic boundary conditions and discontinuous initial profiles is investigated. Firstly, for a class of two-component linear systems satisfying the dispersive quantization conditions, we discuss the fractal solutions at irrational times. Next, the investigation to nonlinear regime is extended, we prove that, for the concrete example of the Manakov system, the solutions of the corresponding periodic initial-boundary value problem subject to initial data of bounded variation are continuous but nowhere differentiable fractal-like curve with Minkowski dimension 3/2 at irrational times. Finally, numerical experiments for the periodic initial-boundary value problem of the Manakov system, are used to justify how such effects persist into the multi-component nonlinear regime. Furthermore, it is shown in the nonlinear multi-component regime that the interplay of different components may induce subtle different qualitative profile between the jump discontinuities, especially in the case that two nonlinearly coupled components start with different initial profile.</description>

Abstract: We consider the solutions $\rho_\varepsilon, \mathbf{u}_\varepsilon$ to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in a domain periodically perforated by holes of diameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We focus on the case where the diameter of the holes is of the same order as the distance between neighboring holes. This is the same setting investigated in the paper by Masmoudi [\url{http://www.numdam.org/article/COCV_2002__8__885_0.pdf}], where convergence $\rho_\varepsilon, \mathbf{u}_\varepsilon$ of the system to the porous medium equation has been shown. We prove a quantitative version of this convergence result provided that the solution of the limiting system is sufficiently regular. The proof builds on the relative energy inequality satisfied by the compressible NSE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider strictly positive solutions to a class of fourth-order conservative quasilinear SPDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus modeled after the stochastic thin-film equation. We prove local Lipschitz estimates in Bessel potential spaces under minimal assumptions on the parameters and corresponding stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimates for thin-film type operators with measurable in-time coefficients. As a result, we deduce local well-posedness of the stochastic thin-film equation as well as blow-up criteria and instantaneous regularization for the solution. In dimension one, we additionally close $\alpha$-entropy estimates and subsequently an energy estimate for the stochastic thin-film equation with an interface potential so that global well-posedness follows. We allow for a wide range of mobility functions including the power laws $u^n$ for $n\in [0,6)$ as long as the interface potential is sufficiently repulsive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharp lower and upper uniform estimates are obtained for fundamental frequencies of $p$-Laplace type operators generated by quadratic forms. Optimal constants are exhibited, rigidity of the upper estimate is proved, anisotropic attainability of the lower estimate is derived as well as characterization of anisotropic extremizers for circular and rectangular membranes. Sharp quantitative anisotropic inequalities associated with lower constants are also established, providing as a by-product information on anisotropic stability. When the uniform ellipticity condition is relaxed, we show that the optimal lower constant remains positive, while anisotropic extremizers no longer exist. Our sharp lower estimate can be viewed as an isoanisotropic counterpart of the Faber-Krahn isoperimetric inequality in the plane.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the validity of the Phragm\`en-Lindel\"of principle for a class of elliptic equations with a potential, posed on infinite graphs. Consequently, we get uniqueness, in the class of solutions satisfying a suitable growth condition at infinity. We suppose that the {\it outer degree (or outer curvature)} of the graph is bounded from above, and we allow the potential to go to zero at infinity in a controlled way. Finally, we discuss the optimality of the conditions on the potential and on the outer degree on special graphs.</description>

  We investigate and arrive at the existence of smooth solution to the (p,q)-Christoffel-Minkowski problem by a type of expanding curvature flow. Furthermore, the uniqueness result of solutions to the (p,q)-Christoffel-Minkowski problem shall be discussed.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e--Sobolev Inequalities Based on Choquet--Lorentz Integrals with Respect to Hausdorff Contents on Bounded John Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded John domain in $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\ge 2$, and let $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in (0,n]$. In this article, the authors prove the Poincar\'e and the Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities on Choquet--Lorentz integrals with respect to $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ for all continuously differentiable functions on $\Omega$. These results not only extend the recent Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities, obtained by Harjulehto and Hurri-Syrj\"{a}nen in [J. Funct. Anal. 284 (2023), Paper No. 109862], to the Choquet--Lorentz integrals, but also provide some endpoint estimates (weak type) of their results in the critical case. One of the main novelties exists in that, to achieve the goals, the authors develop some new tools associated with Choquet--Lorentz integrals on $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$, such as the fractional Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequality and the Hedberg-type pointwise estimate on the Riesz potential. As an application, the sharp boundedness of the Riesz potential on Choquet--Lorentz integrals is obtained. Moreover, even for classical Lorentz integrals, these Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities are also new.</description>

      <title>Breaking Consensus in Kinetic Opinion Formation Models on Graphons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system towards a declustered state.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of the characteristic initial-boundary value problem for the Einstein equations in Bondi-like coordinates (including Bondi, double-null and affine). We propose a definition of strong hyperbolicity of a system of partial differential equations of any order, and show that the Einstein equations in Bondi-like coordinates in their second-order form used in numerical relativity do not meet it, in agreement with results of Giannakopoulos et al for specific first-order reductions. In the principal part, frozen coefficient approximation that one uses to examine hyperbolicity, we explicitly construct the general solution to identify the solutions that obstruct strong hyperbolicity. Independently, we present a first-order symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein equations in Bondi gauge, linearised about Schwarzschild, thus completing work by Frittelli. This establishes an energy norm ($L^2$ in the metric perturbations and selected first and second derivatives), in which the initial-boundary value problem, with initial data on an outgoing null cone and boundary data on a timelike cylinder or an ingoing null cone, is well-posed, thus verifying a conjecture by Giannakopoulos et al. Unfortunately, our method does not extend to the pure initial-value problem on a null cone with regular vertex.</description>

Abstract: We argue that the spatial discretization of the strongly nonlinear Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation defines a nonlinear lattice that is physically relevant in the context of the nonlinear physics of ecosystems, modelling the dynamics of vegetation densities in dry lands. We study the system in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is especially relevant because of its natural dimension for the emergence of pattern formation. Theoretical results identify parametric regimes for the system that distinguish between extinction and potential convergence to non-trivial states. Importantly, we analytically identify conditions for Turing instability, detecting thresholds on the discretization parameter for the manifestation of this mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal the sharpness of the analytical conditions for instability and illustrate the rich potential for pattern formation even in the strongly discrete regime, emphasizing the importance of the interplay between higher dimensionality and discreteness.</description>
