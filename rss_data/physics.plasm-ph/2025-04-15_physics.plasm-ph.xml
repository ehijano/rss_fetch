      <title>Overcoming Discharge Inhibition in n-Butane Oxidation: Two-Component BaTiO3 and Mn-Cu Mixed Oxide Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A twin surface dielectric barrier discharge on the microsecond scale was used in combination with a two-component coating to oxidize 300 ppm n-butane as a model volatile organic compound to CO2 and H2O in synthetic air at room temperature and at 160 {\deg}C. The integration of BaTiO3 as a base material for the coating allowed the successful use of otherwise discharge-ignition-inhibiting materials such as MnO2-CuO applied as a full coating. Application of pure BaTiO3 led to highly porous coatings that do not hinder the discharge ignition and show a negligible influence on n-butane conversion while reducing byproduct formation. Thus, BaTiO3 was identified as a suitable structure-directing agent in two-component coatings, using 1:1 and 1:2 ratios of BaTiO3:catalyst coatings. Coated electrode configurations were compared to their respective uncoated state to highlight the coating-induced changes. The two-component coatings strongly increased the CO2 selectivity, reaching a maximum of 91.6 % at an energy density of 450 J/L and 160 {\deg}C for the 1:2 ratio, corresponding to an increase of 51.0 % relative to the uncoated electrode.</description>

      <title>Direct Comparison of Gyrokinetic and Fluid Scrape-Off Layer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, fluid simulations are used for tokamak divertor design. However, fluid models are only valid if the SOL is highly collisional, an assumption that is valid in many present day experiments but is questionable in the high-power scenarios envisioned for burning plasmas and fusion pilot plants. This paper reports on comparisons between fluid and kinetic simulations of the scrape off layer (SOL) for parameters and geometry representative of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) fusion pilot plant. The SOLPS-ITER (fluid) and Gkeyll (gyrokinetic) codes are operated in a two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric mode, which replaces turbulence with ad-hoc diffusivities. In kinetic simulations, we observe that the ions in the upstream SOL experience significant mirror trapping. This substantially increases the upstream temperature and has important implications for impurity dynamics. We show that the mirror force, which is excluded in SOLPS's form of fluid equations, enhances the electrostatic potential drop along the field line in the SOL. We also show that the assumption of equal main ion and impurity temperatures, which is made in commonly used fluid codes, is invalid. The combination of these effects results in superior confinement of impurities to the divertor region in kinetic simulations, consistent with our earlier predictions. This effect can be dramatic, reducing the midplane impurity density by orders of magnitude. These results indicate that in reactor-like regimes the tolerable downstream impurity densities may be higher than would be predicted by fluid simulations, allowing for higher radiated power while avoiding unacceptable core contamination. Our results highlight the importance of kinetic simulations for divertor design and optimization for fusion pilot plants.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal effects on Thermal Transport in MagLIF-Relevant Gaspipes on NIF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulations of heat flow relevant to gaspipe experiments on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to investigate kinetic effects on transport phenomena. D2 and neopentane (C5H12) filled targets are used to study the laser preheat stage of a MagLIF scheme where anaxial magnetic field is sometimes applied to the target. Simulations were done with the radiation-MHD code HYDRA with a collision-dominated fluid model and the Schurtz nonlocal electron thermal conduction model. Using the Schurtz model to evolve the electron temperature increased the heat front propagation of neopentane gas targets compared to a local model by limiting radial heat flow. This increases electron temperature near the axis, which decreases laser absorption. We find the effect of heat flow models on temperature profiles and laser propagation is modest. Beyond the Schurtz model, we utilize HYDRA to initialize plasma conditions for the Vlasov Fokker-Planck K2 code. We run K2 until a quasi-steady state is reached and examine the impact of kinetic effects on heat transport. Although axial heat flow is well predicted by fluid models, the fluid model consistently over predicts radial heat flow up to 150% in regions with the largest temperature gradient of D2 filled gaspipes. On the other hand, the Schurtz nonlocal electron conduction model is found to be adequate for capturing kinetic heat flow in gaspipes.</description>

      <title>Conservative data-driven model order reduction of a fluid-kinetic spectral solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations are computationally intensive due to six-dimensional phase space discretization. Many kinetic spectral solvers use the asymmetrically weighted Hermite expansion due to its conservation and fluid-kinetic coupling properties, i.e., the lower-order Hermite moments capture and describe the macroscopic fluid dynamics and higher-order Hermite moments describe the microscopic kinetic dynamics. We leverage this structure by developing a parametric data-driven reduced-order model based on the proper orthogonal decomposition, which projects the higher-order kinetic moments while retaining the fluid moments intact. This approach can also be understood as learning a nonlocal closure via a reduced modal decomposition. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the method ensures local and global mass, momentum, and energy conservation. The numerical results show that the proposed method effectively replicates the high-dimensional spectral simulations at a fraction of the computational cost and memory, as validated on the weak Landau damping and two-stream instability benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Theory of zonal flow growth and propagation in toroidal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The toroidal geometry of tokamaks and stellarators is known to play a crucial role in the linear physics of zonal flows, leading to e.g. the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual and geodesic acoustic modes. However, descriptions of the nonlinear zonal flow growth from a turbulent background typically resort to simplified models of the geometry. We present a generalised theory of the secondary instability to model the zonal flow growth from turbulent fluctuations in toroidal geometry, demonstrating that the radial magnetic drift substantially affects the nonlinear zonal flow dynamics. In particular, the toroidicity gives rise to a new branch of propagating zonal flows, the toroidal secondary mode, which is nonlinearly supported by the turbulence. We present a theory of this mode and compare the theory against gyrokinetic simulations of the secondary mode. The connection with other secondary modes - the ion-temperature-gradient and Rogers-Dorland-Kotschenreuther secondary modes - is also examined.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Fusion in D-${}^{3}$He Plasmas With Spin-Polarized Fuel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized fuel (SPF) is recognized for enhancing fusion reactivity, but it could provide other advantages particularly relevant to advanced fusion fuels. In this work, we calculate how SPF in D-${}^3$He plasmas affects not only D-${}^3$He fusion reactions but D-D fusion and subsequent secondary reactions. By incorporating multiple effects, we show how, under optimistic assumptions, the fusion power relative to unpolarized D-${}^3$He fusion power could increase by more than a factor of three by polarizing the deuterium and helium-3. Such an increase may increase the feasibility of fusion concepts using D-${}^3$He fuel. We perform a case study with a hypothetical pulsed magneto-inertial fusion device using polarized D-${}^3$He fuel, showing how the net electric power could increase by almost an order of magnitude. We also consider the potential of SPF to provide a path to fully aneutronic fusion. This work is a new look at how SPF could improve the feasibility of fusion concepts using advanced fuels.</description>

      <title>Why Cold BGK Modes Are So Cool: Dispersion Relations from Orbit-Constrained Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytic dispersion relations for cold, orbitally constrained systems governed by the Vlasov equation. For magnetized plasmas, we obtain the first explicit relation for two-dimensional anisotropic BGK modes with finite magnetic field, showing that only a finite number of angular modes can become unstable and identifying a magnetic-field threshold for stabilization. In the gravitational case, we establish a bound on the growth rate of core perturbations, set by the potential's curvature. These results clarify how orbital constraints shape the spectrum and growth of kinetic instabilities in cold, collisionless media.</description>

      <title>The response of warm absorbers to the variations in the ionizing continuum in the active galaxy NGC4051</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response of warm absorbers to variations in the ionizing continuum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using time-resolved X-ray observations from the \textit{Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer} (\textit{NICER}). In this work, we have demonstrated we can perform time-resolved spectroscopic studies of warm absorbers of about $\sim 5500$ s time resolution using NICER data. We have extracted 15 spectra for this source, corresponding to 15 different visits to the source, or pointings, each separated by a longer Earth occultation. By modeling the spectral variability of the warm absorber with the \texttt{{\sc {\sc warmabs}}} analytic model, we detect significant variations in the ionization parameter that correlate with changes in the ionizing flux. A time lag of approximately 5500 seconds is observed between the flux variations and the absorber's ionization response, suggesting that the gas is out of photoionization equilibrium during these periods. Using this time lag, we estimate the lower limit of the gas density $8.91 \times 10^6 \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ and constrain the location of the warm absorber to within $7.02 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}$ ($\sim 0.02$ parsec) from the central black hole. This study uses time-resolved spectral analysis to contribute to our understanding of the physical conditions of ionized AGN outflows, such as density and location.</description>

      <title>Drift-cyclotron loss-cone instability in 3D simulations of a sloshing-ion simple mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetic stability of collisionless, sloshing beam-ion (45{\deg} pitch angle) plasma is studied in a 3D simple magnetic mirror, mimicking the Wisconsin High-temperature superconductor Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM) experiment. The collisional Fokker-Planck code CQL3D-m provides a slowing-down beam-ion distribution to initialize the kinetic-ion/fluid-electron code Hybrid-VPIC, which then simulates free plasma decay without external heating or fueling. Over 1-10 $\mu$s, drift-cyclotron loss-cone (DCLC) modes grow and saturate in amplitude. DCLC scatters ions to a marginally-stable distribution with gas-dynamic rather than classical-mirror confinement. Sloshing ions can trap cool (low-energy) ions in an electrostatic potential well to stabilize DCLC, but DCLC itself does not scatter sloshing beam-ions into said well. Instead, cool ions must come from external sources such as charge-exchange collisions with a low-density neutral population. Manually adding cool ~1 keV ions improves beam-ion confinement several-fold in Hybrid-VPIC simulations, which qualitatively corroborates prior measurements from real mirror devices with sloshing ions.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Fusion Reactivity in Laser-Driven $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the averaged fusion reactivity of the $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ reaction in tabletop laser experiments using a plasma expansion model. We investigate the energy distribution of proton beams accelerated by lasers as a function of electron temperature $T_e$ and the dimensionless acceleration time $\omega_{pi} t_{\rm acc}$, where $\omega_{pi}$ is the ion plasma frequency. By combining these distributions with the fusion cross-section, we identify the optimal conditions that maximize the fusion reactivity, with $\left\langle \sigma v \right\rangle = 8.12 \times 10^{-16}\,{\rm cm^3/s}$ at $k_B T_e = 10.0\,{\rm MeV}$ and $\omega_{pi} t_{\rm acc} = 0.503$. These findings suggest that an upper limit exists for the fusion reactivity achievable in laser-driven $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ fusion experiments, even under optimized conditions.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively distinct turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second, the 'low-$\beta$ state,' which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim 1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress ($\alpha \sim 1$). The low-$\beta$ state emerges in simulations initialized with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this holds true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta \ll 1$, provided the thermal scale height of the disk is well resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we identify may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work, including the implications of our results for global accretion disk models and simulations.</description>
