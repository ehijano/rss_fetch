      <title>From Intention To Implementation: Automating Biomedical Research via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.</description>

      <title>On the Tractability Landscape of Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the Conditional Approval Framework for elections involving multiple interdependent issues, specifically focusing on the Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of this rule, demonstrating that no approach can significantly outperform the brute-force algorithm under common computational complexity assumptions and various natural input restrictions. In response, we propose two practical restrictions (the first in the literature) that make the problem computationally tractable and show that these restrictions are essentially tight. Overall, this work provides a clear picture of the tractability landscape of the problem, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the complications introduced by conditional ballots and indicating that conditional approval voting can be applied in practice, albeit under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Uncommon Belief in Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common knowledge/belief in rationality is the traditional standard assumption in analysing interaction among agents. This paper proposes a graph-based language for capturing significantly more complicated structures of higher-order beliefs that agents might have about the rationality of the other agents. The two main contributions are a solution concept that captures the reasoning process based on a given belief structure and an efficient algorithm for compressing any belief structure into a unique minimal form.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.</description>
