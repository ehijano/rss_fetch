      <title>QubitSwap: The Informational Edge in Decentralised Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralised exchanges (DEXs) have transformed trading by enabling trustless, permissionless transactions, yet they face significant challenges such as impermanent loss and slippage, which undermine profitability for liquidity providers and traders. In this paper, we introduce QubitSwap, an innovative DEX model designed to tackle these issues through a hybrid approach that integrates an external oracle price with internal pool dynamics. This is achieved via a parameter $z$, which governs the balance between these price sources, creating a flexible and adaptive pricing mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we derive a novel reserve function and pricing model that substantially reduces impermanent loss and slippage compared to traditional DEX frameworks. Notably, our results show that as $z$ approaches 1, slippage approaches zero, enhancing trading stability. QubitSwap marks a novel approach in DEX design, delivering a more efficient and resilient platform. This work not only advances the theoretical foundations of decentralised finance but also provides actionable solutions for the broader DeFi ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Execution and Macroscopic Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic game modelling the strategic interaction between market makers and traders of optimal execution type. For traders, the permanent price impact commonly attributed to them is replaced by quoting strategies implemented by market makers. For market makers, order flows become endogenous, driven by tactical traders rather than assumed exogenously. Using the forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) characterization of Nash equilibria, we establish a local well-posedness result for the general game. In the specific Almgren-Chriss-Avellaneda-Stoikov model, a decoupling approach guarantees the global well-posedness of the FBSDE system via the well-posedness of an associated backward stochastic Riccati equation. Finally, by introducing small diffusion terms into the inventory processes, global well-posedness is achieved for the approximation game.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</description>
