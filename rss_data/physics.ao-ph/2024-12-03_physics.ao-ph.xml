      <title>Smoothing of global fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the forecast diagnostic and verification community, there exists a need for smoothing methods that would work in the global domain. For limited-area domains, fast smoothing methods already exist, but the problem is that these approaches cannot be used with global fields as a global grid defined on a sphere is inherently non-equidistant and/or irregular. Another potential issue is the variability of grid point area sizes and the presence of missing data in the field, which can also be problematic to deal with for existing smoothing methods. Here, we present two new approaches for area-size-informed smoothing on a sphere. The first approach is based on k-d trees, and the second one is based on overlap detection. While each has its strengths and weaknesses, both are potentially fast enough to make the smoothing of high-resolution global fields feasible, as demonstrated by the smoothing of an operational global high-resolution precipitation forecast from the Integrated Forecasting System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Both approaches can also handle missing data in an appropriate manner and can also be used in non-rectangularly-shaped limited-area domains defined on non-equidistant and/or irregular grids.</description>

      <title>Local and Regional Contributions to Tropospheric Ozone Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone according to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone formation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as the sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and ozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ species in the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited. Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in generating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or regional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of precursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone concentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local precursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations are analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional and local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to determine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether the region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the oxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a 10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah were found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties being either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local contributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake Counties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington, and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant concentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional and local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was found to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime to be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-Enforced Neural Networks (JENN) for Improved Data Assimilation Consistency in Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based weather models have shown great promise in producing accurate forecasts but have struggled when applied to data assimilation tasks, unlike traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This study introduces the Jacobian-Enforced Neural Network (JENN) framework, designed to enhance DA consistency in neural network (NN)-emulated dynamical systems. Using the Lorenz 96 model as an example, the approach demonstrates improved applicability of NNs in DA through explicit enforcement of Jacobian relationships. The NN architecture includes an input layer of 40 neurons, two hidden layers with 256 units each employing hyperbolic tangent activation functions, and an output layer of 40 neurons without activation.
  The JENN framework employs a two-step training process: an initial phase using standard prediction-label pairs to establish baseline forecast capability, followed by a secondary phase incorporating a customized loss function to enforce accurate Jacobian relationships. This loss function combines root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted and true state values with additional RMSE terms for tangent linear (TL) and adjoint (AD) emulation results, weighted to balance forecast accuracy and Jacobian sensitivity. To ensure consistency, the secondary training phase uses additional pairs of TL/AD inputs and labels calculated from the physical models. Notably, this approach does not require starting from scratch or structural modifications to the NN, making it readily applicable to pretrained models such as GraphCast, NeuralGCM, Pangu, or FuXi, facilitating their adaptation for DA tasks with minimal reconfiguration. Experimental results demonstrate that the JENN framework preserves nonlinear forecast performance while significantly reducing noise in the TL and AD components, as well as in the overall Jacobian matrix.</description>

      <title>Empirical model of SSUSI-derived auroral ionization rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an empirical model for auroral (90--150 km) electron--ion pair production rates, ionization rates for short, derived from SSUSI (Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager) electron energy and flux data. Using the Fang et al., 2010 parametrization for mono-energetic electrons, and the NRLMSISE-00 neutral atmosphere model, the calculated ionization rate profiles are binned in 2-h magnetic local time (MLT) and 3.6$^{\circ}$ geomagnetic latitude to yield time series of ionization rates at 5-km altitude steps. We fit each of these time series to the geomagnetic indices Kp, PC, and Ap, the 81-day averaged solar F$_{\text{10.7}}$ radio flux index, and a constant term. The resulting empirical model can easily be incorporated into coupled chemistry--climate models to include particle precipitation effects.</description>

      <title>Using rare event algorithms to understand the statistics and dynamics of extreme heatwave seasons in South Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the return times of extreme events and assessing the impact of climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes this task a challenging one, even more so for "record-shattering" events that have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons, corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave seasons. This innovative approach could be used in extreme event attribution studies to better constrain the changes in event's probability and intensity with global warming, particularly for events with return times spanning centuries or millennia.</description>

      <title>The future of offshore wind power production: wake and climate impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid deployment of offshore wind is expected within the coming decades to help meet climate goals. With offshore wind turbine lifetimes of 25-30 years, and new offshore leases spanning 60 years, it is vital to consider long-term changes in potential wind power resource at the farm planning stage. Such changes may arise from multiple sources, including climate change, and increasing wake-induced power losses. In this work, we investigate and compare these two sources of long-term change in wind power, for a case study consisting of 21 wind farms within the German Bight. Consistent with previous studies, we find a small but significant reduction in wind resource due to climate change by the end of the 21st century under the high-emission RCP8.5 scenario, compared with a historical period, with a mean power reduction (over an ensemble of seven climate models) of 2.1%. To assess the impact of wake-induced losses due to increasingly dense farm build-out, we model wakes within the German Bight region using an engineering wake model, under various stages of (planned) build-out corresponding to the years 2010-2027. By identifying clusters of wind farms, we decompose wake effects into long-range (inter-cluster), medium-range (intra-cluster) and short-range (intra-farm) effects. Inter-cluster wake-induced losses increase from 0 for the 2010 scenario to 2.5% for the 2027 scenario, with intra-cluster losses also increasing from 0 to 4.3%. Intra-farm losses are relatively constant, at around 13%. While the evolution of wake effects therefore outweighs the climate effect, and impacts over a shorter timescale, both factors are significant. We also find evidence of an interaction between the climate and wake effects. Both climate change and evolving wake effects must therefore be considered within resource assessment and wind farm planning.</description>

      <title>Alternators For Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and often outperform strong baselines such as Mambas, neural ODEs, and diffusion models in the domains we studied.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Turbulence Producing Motions in the ABL Across a Natural Roughness Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landforms such as sand dunes act as roughness elements to Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows, triggering the development of new scales of turbulent motions. These turbulent motions, in turn, energize and kick-up sand particles, influencing sediment transport and ultimately the formation and migration of dunes -- with knock on consequences for dust emission. While feedbacks between flow and form have been studied at the scale of dunes, research has not examined how the development of an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) over the entire dune field influences sediment-transporting turbulence. Here, we deploy large-eddy simulation of an ABL encountering a natural roughness transition: the sand dunes at White Sands National Park, New Mexico. We analyze turbulence producing motions and how they change as the IBL grows over the dune field. Frequency spectrum and Reynolds shear stress profiles show that IBL thickness determines the largest scales of turbulence. More, the developing IBL enhances the frequency, magnitude and duration of sweep and ejection events -- turbulence producing motions whose peaks systematically migrate away from the wall as the IBL thickens. Because sweep and ejection events are known to drive sediment transport, our findings provide a mechanism for coupling the co-evolution of the landscape and the ABL flow over it. More broadly, our results have implications for how roughness transitions influence the transport of pollutants, particulates, heat, and moisture.</description>
