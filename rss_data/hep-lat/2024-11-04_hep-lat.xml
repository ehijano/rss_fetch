      <title>Efficient State Preparation for the Schwinger Model with a Theta Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison of different quantum state preparation algorithms and their overall efficiency for the Schwinger model with a theta term. While adiabatic state preparation (ASP) is proved to be effective, in practice it leads to large CNOT gate counts to prepare the ground state. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) provides excellent results while keeping the CNOT counts small by design, at the cost of an expensive classical minimization process. We introduce a ``blocked'' modification of the Schwinger Hamiltonian to be used in the QAOA that further decreases the length of the algorithms as the size of the problem is increased. The rodeo algorithm (RA) provides a powerful tool to efficiently prepare any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, as long as its overlap with the initial guess is large enough. We obtain the best results when combining the blocked QAOA ansatz and the RA, as this provides an excellent initial state with a relatively short algorithm without the need to perform any classical steps for large problem sizes.</description>

      <title>$\theta$ dependence of $T_c$ in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the $\theta$ dependence of the confinement-deconfinement transition temperature $T_c$ for the 4d SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory. We perform lattice numerical simulations on three spatial sizes $N_S=24$, $32$, $48$ with a fixed temporal size $N_T=8$. We introduce a non-zero $\theta$-angle by the re-weighting method, which is combined with the sub-volume method to mitigate the sign problem. By taking advantage of the universality in the second order phase transition and the Binder cumulant of the order parameter, the $\theta$-dependence of $T_c$ is determined to be $T_c(\theta)/T_c(0)=1-0.016(3)\,\theta^2+O(\theta^4)$. We point out that the temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility should exhibit a singularity with the exponent for the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ pure-gauge theory from out-of-equilibrium simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \textit{JHEP} \textbf{04} (2024) 126 [arXiv:2402.06561] we recently proposed an out-of-equilibrium setup to reduce the large auto-correlations of the topological charge in two-dimensional $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ models. Our proposal consists of performing open-boundaries simulations at equilibrium, and gradually switching on periodic boundary conditions out-of-equilibrium. Our setup allows to exploit the reduced auto-correlations achieved with open boundaries, avoiding at the same time unphysical boundary effects thanks to a Jarzynski-inspired reweighting-like procedure. We present preliminary results obtained applying this setup to the $4d$ $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ pure-gauge theory and we outline a computational strategy to mitigate topological freezing in this theory.</description>

      <title>Two-photon contribution to the $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay amplitude from a $1/a\approx 1 $ GeV lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the long-distance two-photon contribution to the decay amplitude of a long-lived kaon to a pair of muons on a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass ensemble. In these proceedings, the theoretical foundation of this calculation will be reviewed and preliminary numerical results will be presented for all diagrams with the exception of those that are quark-line disconnected SU(3)-flavor-suppressed. At this stage, the intermediate $\eta$ contribution appears to be the largest source of statistical uncertainty. Our proposed strategies to reduce these statistical errors are discussed in great detail.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Three Nucleon Forces and their Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new class of three-nucleon forces that arises in the low-energy effective theory of nuclear interactions including pions. We estimate their contribution to the energy of neutron and nuclear matter and find that it can be as important as the leading-order three-nucleon forces previously considered in the literature. The magnitude of this force is set by the strength of the coupling of pions to two nucleons and is presently not well constrained by experiments. The implications for nuclei, nuclear matter, and the equation of state of neutron matter are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Potentials for $SU(3)$ Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop parameterizations of 8 of the lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials for quarkonium hybrid mesons as functions of the separation $r$ of the static quark and antiquark sources. The parameters are determined by fitting results calculated using pure $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory. The parameterizations have the correct limiting behavior at small $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with gluelumps. They have the correct limiting behavior at large $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with excitations of a relativistic string. There is a narrow avoided crossing in the small-$r$ region between two potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers.</description>
