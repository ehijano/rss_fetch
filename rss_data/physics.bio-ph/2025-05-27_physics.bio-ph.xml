      <title>Microtubule polymerization generates microtentacles important in circulating tumor cell invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have crucial roles in the spread of tumors during metastasis. A decisive step is the extravasation of CTCs from the blood stream or lymph system, which depends on the ability of cells to attach to vessel walls. Recent work suggests that such adhesion is facilitated by microtubule (MT)-based membrane protrusions called microtentacles (McTNs). However, how McTNs facilitate such adhesion and how MTs can generate protrusions in CTCs remain unclear. By combining fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments and simulations we show that polymerization of MTs provides the main driving force for McTN formation, whereas the contribution of MTs sliding with respect to each other is minimal. Further, the forces exerted on the McTN tip result in curvature, as the MTs are anchored at the other end in the MT organizing center. When approaching vessel walls, McTN curvature is additionally influenced by the adhesion strength between the McTN and wall. Moreover, increasing McTN length, reducing its bending rigidity, or strengthening adhesion enhances the cell-wall contact area and, thus, promotes cell attachment to vessel walls. Our results demonstrate a link between the formation and function of McTNs, which may provide new insight into metastatic cancer diagnosis and therapy.</description>

      <title>A Computational Approach for Modeling Platelet Adhesion Dynamics on Thrombogenic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platelet adhesion and aggregation are essential for primary hemostasis, forming a clot that quickly stops initial bleeding. Despite this critical role, the dynamic interactions of platelet receptors with exposed collagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF) at the injury site and how these interactions influence thrombus formation under varying blood flow conditions are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of platelet adhesion and aggregation on collagen- or vWF-coated surfaces numerically. We combined the stochastic Bell's law with a deterministic elastic force featuring a time-dependent coefficient within the context of a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) model to simulate thrombosis formation numerically. Our simulation results revealed that the numerically predicted platelet adhesion patterns closely matched experimental observations reported in the literature, demonstrating accurate replication of platelet behavior on collagen- and vWF-coated surfaces. Consequently, our deterministic/stochastic force model in DPD provides valuable insights into platelet adhesion dynamics under different flow conditions. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of platelet dynamics and potential therapeutic targets for managing hemostatic disorders.</description>

      <title>Muscle Crossbridge Theory With Internal Crossbridge Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe in this paper a crossbridge model in which an attached crossbridge behaves like a linear spring with a variable rest length. We assume in particular that the rest length has a linear force-velocity relation, and that the force and rest length are both zero at the moment of crossbridge attachment. Crossbridges that are not attached in our model have a fixed probability per unit time of attachment, and attached crossbridges have a probability per unit time of detachment that is a function of the crossbridge force. This detachment rate is uniquely determined by the requirement that a limiting form of the model should reproduce the force-velocity curve and heat of shortening discovered by A.V.Hill~\cite{AVHILL}, and the detachment rate turns out to be a linearly decreasing function of the crossbridge force. The parameters of the model are determined by a fit to steady-state experimental data; and then an event-driven stochastic simulation methodology is introduced in order to study the behavior of the model in a simulated quick-release experiment. The model explains how the crossbridge can act like a linear spring on a fast time scale but have very different properties on a slower time scale.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced with fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue to be a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing in some cases. We test our results numerically in a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and discuss the limits of the chaotic Kramers' law as well as its surprisingly wide parameter range of applicability. Hereby, we show in detail how to apply Hasselmann's program in practice and give a possible explanation for recent findings of AMOC collapse and recovery in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>Spin-Waves without Spin-Waves: A Case for Soliton Propagation in Starling Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective turns in starling flocks propagate linearly with negligible attenuation, indicating the existence of an underdamped sector in the dispersion relation. Beside granting linear propagation of the phase perturbations, the real part of the frequency should also yield a spin-wave form of the unperturbed correlation function. However, new high-resolution experiments on real flocks show that underdamped traveling waves coexist with an overdamped Lorentzian correlation. Theory and experiments are reconciled once we add to the dynamics a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou term.</description>

      <title>Technical recommendation on multiplex MR elastography for tomographic mapping of abdominal stiffness with a focus on the pancreas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: MR elastography (MRE) offers valuable mechanical tissue characterization, however, in deep abdominal organs like the pancreas conventional single-driver, single-frequency approaches often fail. This study evaluates whether multiplex MRE using multiple drivers and vibration frequencies can overcome these limitations.
  Methods: This study used single-shot spin-echo MRE in 18 healthy volunteers targeting the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen. Each healthy volunteer underwent 16 MRE examinations with different sets of four vibration frequencies (30-60 Hz) and four driver combinations, and an additional null experiment without vibrations. Further, a cohort of 14 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were retrospectively assessed. The quality of shear-wave fields and stiffness maps was assessed by displacement amplitudes and image sharpness.
  Results: In healthy volunteers, abdominal coverage with displacement amplitudes above the pre-determined noise level of 4 {\mu}m varied between MRE configurations: 24.2% ([0.0%-56.2%], single-driver, 60 Hz), 66.9% ([24.8%-97.7%], single-driver, 30-60 Hz), 70.2% ([0.0%-92.5%], multi-driver, 60 Hz) and 99.9% ([89.4%-100%], multi-driver, 30-60 Hz). In the pancreas, &gt;60% coverage was achieved in all subjects using four drivers and multiple frequencies. This was achieved in only 2/18 subjects using single-driver/single-frequency MRE. Patients with PDAC had 99.1% [91.4%-100%] coverage in the pancreas and 96.3% [63.1%-100%] abdominal coverage (multi-driver, 30-60 Hz).
  Conclusion: MRE with four drivers and multiple vibration frequencies between 30-60 Hz enables tomographic mapping of tissue stiffness across the entire abdomen, including the pancreas. Multiplex MRE offers a promising approach for generating detailed images of abdominal stiffness, potentially enhancing clinical diagnostics for abdominal and pancreatic diseases.</description>

      <title>Protein-DNA Co-condensation is Prewetting to a Collapsed Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-dimensional organization of chromatin is thought to play an important role in controlling gene expression. Specificity in expression is achieved through the interaction of transcription factors and other nuclear proteins with particular sequences of DNA. At unphysiological concentrations many of these nuclear proteins can phase-separate in the absence of DNA, and it has been hypothesized that, in vivo, the thermodynamic forces driving these phases help determine chromosomal organization. However it is unclear how DNA, itself a long polymer subject to configurational transitions, interacts with three-dimensional protein phases. Here we show that a long compressible polymer can be coupled to interacting protein mixtures, leading to a generalized prewetting transition where polymer collapse is coincident with a locally stabilized liquid droplet. We use lattice Monte-Carlo simulations and a mean-field theory to show that these phases can be stable even in regimes where both polymer collapse and coexisting liquid phases are unstable in isolation, and that these new transitions can be either abrupt or continuous. For polymers with internal linear structure we further show that changes in the concentration of bulk components can lead to changes in three-dimensional polymer structure. In the nucleus there are many distinct proteins that interact with many different regions of chromatin, potentially giving rise to many different Prewet phases. The simple systems we consider here highlight chromatin's role as a lower-dimensional surface whose interactions with proteins are required for these novel phases.</description>

      <title>Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ``hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</description>

      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-masses for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of data analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>

      <title>Excitability and travelling waves in renewable active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.</description>
