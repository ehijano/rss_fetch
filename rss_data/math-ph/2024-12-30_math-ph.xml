      <title>Transit-Length Distribution for Particle Transport in Binary Markovian Mixed Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence between the telegraph random process and transport within a binary stochastic Markovian mixture is established. This equivalence is used to derive the distribution function for the transit length, defined as the distance a particle moving along a straight-line trajectory travels through a specific material zone within the random mixture. A numerically robust asymptotic form of this distribution is obtained for highly mixed materials and the convergence to the atomic-mix limit is shown. The validity of the distribution is verified using a Monte Carlo simulation of the transport process. The distribution is applied to particle transport in slab geometry containing porous media for two cases: the transmission of light and the stopping of charged particles. For both of these applications, analytical forms using the approximate asymptotic model for the transmission probability of beam sources are obtained and illustrative numerical results are provided. These results show that in cases of highly mixed materials, the asymptotic forms are more accurate than the atomic-mix limit.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations . The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is the particle in central field with varying trajectories restricted by equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space gets one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for precession of trajectories. $K=0$ corresponds to the trajectories of usual Lagrangian dynamics. The second example is the linearized gravity with Einstein-Hilbert action and the class of varying fields is restricted by linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of the Wilson family of matrix models and moments of multivariable orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new examples of superintegrable matrix/eigenvalue models. These examples arise as a result of the exploration of the relationship between the theory of superintegrability and multivariate orthogonal polynomials. The new superintegrable examples are built upon the multivariate generalizations of the Meixner-Pollaczek and Wilson polynomials and their respective measures. From the perspective of multivariate orthogonal polynomials in this work we propose expressions for (generalized) moments of the respective multi-variable measures. From the perspective of superintegrability we uncover a couple of new phenomena such as the deviation from Schur polynomials as the superintegrable basis without any deformation and new combinatorial structures appearing in the answers.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystal problem -- on rigidity of non-periodic structures from statistical mechanics point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief history of quasicrystals and a short introduction to classical lattice-gas models of interacting particles. We discuss stability of non-periodic tilings and one-dimensional sequences of symbols seen as ground states of some hamiltonians. We argue that some sort of homogeneity, the so-called Strict Boundary Condition, is necessary for stability of non-periodic ground states against small perturbations of interactions and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Landau damping below survival threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish nonlinear Landau damping below survival threshold for collisionless charged particles following the meanfield Vlasov theory near general radial equilibria. In absence of collisions, the long-range Coulomb pair interaction between particles self-consistently gives rise to oscillations, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves, that disperse in space like a Klein-Gordon's dispersive wave. As a matter of fact, there is a non-trivial survival threshold of wave numbers that characterizes the large time dynamics of a plasma: {\em phase mixing} above the threshold driven by the free transport dynamics and {\em plasma oscillations} below the threshold driven by the collective meanfield interaction. The former mechanism provides exponential damping, while the latter is much slower and dictated by Klein-Gordon's dispersion which gives decay of the electric field precisely at rate of order $t^{-3/2}$. Up to date, all the works in the mathematical literature on nonlinear Landau damping fall into the phase mixing regime, in which plasma oscillations were absent. The present work resolves the problem in the plasma oscillation regime. Our nonlinear analysis includes (1) establishing the existence and dispersion of Langmuir's waves, (2) decoupling oscillations from phase mixing in different time regimes, (3) detailing the oscillatory structure of particle trajectories in the phase space, (4) treating plasma echoes via a detailed analysis of particle-particle, particle-wave, and wave-wave interaction, and (5) designing a nonlinear iterative scheme in the physical space that captures both phase mixing and dispersion in low norms and allows growth in time in high norms. As a result, we establish nonlinear plasma oscillations and Landau damping below survival threshold for data with finite Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several generalizations of Vershik-Kerov limit shape problem are motivated by topological string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. In this paper specifically we study the circular and linear quiver theories. We also briefly discuss the double-elliptic generalization of the Vershik-Kerov problem, related to six dimensional gauge theory compactified on a torus, and to elliptic cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of points on a plane. We prove that the limit shape in that setting is governed by a genus two algebraic curve, suggesting unexpected dualities between the enumerative and equivariant parameters.</description>

      <title>The discrete Painlev\'{e} XXXIV hierarchy arising from the gap probability distributions of Freud unitary ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the symmetric gap probability distributions of certain Freud unitary ensembles. This problem is related to the Hankel determinants generated by the Freud weights supported on the complement of a symmetric interval. By using Chen and Ismail's ladder operator approach, we obtain the difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients for the orthogonal polynomials with the discontinuous Freud weights. We find that these equations, with a minor change of variables, are the discrete Painlev\'{e} XXXIV hierarchy proposed by Cresswell and Joshi [{\em J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.} {\bf 32} ({1999}) {655--669}]. We also derive the differential-difference equations for the recurrence coefficients and show the relationship between the logarithmic derivative of the gap probabilities, the nontrivial leading coefficients of the monic orthogonal polynomials and the recurrence coefficients.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of Generalized Polarization Tensors vanishing structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the open problem proposed in Ammari et. al. Commun. Math.Phys, 2013. We first investigate the existence and uniqueness of Generalized Polarization Tensors (GPTs) vanishing structures locally in both two and three dimension by fixed point theorem. Employing the Brouwer Degree Theory and the local uniqueness, we prove that for any radius configuration of $N+1$ layers concentric disks (balls) and a fixed core conductivity, there exists at least one piecewise homogeneous conductivity distribution which achieves the $N$-GPTs vanishing. Furthermore, we establish a global uniqueness result for the case of proportional radius settings, and derive an interesting asymptotic configuration for structure with thin coatings. Finally, we present some numerical examples to validate our theoretical conclusions.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Volume, Polyakov Anomaly and Orbifold Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2310.17536, two of the authors studied the function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}} = S_{\boldsymbol{m}} - \pi \sum_{i=1}^n (m_i - \tfrac{1}{m_i}) \log \mathsf{h}_{i}$ for orbifold Riemann surfaces of signature $(g;m_1,...,m_{n_e};n_p)$ on the generalized Schottky space $\mathfrak{S}_{g,n}(\boldsymbol{m})$. In this paper, we prove the holographic duality between $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and the renormalized hyperbolic volume $V_{\text{ren}}$ of the corresponding Schottky 3-orbifolds with lines of conical singularity that reach the conformal boundary. In case of the classical Liouville action on $\mathfrak{S}_{g}$ and $\mathfrak{S}_{g,n}(\boldsymbol{\infty})$, the holography principle was proved in arXiv:0005106 and arXiv:1508.02102, respectively. Our result implies that $V_{\text{ren}}$ acts as K\"ahler potential for a particular combination of the Weil-Petersson and Takhtajan-Zograf metrics that appears in the local index theorem for orbifold Riemann surfaces arXiv:1701.00771. Moreover, we demonstrate that under the conformal transformations, the change of function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ is equivalent to the Polyakov anomaly, which indicates that the function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ is a consistent height function with a unique hyperbolic solution. Consequently, the associated renormalized hyperbolic volume $V_{\text{ren}}$ also admits a Polyakov anomaly formula. The method we used to establish this equivalence may provide an alternative approach to derive the renormalized Polyakov anomaly for Riemann surfaces with punctures (cusps), as described in arXiv:0909.0807.</description>

Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in low-dimensional long-range random field Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-range random field Ising model in dimension $d = 1, 2$, whereas the long-range interaction is of the form $J_{xy} = |x-y|^{-\alpha}$ with $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 3/2$ for $d=1$ and with $2 &lt; \alpha \leq 3$ for $d = 2$. Our main results establish phase transitions in these regimes. In one dimension, we employ a Peierls argument with some novel modification, suitable for dealing with the randomness coming from the external field; in two dimensions, our proof follows that of Affonso, Bissacot, and Maia (2023) with some adaptations, but new ideas are required in the critical case of $\alpha=3$.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger operators with non-integer power-law potentials and Lie-Rinehart algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators $H:= -\Delta + V$ with potentials $V$ that have power-law growth (not necessarily polynomial) at 0 and at $\infty$ using methods of Lie theory (Lie-Rinehart algebras) and microlocal analysis. More precisely, we show that $H$ is ''generated'' in a certain sense by an explicit Lie-Rinehart algebra. This allows then to construct a suitable (microlocal) calculus of pseudodifferential operators that provides further properties of $H$. Classically, this microlocal analysis method was used to study $H$ when the power-laws describing the potential $V$ have integer exponents. Thus, the main point of this paper is that this integrality condition on the exponents is not really necessary for the microlocal analysis method to work. While we consider potentials following (possibly non-integer) power-laws both at the origin and at infinity, our results extend right away to potentials having power-law singularities at several points. The extension of the classical microlocal analysis results to potentials with non-integer power-laws is achieved by considering the setting of Lie-Rinehart algebras and of the continuous family groupoids integrating them. (The classical case relies instead on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.)</description>

      <title>Yangian symmetry, GKZ equations and integrable Feynman graphs in conformal variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the differential equations that follow from Yangian symmetry which was recently observed for a large class of conformal Feynman graphs, originating from integrable `fishnet' theories. We derive, for the first time, the explicit general form of these equations in the most useful conformal cross-ratio variables, valid for any spacetime dimension. This allows us to explore their properties in detail. In particular, we observe that for general Feynman graphs a large set of terms in the Yangian equations can be identified with famous GKZ (Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky) hypergeometric operators. We also show that for certain nontrivial graphs the relation with GKZ systems is exact, opening the way to using new powerful solution methods. As a side result, we also elucidate the constraints on the topology and parameter space of Feynman graphs stemming from Yangian invariance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of a chiral scalar on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the entanglement entropy of an interval for a chiral scalar on a circle at an arbitrary temperature. We use the resolvent method, which involves expressing the entropy in terms of the resolvent of a certain operator, and we compute that resolvent by solving a problem that entails finding an analytic function on the complex torus with certain jump conditions at the interval. The resolvent is relevant by itself, since it can be used to compute any function of the reduced density matrix. We illustrate that by also computing all the R\'enyi entropies for the model.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet energy and focusing NLS condensates of minimal intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the family of (poly)continua $\mathcal K$ in the upper half-plane ${\mathbb H} $ that contain a preassigned finite {\it anchor} set $E$. For a given harmonic external field we define a Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ and show that within each ``connectivity class'' of the family, there exists a minimizing compact $\mathcal K^*$ consisting of critical trajectories of a quadratic differential. In many cases this quadratic differential coincides with the square of the real normalized quasimomentum differential ${\rm d} {\mathbf p}$ associated with the finite gap solutions of the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (fNLS) defined by a hyperelliptic Riemann surface $\mathfrak R$ branched at the points $E\cup\bar E$.
  An fNLS soliton condensate is defined by a compact $\mathcal K\subset{\mathbb H} $ (its spectral support) whereas the average intensity of the condensate is proportional to $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ with external field given by $\Im z$. The motivation for this work lies in the problem of soliton condensate of least average intensity such that $E$ belongs to the poly-continuum $\mathcal K$. We prove that spectral support $\mathcal K^*$ provides the fNLS soliton condensate of the least average intensity within a given ``connectivity class''.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q)$ be the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation in the equivariant quantum K-theory for Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) \Psi\left(\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $\zeta_p$ in the curve counting parameter $q$. As a byproduct, we show that the eigenvalues of the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}$ from the quantum difference equation on $X$ $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) $$ evaluated at $\zeta_p$ are described by the Bethe equations for $X$ in which all variables are substituted by their $p$-th powers.
  Finally, upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation on $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field with finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding differential connection whereas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we are reproducing, in part, the statement of a theorem by Etingof and Varchenko.</description>

      <title>On the Symmetry of Odd Leech Lattice CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Mathieu groups $M_{24}$ and $M_{23}$ in the isometry group of the odd Leech lattice do not lift to subgroups of the automorphism group of its lattice vertex operator (super)algebra. In other words, the subgroups $2^{24}.M_{24}$ and $2^{23}.M_{23}$ of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice vertex operator algebra are non-split extensions. Our method can also confirm a similar result for the Conway group $\mathrm{Co}_0$ and the Leech lattice, which was already shown in [Griess 1973]. This study is motivated by the moonshine-type observation on the $\mathcal{N}=2$ extremal elliptic genus of central charge 24 by [Benjamin, Dyer, Fitzpatrick, Kachru arXiv:1507.00004]. We also investigate weight-1 and weight-$\frac{3}{2}$ currents invariant under the subgroup $2^{24}.M_{24}$ or $2^{23}.M_{23}$ of the automorphism group of the odd Leech lattice vertex operator algebra, and revisit an $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra in it.</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

Abstract: The triad refers to embedding the Macdonald polynomials into the Noumi-Shiraishi functions and their reduction to solutions of simple linear equations at particular values of $t$. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory. We discuss lifting the triad to an elliptic generalization of the Noumi-Shiraishi functions. The central unknown ingredient is linear equations, for which we discuss various possible approaches, including immediate elliptic deformation of periodicity conditions, (elliptic) Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra operators, and elliptic Kostka coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modifications of standard general relativity that bring torsion into a game have a long-standing history. However, no convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the torsion shall be excluded from the consideration. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <title>A non-semisimple non-invertible symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the action of a non-semisimple, non-invertible symmetry on spin chains, whose topological defects encode the category of modules over the Taft algebra of dimension 4. Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several symmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse their ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena. First, we identify an $\mathbb{S}^1$-parametrised family of symmetric states, all of which belong to the same gapped phase with respect to the invertible subsymmetry, yet transform inequivalently under the non-semisimple symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry. We further relate the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit to the notion that they are associated with a simple object and its projective cover, respectively, in a non-semisimple module category.</description>

      <title>Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and the K-identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <title>Branes and Representations of DAHA $C^\vee C_1$: affine braid group action on category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of $C^\vee C_1$, using brane quantization. By showing a one-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support and finite-dimensional representations of the spherical DAHA, we provide evidence of derived equivalence between the $A$-brane category of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of a four-punctured sphere and the representation category of DAHA of $C^\vee C_1$. The $D_4$ root system plays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation theory. In particular, this $A$-model approach reveals the action of an affine braid group of type $D_4$ on the category. As a by-product, our geometric investigation offers detailed information about the low-energy dynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. In this paper, we review the construction of the Geroch--Hansen multipole moments for stationary asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. Based on Geroch's approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments behave under such transformations.</description>

      <title>Casimir Radial Parts via Matsuki Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Matsuki's decomposition for symmetric pairs $(G, H)$ of (not necessarily compact) reductive Lie groups to construct the radial parts for invariant differential operators acting on matrix-spherical functions. As an application, we employ this machinery to formulate an alternative, mathematically rigorous approach to obtaining radial parts of Casimir operators that appear in the theory of conformal blocks, which avoids poorly defined analytical continuations from the compact quotient cases. To exemplify how this works, after reviewing the presentation of conformal 4-point correlation functions via matrix-spherical functions for the corresponding symmetric pair, we for the first time provide a complete analysis of the Casimir radial part decomposition in the case of Lorentzian signature. As another example, we revisit the Casimir reduction in the case of conformal blocks for two scalar defects of equal dimension. We argue that Matsuki's decomposition thus provides a proper mathematical framework for analysing the correspondence between Casimir equations and the Calogero-Sutherland-type models, first discovered by one of the authors and Schomerus.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space with Wigner negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different variants of partial orders among quantum states arise naturally in the context of various quantum resources. For example, in discrete variable quantum computation, stabilizer operations naturally produce an order between input and output states; in technical terms this order is vector majorization of discrete Wigner functions in discrete phase space. The order results in inequalities for magic monotones. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In particular, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. Among our results, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf for the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, and a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <title>All Finite (Anti)Hermitian Irreducible Representations of the de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter Lie Algebras and Their Lorentz Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the importance of unitarity in quantum physics, work on the representations of the de Sitter group has focussed on the unitary case, which necessarily means infinite dimensional matrices for this non-compact group. Here we address the finite dimensional representations resulting from the requirement that the Lie algebra generators are either Hermitian or anti-Hermitian. The complete classification of all such irreducible representations is found and their matrix elements specified. These irreducible representations (irreps) are based on backbones defined as the homogeneous Lorentz sub-algebra and consisting of direct sums of the finite irreps of the homogeneous Lorentz algebra (HLA). Only two types of such backbones arise (see 5.1a,b herein). Consequently, only certain dimensions of representation are possible, namely 4, 5, 10, 14, 20, 30, 35, 55, 56, 91, etc or generally either 1/6 N(N+1)(N+2) or 1/6 N(N+1)(2N+1) where N=2,3,4,etc is the number of HLA irreps in the backbone (minimum 2). The two Casimir invariants can be specified in terms of a single integral or half-integral parameter, p. For irreps based on (5.1a), -C1=p(p+1)-2 and C2=0 with p taking values 2,3,4,etc. For irreps based on (5.1b), -C1=2(p^2-1) and -C2= p^2 (p^2-1) with p taking values 3/2,2,5/2,3,etc. These correspond to the same expressions found for the unitary representations, -C1=p(p+1)+(q+1)(q-2) and -C2=p(p+1)q(q-1) with q=0 and q=p respectively for the two types of irrep. There is thus a far more restricted set of finite irreps with Hermitian or anti-Hermitian generators than for the discrete infinite dimensional unitary irreps. The corresponding irreps of the anti-de Sitter group follow immediately from the replacement of the 4-momentum operators from V to iV.</description>

      <title>The non-standad logic of physics: the case of the Boltzmann-Sinai hard-sphere system</title>

Abstract: One of the most challenging and fascinating issues in mathematical and theoretical physics concerns identifying the common logic, if any, which underlies the physical world. More precisely, this involves the search of the possibly-unique axiomatic logical proposition calculus to apply simultaneously both to classical and quantum realms of physics and to be consistent with the corresponding mathematical and filosophysical setups. Based on the recent establishment of quantum logic, which has been shown to apply both to Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Gravity, the crucial remaining step involves the identification of the appropriate axiomatic logical proposition calculus to be associated with Classical Mechanics. In this paper the issue is posed for a fundamental example of Classical Mechanics, which is represented by the so-called Boltzmann-Sinai dynamical system. This is realized by the ensemble of classical smooth hard-spheres, which is set at the basis of Classical Statistical Mechanics and is also commonly regarded as a possible realization of Classical Newtonian Cosmology. Depending on the initial conditions which are prescribed for such a system, its classical state is shown to obey the propositional calculus of non-classical logic. In particular, the latter is expressed by the 3-way Principle of Non-Contradiction, namely the same logical principle that holds for quantum logic. The result therefore permits to question on a mathematical basis the principles of deterministic classical logic and the validity of their character within the domain of Classical Physics. Such a conclusion represents a potential notable innovation in the logical dicotomy true/false, a crucial topic which has crossed millennia through philosophy, logic, mathematics and physics.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>On dual-projectively equivalent connections associated to second order superintegrable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In projective differential geometry, pre-geodesics of an affine connection are curves that are geodesics after a reparametrization (the analogous concept in K\"ahler geometry is known as $J$-planar curves). Similarly, dual-geodesics on a Riemannian manifold are curves along which the $1$-forms associated to the velocity are preserved after a reparametrization. Superintegrable systems are Hamiltonian systems with a large number of independent constants of the motion. They are said to be second order if the constants of the motion can be chosen to be quadratic polynomials in the momenta. Famous examples include the Kepler-Coulomb and the harmonic oscillator systems, which are foundational models in the Sciences. We show that certain torsion-free affine connections which are naturally associated to certain second order superintegrable systems share the same dual-geodesics.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Conformal Loop Ensemble: Imaginary DOZZ Formula and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.01788v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaling limit of the probability that $n$ points are on the same cluster for 2D critical percolation is believed to be governed by a conformal field theory (CFT). Although this is not fully understood, Delfino and Viti (2010) made a remarkable prediction on the exact value of a properly normalized three-point probability. It is expressed in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula of Schomerus, Zamolodchikov and Kostov-Petkova, which extends the structure constants of minimal model CFTs to continuous parameters. Later, similar conjectures were made for scaling limits of random cluster models and O$(n)$ loop models, representing certain three-point observables in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula. Since the scaling limits of these models can be described by the conformal loop ensemble (CLE), such conjectures can be formulated as exact statements on CLE observables. In this paper, we prove Delfino and Viti's conjecture on percolation as well as a conjecture of Ikhlef, Jacobsen and Saleur (2015) on the nesting loop statistics of CLE. Our proof is based on the coupling between CLE and Liouville quantum gravity on the sphere, and is inspired by the fact that after reparametrization, the imaginary DOZZ formula is the reciprocal of the three-point function of Liouville CFT. Recently, Nivesvivat, Jacobsen and Ribault systematically studied a CFT with a large class of CLE observables as its correlation functions, including the ones from these two conjectures. We believe that our framework admits sufficient flexibility to exactly solve the three-point functions for CLE observables with natural geometric interpretations, including those from this CFT. As a demonstration, we solve the case corresponding to three points lying on the same loop, where the answer is a variant of the imaginary DOZZ formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new formulas for the expectation and variance of Wilson loops for any contractible simple loop on a compact orientable surface of genus $1$ and higher, in the model of two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$. They are written in terms of a Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ introduced recently by the author and M. Ma\"ida \cite{LM3}. From these formulas, we prove a quantitative result on the convergence of the expectation and variance as $N$ tends to infinity, refining a result of the author and A. Dahlqvist \cite{DL}. We finally derive the large $g$ limit of the Wilson loop expectation and variance, by analogy with the study of integrals on moduli spaces of compact hyperbolic surfaces. Surprisingly, the variance does not vanish in this regime, but there are no nontrivial fluctuations of any order.</description>

Abstract: The differential equations of the Wilson renormalization group are a powerful tool to study the Schwinger functions of Euclidean quantum field theory. In particular renormalization theory can be based entirely on inductively bounding their perturbatively expanded solutions. Recently the solutions of these equations for scalar field theory have been analysed rigorously without recourse to perturbation theory, at the cost of restricting to the mean-field approximation. In particular it was shown there that one-component $\varphi^4_4$-theory is trivial if the bare coupling constant of the UV regularized theory is not large. This paper presents progress w.r.t. Kopper's previous paper on asymptotically free solutions of the mean-field scalar flow equations: 1. The upper bound on the bare coupling is sent to infinity and the proof is extended to $O(N)$ vector models. 2. The unphysical infrared cutoff used for technical simplicity is replaced by a physical mass.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the contact structures and dynamics of stochastic vector bundles, leading to the formulation of the least constraint theorem. It is found that the probability space of stochastic vector bundles possesses an infinite-order jet structure, which enables the geometric analysis of stochastic processes. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that stochastic vector bundles have a natural contact structure, leading to the decomposition of the tangent space and providing insight into the evolution and constraints of the system. Finally, we derive a set of contact dynamical equations for the stochastic vector bundles. These equations correspond to the least constraint on the evolution of stochastic vector bundles, which is a counterpart to the least action principle for symplectic structures. This shows the relationship between the geometric structure of the stochastic system evolution and its tendency to minimize constraints. This study provides a geometric framework for analyzing stochastic space with potential applications in various fields where probabilistic behavior is crucial.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the variance of both smooth linear statistics and rough linear statistics (counting statistics) of random normal matrices. The two classical ensembles of random matrices, the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) and the complex Ginibre ensemble, enjoy an exact map to the ground state of noninteracting Fermions in a harmonic trap in one, respectively two dimensions. Both feature that the variance of the number of Fermions (the number variance) in a set $A$, and the respective entanglement entropy are proportional. For the Ginibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial symmetric sets $A$, and we prove it in generality for subsets $A$ of the bulk, thus establishing a holographic principle. Moreover, for generic random normal matrix ensembles depending on some potential $V$, not necessarily exhibiting radial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is proportional to the circumference of $A$, $\sim\sqrt{n}|\partial A|$. A special focus is on the variance of linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, which interpolates between the GUE and Ginibre ensemble, in various regimes of non-Hermiticity, where we enlarge the concept of weak non-Hermiticity to mesoscopic scales. Within the elliptic Ginibre ensemble we prove that for smooth test functions $f$ its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble. The interpolation depends on two positive parameters, the rescaling $\alpha$ of the weak non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau=1-\kappa n^{-\alpha}$, and the rescaling $\gamma$ of the test function $f(n^\gamma z)$, for a continuous range of values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. In the mesoscopic regime and when $\alpha=\gamma&lt;1$, we prove an interpolating central limit theorem with an adaptation of the method of Ward identities.</description>

Abstract: We consider soliton gas solutions of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, where the point spectrum of the condensate is located within a bounded domain in the upper half-plane. We first demonstrate that when the domain is a quadrature and the soliton density is an analytic function, the corresponding deterministic soliton gas coincides with a finite number of solitons, which we call this effect soliton shielding. When the domain is an ellipse and the soliton density is analytic, the corresponding deterministic soliton gas reduces the spectral data to the segment joining the foci. The initial datum of this Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory, described by a periodic elliptic function as \( x \to +\infty \), and it vanishes exponentially fast as \( x \to -\infty \).</description>

      <title>The *-Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-reversible generalization of the Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process (VRJP), called the *-Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process (*-VRJP) and introduced by Bacallado, Sabot and Tarr\`es (2020). It can be seen as the continuous-time counterpart to the *-Edge-Reinforced Random Walk (*-ERRW), see Bacallado (2011) and Bacallado, Sabot and Tarr\`es (2020), which is itself a non-reversible, and in fact Yaglom reversible, generalization of the original ERRW introduced by Coppersmith and Diaconis (1986). In contrast to the classical VRJP, the *-VRJP is not exchangeable after time-change, which leads to several difficulties and new phenomena.
  Firstly, we show that with some appropriate randomization of the initial local time, it becomes partially exchangeable after time-change. We provide a representation of the "randomized" *-VRJP as a mixture of Yaglom reversible Markov jump processes with an explicit mixing measure, and we prove that the non-randomized *-VRJP can be written as a mixture of conditioned Markov processes.
  Secondly, we give a representation of the *-VRJP in terms of a random Schr\"odinger operator. The corresponding representation for the classical VRJP has proved to be very useful in the understanding of its asymptotic behavior. The construction is based on several new and rather remarkable identities between integrals on the space of *-symmetric and *-antisymmetric functions on vertices. We give a description of the randomized *-VRJP in terms of that random Schr\"odinger operator, which allows us to prove the representation of the randomized *-VRJP as a mixture of Markov jump processes in a different and more analytic manner. Similarly as for the VRJP, we think that the representation by a random Schr\"odinger operator and the associated identities are key-features of the *-VRJP.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable non-oscillatory fluxes: An optimized wedding of entropy conservative flux with non-oscillatory flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.07088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work frames the problem of constructing non-oscillatory entropy stable fluxes as a least square optimization problem. A flux sign stability condition is defined for a pair of entropy conservative flux ($F^*$) and a non-oscillatory flux ($F^s$). This novel approach paves a way to construct non-oscillatory entropy stable flux ($\hat{F}$) as a simple combination of $(F^*$ and $F^s)$ which inherently optimize the numerical diffusion in the entropy stable flux ($\hat{F}$) such that it reduces to the underlying non-oscillatory flux ($F^s$) in the flux sign stable region. This robust approach is (i) agnostic to the choice of flux pair $(F^*,F^s)$, (ii) does not require the computation of costly dissipation operator and high order reconstruction of scaled entropy variable to construct the diffusion term. Various non-oscillatory entropy stable fluxes are constructed and exhaustive computational results for standard test problems are given which show that these entropy stable schemes completely remove spurious oscillations in approximating the discontinuities compared to the non-oscillatory schemes using underlying fluxes ($F^s$) only. Moreover, these entropy stable schemes maintain the formal order of accuracy of the lower order flux in the pair.</description>

      <title>Deautonomisation by singularity confinement and degree growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an explanation of a number of observations relating to degree growth of birational mappings of the plane and their deautonomisation by singularity confinement. These observations are of a link between two a priori unrelated notions: firstly the dynamical degree of the mapping and secondly the evolution of parameters required for its singularity structure to remain unchanged under a sufficiently general deautonomisation. We explain this correspondence for a large class of birational mappings of the plane via the spaces of initial conditions for their deautonomised versions. We show that even for non-integrable mappings in this class, the surfaces forming these spaces have effective anticanonical divisors and one can define a period map parametrising them, similar to that in the theory of rational surfaces associated with discrete Painlev\'e equations. This provides a bridge between the evolution of coefficients in the deautonomised mapping and the induced dynamics on the Picard lattice which encode the dynamical degree.</description>

      <title>Discrete dynamics in the set of quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum measurement, often referred to as positive operator-valued measurement (POVM), is a set of positive operators $P_j=P_j^\dag\geq 0$ summing to identity, $\sum_jP_j=\mathbb{1}$. This can be seen as a generalization of a probability distribution of positive real numbers summing to unity, whose evolution is given by a stochastic matrix. We describe discrete transformations in the set of quantum measurements by {\em blockwise stochastic matrices}, composed of positive blocks that sum columnwise to identity, using the notion of {\em sequential product} of matrices. We show that such transformations correspond to a sequence of quantum measurements. Imposing additionally the dual condition that the sum of blocks in each row is equal to identity, we arrive at blockwise bistochastic matrices (also called {\em quantum magic squares}). Analyzing their dynamical properties, we formulate our main result: a quantum analog of the Ostrowski description of the classical Birkhoff polytope, which introduces the notion of majorization between quantum measurements. Our framework provides a dynamical characterization of the set of blockwise bistochastic matrices and establishes a resource theory in this set.</description>

      <title>Path integral derivation of the thermofield double state in causal diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we adopt the framework developed by R. Laflamme in \textit{Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pp. 58-63 (1989) to analyze the path integral of a massless -- conformally invariant -- scalar field defined on a causal diamond of size $2\alpha$ in 1+1 dimensions. By examining the Euclidean geometry of the causal diamond, we establish that its structure is conformally related to the cylinder $S^{1}_{\beta} \otimes \mathbb{R}$, where the Euclidean time coordinate $\tau$ has a periodicity of $\beta$. This property, along with the conformal symmetry of the fields, allows us to identify the connection between the thermofield double (TFD) state of causal diamonds and the Euclidean path integral defined on the two disconnected manifolds of the cylinder. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the temperature of the TFD state, derived from the conditions in the Euclidean geometry and analytically calculated, coincides with the temperature of the causal diamond known in the literature. This derivation highlights the universality of the connection between the Euclidean path integral formalism and the TFD state of the causal diamond, as well as it further establishes causal diamonds as a model that exhibits all desired properties of a system exhibiting the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <title>SLE Loop Measure and Liouville Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As recently shown by Holden and two of the authors, the conformal welding of two Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disks produces a canonical variant of SLE curve whose law is called the SLE loop measure. In this paper, we demonstrate how LQG can be used to study the SLE loop measure. Firstly, we show that for $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$, the loop intensity measure of the conformal loop ensemble agrees with the SLE loop measure as defined by Zhan (2021). The former was initially considered by Kemppainen and Werner (2016) for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$, and the latter was constructed for $\kappa\in (0,8)$. Secondly, we establish a duality for the SLE loop measure between $\kappa$ and $16/\kappa$. Thirdly, we obtain the exact formula for the moment of the electrical thickness for the shape (probability) measure of the SLE loop, which in the regime $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$ was conjectured by Kenyon and Wilson (2004). This relies on the exact formulae for the reflection coefficient and the one-point disk correlation function in Liouville conformal field theory. Finally, we compute several multiplicative constants associated with the SLE loop measure, which are not only of intrinsic interest but also used in our companion paper relating the conformal loop ensemble to the imaginary DOZZ formulae.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum pseudorandomness under conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work, we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in [PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Segal-Bargmann type spaces related to non-rotational measure, and entanglement of bipartite squeezed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite functions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach based on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic Hermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter associated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the squeezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is elucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable systems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined using the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle quantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>
