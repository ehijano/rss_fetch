      <title>Temporal Connectivity Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectivity in temporal graphs relies on the notion of temporal paths, in which edges follow a chronological order (either strict or non-strict). In this work, we investigate the question of how to make a temporal graph connected. More precisely, we tackle the problem of finding, among a set of proposed temporal edges, the smallest subset such that its addition makes the graph temporally connected (TCA). We study the complexity of this problem and variants, under restricted lifespan of the graph, i.e. the maximum time step in the graph. Our main result on TCA is that for any fixed lifespan at least 2, it is NP-complete in both the strict and non-strict setting. We additionally provide a set of restrictions in the non-strict setting which makes the problem solvable in polynomial time and design an algorithm achieving this complexity. Interestingly, we prove that the source variant (making a given vertex a source in the augmented graph) is as difficult as TCA. On the opposite, we prove that the version where a list of connectivity demands has to be satisfied is solvable in polynomial time, when the size of the list is fixed. Finally, we highlight a variant of the previous case for which even with two pairs the problem is already NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets and variants in chordal bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal dominating sets with polynomial delay in bipartite graphs is a long-standing open problem. To date, even the subcase of chordal bipartite graphs is open, with the best known algorithm due to Golovach, Heggernes, Kant\'e, Kratsch, Saether, and Villanger running in incremental-polynomial time. We improve on this result by providing a polynomial delay and space algorithm enumerating minimal dominating sets in chordal bipartite graphs. Additionally, we show that the total and connected variants admit polynomial and incremental-polynomial delay algorithms, respectively, within the same class. This provides an alternative proof of a result by Golovach et al. for total dominating sets, and answers an open question for the connected variant. Finally, we give evidence that the techniques used in this paper cannot be generalized to bipartite graphs for (total) minimal dominating sets, unless P = NP, and show that enumerating minimal connected dominating sets in bipartite graphs is harder than enumerating minimal transversals in general hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Every Graph is Essential to Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for every graph $H$, there is a hereditary weakly sparse graph class $\mathcal C_H$ of unbounded treewidth such that the $H$-free (i.e., excluding $H$ as an induced subgraph) graphs of $\mathcal C_H$ have bounded treewidth. This refutes several conjectures and critically thwarts the quest for the unavoidable induced subgraphs in classes of unbounded treewidth, a wished-for counterpart of the Grid Minor theorem. We actually show a stronger result: For every positive integer $t$, there is a hereditary graph class $\mathcal C_t$ of unbounded treewidth such that for any graph $H$ of treewidth at most $t$, the $H$-free graphs of $\mathcal C_t$ have bounded treewidth. Our construction is a variant of so-called layered wheels. We also introduce a framework of abstract layered wheels, based on their most salient properties. In particular, we streamline and extend key lemmas previously shown on individual layered wheels. We believe that this should greatly help develop this topic, which appears to be a very strong yet underexploited source of counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Characterizing traces of processes defined by precedence and response constraints: an order theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a general system of activities that can, but do not have to, occur. This system is governed by a set containing two types of constraints: precedence and response. A precedence constraint dictates that an activity can only occur if it has been preceded by some other specified activity. Response constraints are similarly defined. An execution of the system is a listing of activities in the order they occur and which satisfies all constraints. These listings are known as traces. Such systems naturally arise in areas of theoretical computer science and decision science. An outcome of the freedom with which activities can occur is that there are many different possible executions, and gaining a combinatorial insight into these is a non-trivial problem.
  We characterize all of the ways in which such a system can be executed. Our approach uses order theory to provide a classification in terms of the linear extensions of posets constructed from the constraint sets. This characterization is essential in calculating the stakeholder utility metrics that have been developed by the first author that allow for quantitative comparisons of such systems/processes. It also allows for a better understanding of the theoretical backbone to these processes.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We extend our results to all classical types. Type $D$ is resolved in the appendix (joint with David Speyer).</description>

      <title>Non-crossing $H$-graphs: a generalization of proper interval graphs admitting FPT algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new parameterized complexity results for the FO Model Checking problem and in particular for Independent Set, for two recently introduced subclasses of $H$-graphs, namely proper $H$-graphs and non-crossing $H$-graphs. It is known that proper $H$-graphs, and thus $H$-graphs, may have unbounded twin-width. However, we prove that for every connected multigraph $H$ with no self-loops, non-crossing $H$-graphs have bounded proper mixed-thinness, and thus bounded twin-width. Consequently, we can apply a well-known result of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e, and Watrigant (2021) to find that the FO Model Checking problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ for non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+\ell$, where $\Vert H \Vert$ is the size of $H$ and $\ell$ is the size of a formula. In particular, this implies that Independent Set is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ on non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$, where $k$ is the solution size. In contrast, Independent Set for general $H$-graphs is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert +k$. We strengthen the latter result by proving thatIndependent Set is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard even on proper $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$. In this way, we solve, subject to $\mathsf{W[1]}\neq \mathsf{FPT}$, an open problem of Chaplick (2023), who asked whether there exist problems that can be solved faster for non-crossing $H$-graphs than for proper $H$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Flow Decomposition Methods for RNA Multi-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decomposing a flow on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into a weighted sum of a small number of paths is an essential task in operations research and bioinformatics. This problem, referred to as Sparse Flow Decomposition (SFD), has gained significant interest, in particular for its application in RNA transcript multi-assembly, the identification of the multiple transcripts corresponding to a given gene and their relative abundance. Several recent approaches cast SFD variants as integer optimization problems, motivated by the NP-hardness of the formulations they consider. We propose an alternative formulation of SFD as a fitting problem on the conic hull of the flow polytope. By reformulating the problem on the flow polytope for compactness and solving it using specific variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we obtain a method converging rapidly to the minimizer of the chosen loss function while producing a parsimonious decomposition. Our approach subsumes previous formulations of SFD with exact and inexact flows and can model different priors on the error distributions. Computational experiments show that our method outperforms recent integer optimization approaches in runtime, but is also highly competitive in terms of reconstruction of the underlying transcripts, despite not explicitly minimizing the solution cardinality.</description>
