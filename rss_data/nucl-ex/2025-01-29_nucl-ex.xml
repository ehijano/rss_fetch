      <title>Hybrid Hadronization -- A Study of In-Medium Hadronization of Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD jets are considered important probes for quark gluon plasma created in collisions of nuclei at high energies. Their parton showers are significantly altered if they develop inside of a deconfined medium. Hadronization of jets is also thought to be affected by the presence of quarks and gluons. We present a systematic study of the effects of a thermal bath of partons on the hadronization of parton showers. We use the JETSCAPE framework to create parton showers both in vacuum and in a brick of quark gluon plasma. The brick setup allows important parameters, like the size of the plasma as well as the collective flow of partons, to be varied systematically. We hadronize the parton showers using Hybrid Hadronization, which permits shower partons to form strings with thermal partons, or to recombine directly with thermal partons as well as with each other. We find a sizeable amount of interaction of shower partons with thermal partons during hadronization, indicating a natural continuation of the interaction of jet and medium during this stage. The observed effects grow with the size of the medium. Collective flow easily transfers from the thermal partons onto the emerging jet hadrons. We also see a significant change in hadron chemistry as expected in the presence of quark recombination processes.</description>

      <title>Polarized Dissociation and Spin Alignment of Moving Quarkonium in Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have found spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in heavy ion collisions, suggesting a medium effect that is spin dependent. We propose a possible mechanism with polarized dissociation from the motion of $J/\psi$ with respect to the medium. We calculate polarized dissociation rate for quarkonium spin triplet state from spin chromomagnetic coupling in the potential non-relativistic QCD framework. This is done for the leading order gluo-dissociation process and next to leading order inelastic Coulomb scattering process. The polarized dissociation rate is expressed as a function of relative velocity between quarkonium and QGP and the quantization axis. Applying the polarized dissociation rate to quarkonium evolution with dissociation effect only in a Bjorken flow, we find the spin $0$ state to dissociate less than the other spin states, leading to positive $\rho_{00}-1/3$. Regeneration contribution is expected to give a contribution with the opposite sign.</description>

      <title>A General Track Fit based on Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general three-dimensional track fit based on hit triplets.
  The general track fit considers spatial hit and multiple Coulomb scattering uncertainties, and can also be extended to include energy losses.
  Input to the fit are detector-specific triplet parameters, which contain information about
  the triplet geometry (hit positions),
  the radiation length of the material and the magnetic field.
  Since the solution is given by an analytical closed-form, it is possible to use the same fitting code for all kind of tracking detectors.
  Fitting formulas are given for the global track fit as well as for the local hit triplets.
  The latter allows filtering out triplets with poor fit quality at an early stage of track reconstruction.
  The construction and fit of local triplets is fully parallelizable, enabling accelerated computation with parallel hardware architectures.
  Formulas for the detector-specific triplet parameters are derived for the two most commonly used field configuration for tracking detectors, namely a uniform solenoidal field and gap spectrometer dipole.
  An algorithm to calculate the triplet parameters for an arbitrary magnetic field configuration is presented too.
  This paper also includes a discussion of inherent track fit biases.
  Furthermore, a new method is proposed to accelerate track fitting by classifying tracking regimes and using optimal fit formulas.</description>
