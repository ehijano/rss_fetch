      <title>A novel neural network-based approach to derive a geomagnetic baseline for robust characterization of geomagnetic indices at mid-latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomagnetic indices derived from ground magnetic measurements characterize the intensity of solar-terrestrial interaction. The \textit{Kp} index derived from multiple magnetic observatories at mid-latitude has commonly been used for space weather operations. Yet, its temporal cadence is low and its intensity scale is crude. To derive a new generation of geomagnetic indices, it is desirable to establish a geomagnetic `baseline' that defines the quiet-level of activity without solar-driven perturbations. We present a new approach for deriving a baseline that represents the time-dependent quiet variations focusing on data from Chambon-la-For\^et, France. Using a filtering technique, the measurements are first decomposed into the above-diurnal variation and the sum of 24h, 12h, 8h, and 6h filters, called the daily variation. Using correlation tools and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify parameters that dominantly correlate with the daily variation. Here, we predict the daily `quiet' variation using a long short-term memory neural network trained using at least 11 years of data at 1h cadence. This predicted daily quiet variation is combined with linear extrapolation of the secular trend associated with the intrinsic geomagnetic variability, which dominates the above-diurnal variation, to yield a new geomagnetic baseline. Unlike the existing baselines, our baseline is insensitive to geomagnetic storms. It is thus suitable for defining geomagnetic indices that accurately reflect the intensity of solar-driven perturbations. Our methodology is quick to implement and scalable, making it suitable for real-time operation. Strategies for operational forecasting of our geomagnetic baseline 1 day and 27 days in advance are presented.</description>

      <title>Radial Evolution of ICME-Associated Particle Acceleration Observed by Solar Orbiter and ACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 2022 March 10, a coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the Sun, resulting in Solar Orbiter observations at 0.45 au of both dispersive solar energetic particles arriving prior to the interplanetary CME (ICME) and locally accelerated particles near the ICME-associated shock structure as it passed the spacecraft on 2022 March 11. This shock was later detected on 2022 March 14 by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), which was radially aligned with Solar Orbiter, at 1 au. Ion composition data from both spacecraft -- via the Solar Orbiter Energetic Particle Detector/ Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (EPD/SIS) and the Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on ACE -- allows for in-depth analysis of the radial evolution of species-dependent ICME shock-associated acceleration processes for this event. We present a study of the ion spectra observed at 0.45 and 1 au during both the gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) and energetic storm particle (ESP) phases of the event. We find that the shapes of the spectra seen at each spacecraft have significant differences that were likely caused by varying shock geometry: Solar Orbiter spectra tend to lack spectral breaks, and the higher energy portions of the ACE spectra have comparable average flux to the Solar Orbiter spectra. Through an analysis of rigidity effects on the spectral breaks observed by ACE, we conclude that the 1 au observations were largely influenced by a suprathermal pool of $\mathrm{He}^{+}$ ions that were enhanced due to propagation along a stream interaction region (SIR) that was interacting with the ICME at times of observation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Runcorn's theorem and crustal magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the era of NASA's Apollo missions Keith S.~Runcorn proposed an explanation of discrepancy between the Moon's negligible global magnetic field and magnetised samples of lunar regolith, based on identical vanishing of external magnetic field of a spherical shell, magnetized by an internal source which is no longer present. We revisit and generalize the Runcorn's result, showing that it is a consequence of a (weighted) orthogonality of gradients of harmonic functions on a spherical shell in arbitrary number of dimensions. Furthermore, we explore bounds on external magnetic field in the case when the idealized spherical shell is replaced with a more realistic geometric shape and when the thermoremanent magnetization susceptibility deviates from the spherical symmetry. Finally, we analyse a model of thermoremanent magnetization acquired by crustal inward cooling of a spherical astrophysical body and put some general bounds on the associated magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Study of magnetic reconnection at low-$\beta$ using laser-powered capacitor coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles. Over the past decade, a new experimental platform has been developed to study magnetic reconnection using strong coil currents powered by high power lasers at low plasma beta, typical conditions under which reconnection is energetically important in astrophysics. KJ-class lasers were used to drive parallel currents to reconnect MG-level magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry, similar to the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment or MRX, and thus this platform is named micro-MRX. This presentation summarizes two major findings from micro-MRX: direct measurement of accelerated electrons and observation of ion acoustic waves during anti-parallel reconnection. The angular dependence of the measured electron energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that direct acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Furthermore, a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts has been measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of magnetic reconnection, followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. These results demonstrate that the micro-MRX platform offers a novel and unique approach to study magnetic reconnection in the laboratory in addition to the capabilities provided by traditional magnetized plasma experiments such as MRX and the upcoming FLARE (Facility for Laboratory Reconnection experiments). Future approaches to study other particle acceleration mechanisms and ion acoustic waves from magnetic reconnection are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A solar rotation signature in cosmic dust: frequency analysis of dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust particle impacts on the Wind spacecraft were detected with its plasma wave instrument Wind/WAVES. Frequency analysis on this dust impact time series revealed spectral peaks indicative of a solar rotation signature. We investigated whether this solar rotation signature is embedded in the interplanetary or interstellar dust (ISD) and whether it is caused by co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), by the sector structure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), or by external effects. We performed frequency analysis on subsets of the data to investigate the origin of these spectral peaks, comparing segments of Wind's orbit when the spacecraft moved against or with the ISD inflow direction and comparing the time periods of the ISD focusing and defocusing phases of the solar magnetic cycle. A superposed epoch analysis of the number of dust impacts during CIRs was used to investigate the systematic effect of CIRs. Case studies of time periods with frequent or infrequent occurrences of CIRs were compared to synthetic data of dust impacts affected by CIRs. We performed similar case studies for time periods with a stable or chaotic IMF sector structure. The superposed epoch analysis was repeated for a time series of the spacecraft floating potential. Spectral peaks were found at the solar rotation period of ~27d and its harmonics at 13.5d and 9d. This solar rotation signature may affect both interplanetary and ISD. The appearance of this signature correlates with the occurrence of CIRs but not with the stability of the IMF sector structure. The CIRs cause, on average, a reduction in the number of dust impact detections. Periodic changes of the spacecraft's floating potential were found to partially counteract this reduction by enhancing the instrument's sensitivity to dust impacts; these changes of the floating potential are thus unlikely to be the cause of the solar rotation signature.</description>
