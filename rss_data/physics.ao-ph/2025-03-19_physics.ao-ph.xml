      <title>Improving the quasi-biennial oscillation via a surrogate-accelerated multi-objective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the QBO remains a formidable challenge partly due to uncertainties in representing convectively generated gravity waves. We develop an end-to-end uncertainty quantification workflow that calibrates these gravity wave processes in E3SM to yield a more realistic QBO. Central to our approach is a domain knowledge-informed, compressed representation of high-dimensional spatio-temporal wind fields. By employing a parsimonious statistical model that learns the fundamental frequency of the underlying stochastic process from complex observations, we extract a concise set of interpretable and physically meaningful quantities of interest capturing key attributes, such as oscillation amplitude and period. Building on this, we train a probabilistic surrogate model. Leveraging the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition, our surrogate efficiently represents these characteristics as a set of orthogonal features, thereby capturing the cross-correlations among multiple physics quantities evaluated at different stratospheric pressure levels, and enabling rapid surrogate-based inference at a fraction of the computational cost of inference reliant only on full-scale simulations. Finally, we analyze the inverse problem using a multi-objective approach. Our study reveals a tension between amplitude and period that constrains the QBO representation, precluding a single optimal solution that simultaneously satisfies both objectives. To navigate this challenge, we quantify the bi-criteria trade-off and generate a representative set of Pareto optimal physics parameter values that balance the conflicting objectives. This integrated workflow not only improves the fidelity of QBO simulations but also advances toward a practical framework for tuning modes of variability and quasi-periodic phenomena, offering a versatile template for uncertainty quantification in complex geophysical models.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 15 degrees can experience average residuals of 12.4 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 155 degrees at distances below 1500 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 10 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than two degrees beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>

      <title>Towards Location-Specific Precipitation Projections Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimates at individual locations are crucial for weather forecasting and spatial analysis. This study presents a paradigm shift by leveraging Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to surpass traditional methods like Kriging for station-specific precipitation approximation. We propose two innovative NN architectures: one utilizing precipitation, elevation, and location, and another incorporating additional meteorological parameters like humidity, temperature, and wind speed. Trained on a vast dataset (1980-2019), these models outperform Kriging across various evaluation metrics (correlation coefficient, root mean square error, bias, and skill score) on a five-year validation set. This compelling evidence demonstrates the transformative power of deep learning for spatial prediction, offering a robust and precise alternative for station-specific precipitation estimation.</description>

      <title>Performance of fiber-based QAM/FSO systems in turbulence with anisotropic tilt angle and random angular jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, the subsistent anisotropic non-Kolmogorov (ANK) turbulence models are all established on the supposition that the long axis of turbulence cell ought to be level with the ground. Nevertheless, Beason et al. and Wang et al. have illustrated through their recent experimental results that there is an anisotropic tilt angle in the turbulence cell, i.e., the long axis of turbulence cell is probably not level with the ground but has a particular angle with the ground. For the practical free-space optical (FSO) communication link, bias error and random angular jitter are critical elements which influence the fiber-based FSO communication system performance. In this paper, employing the new ANK turbulence spectrum models in the horizontal link with anisotropic tilt angle, we derive the normalized probability density function (PDF) for Gamma-Gamma distribution with anisotropic tilt angle, and the PDF of fiber-coupling efficiency in the presence of bias error, anisotropic tilt angle, and random angular jitter. And then the average bit error rate (BER) expression of fiber-based J*Q rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) FSO systems for a plane wave transmission through the weak ANK horizontal link in the presence of bias error, anisotropic tilt angle, and random angular jitter is developed.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Circulation of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets: The Diabatic Equivalent-Barotropic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the description of equivalent-barotropic equations for exoplanets to the diabatic case -- that is, with explicit heating and/or cooling representation, rather than with a stationary deflection of the bottom bounding surface. In the diabatic case, the equation for potential temperature (or entropy) is directly forced and cannot be decoupled from the equations for momentum and nonlinear pressure, the mass-like variable; and, the isentropic surfaces do not remain coincident with material surfaces. Here the formalism is presented for an atmosphere with the Lamb vertical structure, as the formalism is substantially simplified under the structure. The equations presented set the stage for accurate global simulations which permit small-scale vortices, gravity waves, and fronts observed in current three-dimensional global simulations to be studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Challenges in assessing Fire Weather changes in a warming climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) is widely used to assess wildfire danger and relies on meteorological data at local noon. However, climate models often provide only daily aggregated data, which poses a challenge for accurate FWI calculations in climate change studies. Here, we examine how using daily approximations for FWI95d -- the annual count of extreme fire weather days exceeding the 95th percentile of local daily FWI values -- compares to the standard noon-based approach for the period 1980--2023.
  Our findings reveal that FWI95d calculated with noon-specific data increased globally by approximately 65\%, corresponding to 11.66 additional extreme fire weather days over 44 years. In contrast, daily approximations tend to overestimate these trends by 5--10\%, with combinations involving minimum relative humidity showing the largest divergences. Globally, up to 15 million km$^2$, particularly in the western United States, southern Africa, and parts of Asia, exhibit significant overestimations. Among our daily approximation methods, the least biased proxy is the one that uses daily mean data for all variables.
  We recommend (i) prioritizing the inclusion of sub-daily meteorological data in future climate model intercomparison projects to enhance FWI accuracy, and (ii) adopting daily mean approximations as the least-biased alternative if noon-specific data are unavailable.</description>
