      <description>arXiv:2505.03834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is an update to our earlier paper ''Progress toward fusion energy breakeven and gain as measured against the Lawson criterion'' [Phys. Plasmas 29, 062103 (2022)]. Plots of Lawson parameter and triple product vs. ion temperature and triple product vs. date achieved are updated with recently published experimental results. A new plot of scientific energy gain vs. date achieved is included. Additionally, notes on new experimental results, clarifications, and a correction are included.</description>

      <title>Self-Propelled Agents and Group Social Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>

      <title>Core-periphery detection in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems that capture different types of interactions between the same set of entities across multiple layers. Core-periphery detection involves partitioning the nodes of a network into core nodes, which are highly connected across the network, and peripheral nodes, which are densely connected to the core but sparsely connected among themselves. In this paper, we propose a new model of core-periphery in multilayer network and a nonlinear spectral method that simultaneously detects the corresponding core and periphery structures of both nodes and layers in weighted and directed multilayer networks. Our method reveals novel structural insights in three empirical multilayer networks from distinct application areas: the citation network of complex network scientists, the European airlines transport network, and the world trade network.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>On some pioneering Usenet newsgroups in astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundation of two very early Usenet newsgroups in astrophysics, still existent today, and some milestones in their history have been tracked from the origins at Princeton University in 1983 to 1994. They result to be pioneering experiences in this discipline, and among the earliest ones of this kind in academic disciplines at large. To the best of our knowledge, an account of their birth and evolution is given here for the first time. Following key recommendations from the recent discipline of web history, this research has combined multiple and different-type sources, building mainly on online archives of Usenet newsgroups and on human contributions from the concerned scholarly community. A final overview is proposed on how these early online communication tools have been perceived and used by the scholarly community involved. This research reconstructs computer mediated communication experiences which were at risk of being forgotten; provides a view of this environment's uptake of new communication technology; and contributes knowledge of some social dynamics of the astrophysics community in the last twenty years of the twentieth century.</description>

      <title>Inference accuracy about an aircraft crash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problem-based learning benefits from situations taken from real life, which arouse student interest. The shooting of Rwanda president aircraft on April 6th, 1994 is still unsolved. We discuss the methods to infer information and conclusions about where the aircraft was shot and its trajectory during its fall, as well as about the place from which the missiles were launched, and their trajectory and type. To this goal, we compiled expert reports, witness indications and other public sources, then translated plain language sentences into quantitative equalities and inequalities applied to geometry and mechanics at undergraduate level. The accuracy of each result is discussed and propagated in order to ensure a proper assessment of the hypotheses and a traceability of their consequences. Overall, the accuracy discussion can train the students critical mind, and teach inference methods which are routinely used in several fields of physics research. In addition, it demonstrates the importance and limits of scientific expertise during a judiciary process.</description>
