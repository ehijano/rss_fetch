      <title>System Architecture Optimization Strategies: Dealing with Expensive Hierarchical Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choosing the right system architecture for the problem at hand is challenging due to the large design space and high uncertainty in the early stage of the design process. Formulating the architecting process as an optimization problem may mitigate some of these challenges. This work investigates strategies for solving System Architecture Optimization (SAO) problems: expensive, black-box, hierarchical, mixed-discrete, constrained, multi-objective problems that may be subject to hidden constraints. Imputation ratio, correction ratio, correction fraction, and max rate diversity metrics are defined for characterizing hierar chical design spaces. This work considers two classes of optimization algorithms for SAO: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA) such as NSGA-II, and Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithms. A new Gaussian process kernel is presented that enables modeling hierarchical categorical variables, extending previous work on modeling continuous and integer hierarchical variables. Next, a hierarchical sampling algorithm that uses design space hierarchy to group design vectors by active design variables is developed. Then, it is demonstrated that integrating more hierarchy information in the optimization algorithms yields better optimization results for BO algorithms. Several realistic single-objective and multi-objective test problems are used for investigations. Finally, the BO algorithm is applied to a jet engine architecture optimization problem. This work shows that the developed BO algorithm can effectively solve the problem with one order of magnitude less function evaluations than NSGA-II. The algorithms and problems used in this work are implemented in the open-source Python library SBArchOpt.</description>

      <title>Effective Sampling for Robot Motion Planning Through the Lens of Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based methods for motion planning, which capture the structure of the robot's free space via (typically random) sampling, have gained popularity due to their scalability, simplicity, and for offering global guarantees, such as probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. Unfortunately, the practicality of those guarantees remains limited as they do not provide insights into the behavior of motion planners for a finite number of samples (i.e., a finite running time). In this work, we harness lattice theory and the concept of $(\delta,\epsilon)$-completeness by Tsao et al. (2020) to construct deterministic sample sets that endow their planners with strong finite-time guarantees while minimizing running time. In particular, we introduce a highly-efficient deterministic sampling approach based on the $A_d^*$ lattice, which is the best-known geometric covering in dimensions $\leq 21$. Using our new sampling approach, we obtain at least an order-of-magnitude speedup over existing deterministic and uniform random sampling methods for complex motion-planning problems. Overall, our work provides deep mathematical insights while advancing the practical applicability of sampling-based motion planning.</description>

      <title>Computing and Learning on Combinatorial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The twenty-first century is a data-driven era where human activities and behavior, physical phenomena, scientific discoveries, technology advancements, and almost everything that happens in the world resulting in massive generation, collection, and utilization of data.
  Connectivity in data is a crucial property. A straightforward example is the World Wide Web, where every webpage is connected to other web pages through hyperlinks, providing a form of directed connectivity. Combinatorial data refers to combinations of data items based on certain connectivity rules. Other forms of combinatorial data include social networks, meshes, community clusters, set systems, and molecules.
  This Ph.D. dissertation focuses on learning and computing with combinatorial data. We study and examine topological and connectivity features within and across connected data to improve the performance of learning and achieve high algorithmic efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Randomised Approach to Distributed Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a new, extremely simple, randomised sorting algorithm:
  - choose a pair of indices $\{i, j\}$ according to some distribution $q$;
  - sort the elements in positions $i$ and $j$ of the array in ascending order.
  Choosing $q_{\{i,j\}} \propto 1/|j - i|$ yields an order-$n (\log n)^2$ sorting time. We call it the harmonic sorter.
  The sorter trivially parallelises in the asynchronous setting, yielding a linear speed-up. We also exhibit a low-communication, synchronous version with a linear speed-up.
  We compare and contrast this algorithm with other sorters, and discuss some of its benefits, particularly its robustness and amenability to parallelisation and distributed computing.</description>

      <title>The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem.
  Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</description>

      <title>Monitoring arc-geodetic sets of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring edge-geodetic sets in a graph are subsets of vertices such that every edge of the graph must lie on all the shortest paths between two vertices of the monitoring set. These objects were introduced in a work by Foucaud, Krishna and Ramasubramony Sulochana with relation to several prior notions in the area of network monitoring like distance edge-monitoring.
  In this work, we explore the extension of those notions unto oriented graphs, modelling oriented networks, and call these objects monitoring arc-geodetic sets. We also define the lower and upper monitoring arc-geodetic number of an undirected graph as the minimum and maximum of the monitoring arc-geodetic number of all orientations of the graph. We determine the monitoring arc-geodetic number of fundamental graph classes such as bipartite graphs, trees, cycles, etc. Then, we characterize the graphs for which every monitoring arc-geodetic set is the entire set of vertices, and also characterize the solutions for tournaments. We also cover some complexity aspects by studying two algorithmic problems. We show that the problem of determining if an undirected graph has an orientation with the minimal monitoring arc-geodetic set being the entire set of vertices, is NP-hard. We also show that the problem of finding a monitoring arc-geodetic set of size at most $k$ is $NP$-complete when restricted to oriented graphs with maximum degree $4$.</description>

      <title>Chorded cycle facets of the clique partitioning polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities are a class of valid inequalities for the clique partitioning polytope. It is known that for $q \in \{2, \tfrac{k-1}{2}\}$, these inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if $k$ is odd. Here, we characterize such facets for arbitrary $k$ and $q$. More specifically, we prove that the $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if two conditions are satisfied: $k = 1$ mod $q$, and if $k=3q+1$ then $q=3$ or $q$ is even. This establishes the existence of many facets induced by $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities beyond those previously known.</description>

      <title>A linear-time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a randomized algorithm that, given a constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a proper $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring of an $m$-edge simple graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta \geq 1/\epsilon$ in $O(m)$ time with high probability. This is the first linear-time algorithm for this problem covering the full range of possible values of $\Delta$. Indeed, even for edge-coloring with $2\Delta - 1$ colors (i.e., meeting the "greedy" bound), no such linear-time algorithm has been previously known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{H}$. Let $S_{t,t,t}$ be the graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing each edge $t-1$ times, and let $W_{t\times t}$ be the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid. Let $\mathcal{L}_t$ be the family of all graphs $G$ such that $G$ is the line graph of some subdivision of $W_{t \times t}$. We prove that for every positive integer $t$ there exists $c(t)$ such that every $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t}, K_{t,t}\}$-free $n$-vertex graph admits a tree decomposition in which the maximum size of an independent set in each bag is at most $c(t)\log^4n$. This is a variant of a conjecture of Dallard, Krnc, Kwon, Milani\v{c}, Munaro, \v{S}torgel, and Wiederrecht from 2024. This implies that the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, as well as many other natural algorithmic problems, that are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t},K_{t,t}\}$-free. As part of our proof, we show that for every positive integer $t$ there exists an integer $d$ such that every $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t}\}$-free graph admits a balanced separator that is contained in the neighborhood of at most $d$ vertices.</description>
