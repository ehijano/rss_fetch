      <title>$\eta$ and $\eta'$ meson production in $J/\psi$ radiative decays from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the computation of amplitudes describing the radiative decay processes $J/\psi \to \gamma \, \eta$ and $J/\psi \to \gamma \, \eta'$ from first principles via lattice QCD. Using lattices with two degenerate flavors of light quark and a heavier strange quark where $m_\pi \sim 391$ MeV, we compute three-point correlation functions using optimized meson operators with a range of momenta. The use of optimized operators allows access to the $\eta'$, even though it appears as an excited state, lying above the ground-state $\eta$ in the isoscalar pseudoscalar channel. Statistically precise signals are obtained in this disconnected process by averaging over large numbers of kinematically equivalent correlators. We determine transition form-factors as a function of photon virtuality across the timelike region, which describe also the 'Dalitz' processes $J/\psi \to e^+ e^- \, \eta^{(\prime)}$. Significantly lower magnitudes of transition form-factor for both the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ are found than those extracted from experimental data, and possible explanations for this observation are presented.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ and $\eta'$ production in $J/\psi$ radiative decays from quantum chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first principles calculation within quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of the radiative decays of the $J/\psi$ into the light pseudoscalar mesons $\eta$ and $\eta'$. Within a lattice computation we obtain the transition form-factors as a function of photon virtuality from the timelike region, accessible experimentally via the 'Dalitz' decay $J/\psi \to e^+ e^-\, \eta^{(\prime)} $, through to the real photon point corresponding to $J/\psi \to \gamma\, \eta^{(\prime)} $. This is the first calculation in lattice QCD with two (heavier than physical) degenerate flavors of light quark and a heavier strange quark, in which the $\eta'$ appears as the first-excited state with pseudoscalar isoscalar quantum numbers. We access it reliably by using variationally optimized operators, use of which also improves the purity of the $J/\psi$ and $\eta$ signals, reducing systematic uncertainties. High quality results at a large number of kinematic points are obtained in a typically noisy disconnected process by using a novel correlator averaging procedure. Our results show the expected enhanced production of the $\eta'$ over the $\eta$ in this process, and suggest that the demonstrated lattice technology is suitable for future calculations considering processes in which light meson resonances are produced.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Sampling for Lattice Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate lattice scalar field theory in two-dimensional Euclidean space via a quantum annealer. To accommodate the quartic interaction terms, we introduce three schemes for rewriting them as quadratic polynomials through the use of auxiliary qubits. These methods are applied on D-Wave quantum annealer, and their effectiveness is assessed by examining the annealer-generated distributions. Using these distributions, we perform Monte Carlo sampling via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and compare the outcomes with those from classical Metropolis simulations.</description>

      <title>A new approach to quark mass determination using the gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine quark masses using ratios of the vacuum-expectation values (VEVs) of flowed quark bilinear operators. They can be expressed as functions of the flow time $t$ and the ${\overline {\rm MS}}$ quark mass $\overline{m}$, which can then be determined by matching with the corresponding lattice results. Motivated by this, we evaluate these VEVs perturbatively through next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. We provide the results as expansions in the limits of small and large $\overline{m}^2 t$. To this end, we develop a new expansion technique based on the Laplace transform. Additionally, we present numerical results with the exact mass dependence over a wide range of $\overline{m}^2t$. We discuss the expected perturbative precision for the mass determination based on our next-to-leading order perturbative calculations, and possible non-perturbative corrections.</description>

      <title>Commutator-free Lie group methods with minimum storage requirements and reuse of exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.04225v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new format for commutator-free Lie group methods is proposed based on explicit classical Runge-Kutta schemes. In this format exponentials are reused at every stage and the storage is required only for two quantities: the right hand side of the differential equation evaluated at a given Runge-Kutta stage and the function value updated at the same stage. The next stage of the scheme is able to overwrite these values. The result is proven for a 3-stage third order method and a conjecture for higher order methods is formulated. Five numerical examples are provided in support of the conjecture. This new class of structure-preserving integrators has a wide variety of applications for numerically solving differential equations on manifolds.</description>

      <title>Holography for QCD(Adj) and QCD(Adj)+F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in SU(Nc) gauge theories with fermions in the adjoint representation. There has been considerable work on studying these theories compactified on a small circle (with compactification scale 1/L large relative to the strong coupling scale of the theory). The weakly coupled IR theory of photons exhibits confinement through a density of magnetically charged instanton configurations. As the compactification scale 1/L approaches the strong coupling scale, the IR theory becomes strongly coupled. In this regime we propose a holographic description of the IR degrees of freedom. The instanton condensation scale can be associated with a scale at which the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound is violated in the model and the glueball spectrum computed. We can also introduce the adjoint fermions which holographically display a BF bound violation associated to their running anomalous dimension. Very naively extending the perturbative results to the non-perturbative regime suggests that chiral symmetry breaking might occur ahead of confinement, but equally they may be joined phenomena. If the two phenomena are separate, then it would be useful to be able to enlarge the gap in scales. We propose adding fermions in the fundamental representation as well, which in a holographic model (that favours this separation) can greatly enlarge the gap to an order of magnitude. These results challenge the lattice community to seek such scale gaps (or their absence) to further understand the confining and chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</description>

      <title>Direct Monte Carlo Computation of the 't~Hooft Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 't~Hooft partition function~$\mathcal{Z}_{\text{tH}}[E;B]$ of an $SU(N)$ gauge theory with the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry is defined as the Fourier transform of the partition function~$\mathcal{Z}[B]$ with respect to the spatial-temporal components of the 't~Hooft flux~$B$. Its large volume behavior detects the quantum phase of the system. When the integrand of the functional integral is real-positive, the latter partition function~$\mathcal{Z}[B]$ can be numerically computed by a Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, just by counting the number of configurations of a specific 't~Hooft flux~$B$. We carry out this program for the $SU(2)$ pure Yang--Mills theory with the vanishing $\theta$-angle by employing a newly-developed hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm (the halfway HMC) for the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory. The numerical result clearly shows that all non-electric fluxes are ``light'' as expected in the ordinary confining phase with the monopole condensate. Invoking the Witten effect on~$\mathcal{Z}_{\text{tH}}[E;B]$, this also indicates the oblique confinement at~$\theta=2\pi$ with the dyon condensate.</description>

      <title>$bb\bar u\bar d$ and $bs\bar u\bar d$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using two-meson and diquark-antidiquark variational basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of isoscalar tetraquark systems involving bottom quarks with explicit flavor content $bb\bar{u}\bar{d}$ and $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$. In the doubly bottom sector, the study focuses on axialvector $J^P=1^+$ quantum numbers, whereas in the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel both axial vector $J^P=1^+$ and scalar $J^P=0^+$ quantum numbers are investigated in search of signatures for possible tetraquark bound states. The calculations are performed on four ensembles with dynamical quark fields up to the charm quark generated by the MILC Collaboration, with lattice spacings ranging from approximately 0.058 fm to 0.12 fm, and at different values of the valence light quark mass $m_{u/d}$, corresponding to pseudoscalar meson masses, $M_{ps}$=0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 GeV. The energy eigenvalues in the finite volume are determined by applying a variational procedure to correlation matrices constructed from two-meson interpolating operators and diquark-antidiquark operators. Continuum extrapolated elastic $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of $BB^*$, $KB^*$ and $KB$ are extracted from the ground state eigenenergies following a finite-volume analysis \'a la L\"uscher. The chiral and continuum extrapolated binding energy estimates for the isoscalar axialvector doubly bottom tetraquark $T_{bb}$ from the extracted elastic $BB^*$ $S$-wave scattering amplitudes is found to be $\Delta E_{T_{bb}}(1^+)=-116(^{+30}_{-36})$ MeV. In the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$, no statistically significant deviations were observed in the ground state energies from the respective elastic threshold energies, leading to no conclusive evidence for any bound states.</description>

      <title>SU($2$) string tension in the continuum limit using an effective theory of center vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an effective theory for an ensemble of center vortices, we observe the area law fall-off in the continuum limit for the SU($2$) gauge group in three-dimensional Euclidean space-time. The string tension is obtained in terms of the intrinsic properties of the vortices and a parameter which describes their interactions. In addition, fitting our analytical results on lattice data, we show that the repulsive force between the vortices increases with temperature. This behavior is expected due to the reduction of vortex configuration at higher temperatures, required for the deconfinement regime.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering in presence of non-standard interactions: cross sections and nucleon polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) may appear in the form of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). We have studied neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering in presence of NSI. We obtain that in this scenario, nucleon matrix elements depend not only on the isovector axial nucleon form factor but also on the isoscalar one. For the axial form factors we consequently rely on the quark flavor decomposition performed by QCD simulations in the lattice (LQCD). We have examined cross sections and polarization observables. For the current bounds on diagonal muon flavor NSI couplings we find substantial deviations from the SM predictions in cross sections and transverse polarizations of the outgoing nucleons. In view of the progress in the precision of LQCD determinations of nucleon properties, modern measurements of neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering will be in the position to discover or significantly constrain NSI.</description>
