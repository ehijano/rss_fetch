      <title>Maslov class of exact Lagrangians and cylindrical handles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental and deep result in symplectic topology due to Abouzaid and Kragh states that the Maslov class vanishes for closed exact Lagrangians in cotangent bundles of closed manifolds. In this article we prove by an explicit construction that the Maslov class does not vanish in general for closed exact Lagrangians in Weinstein domains obtained by performing a critical handle attachment to a cotangent bundle. We also define cylindrical handles as a generalization of Weinstein handles.</description>

      <title>Retraction maps: A seed of geometric integrators. Part II: Symmetry and reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use retraction and discretization maps (see [Barbero Li\~n\'an and Mart\'in de Diego, 2022]) as a tool for deriving in a systematic way numerical integrators preserving geometric structures (such as symplecticity or Lie-Poisson structure), as well as methods that preserve symmetry and the associated discrete momentum map. The classical notion of a retraction map leads to the notion of discretization map extended here to the Lie algebroid of a Lie groupoid so that the configuration manifold is discretized, instead of the equations of motion. As a consequence, geometric integrators are obtained preserving the Lie-Poisson structure of the corresponding reduced system.</description>

      <title>On the Hofer-Zehnder conjecture for non-contractible periodic orbits in Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.05273v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat an open problem related to the number of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed symplectic manifolds. Hofer-Zehnder conjecture states that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms has infinitely many periodic orbits if it has "homologically unnecessary periodic orbits"". For example, non-contractible periodic orbits are homologically unnecessary periodic orbits because Floer homology of non-contractible periodic orbits is trivial. We prove Hofer-Zehnder conjecture for non-contractible periodic orbits for very wide classes of symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Cosymplectic groupoids by cosymplectic moment maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction has an analogous version for cosymplectic manifolds. In this paper we extend this cosymplectic reduction to the context of groupoids. Moreover, we prove how in the case of an algebroid associated to a cosymplectic groupoid, the integration commutes with the reduction (analogously to what happens in Poisson geometry). On the other hand, we show how the cosymplectic reduction of a groupoid induces a symplectic reduction on a canonical symplectic subgroupoid. Finally, we study what happens to the multiplicative Chern class associated with the $S^1$-central extensions of the reduced groupoid.</description>

      <title>On Fukaya categories and prequantization bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show: the Floer homology over the Novikov ring of (nonexact!) rational Lagrangians in an (nonexact!) integral symplectic manifold can be computed in terms of exact Lagrangians in an exact filling of the prequantization bundle. As a consequence, we give a Fukaya-sheaf correspondence for rational (nonexact!) Lagrangians in Weinstein manifolds, as conjectured by Ike and the first-named author. We also show that bounding cochains for immersed rational Lagrangians transform naturally under Legendrian isotopy, as conjectured by Akaho and Joyce. As an illustration, we show that quantum cohomology of the complex projective line -- which requires the counting of one holomorphic sphere -- can be recovered from purely sheaf-theoretic calculations.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and Weierstrass-Williamson theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the foundations of the local linear symplectic geometry of $p$-adic integrable systems on $p$-adic analytic symplectic $4$\--dimensional manifolds, by classifiying all their possible local linear models. In order to do this we develop a new approach, of independent interest, to the theory of Weierstrass and Williamson concerning the diagonalization of real matrices by real symplectic matrices. We show that this approach can be generalized to $p$\--adic matrices, leading to a classification of real $(2n)$-by-$(2n)$ matrices and of $p$-adic $2$-by-$2$ and $4$-by-$4$ matrix normal forms, including, up to dimension $4$, the classification in the degenerate case, for which the literature is limited even in the real case. A combination of these results and the Hardy-Ramanujan formula shows that both the number of $p$-adic matrix normal forms and the number of local linear models of $p$-adic integrable systems grow almost exponentially with their dimensions, in strong contrast with the real case. The paper also includes a number of results concerning symplectic linear algebra over arbitrary fields in arbitrary dimensions as well as applications to $p$-adic mechanical systems and singularity theory for $p$-adic analytic maps on $4$-manifolds. These results fit in a program, proposed a decade ago by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author, to develop a $p$-adic theory of integrable systems with the goal of later implementing it using proof assistants.</description>
