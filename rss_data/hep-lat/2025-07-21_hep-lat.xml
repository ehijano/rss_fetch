      <title>Quark + Diquark Description of Nucleon Elastic Electromagnetic Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with a Poincar\'e-covariant quark + diquark, $q(qq)$, Faddeev equation approach to nucleon structure, a refined symmetry preserving current for electron + nucleon elastic scattering is developed. The parameters in the interaction current are chosen to ensure that the $q(qq)$ picture reproduces selected results from contemporary $3$-body analyses of nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors. Although the subset of fitted results is small, the $q(qq)$ picture reproduces almost all the $3$-body predictions and often results in better agreement with available data. Notably, the $q(qq)$ framework predicts a zero in $G_E^p/G_M^p$, the absence of such a zero in $G_E^n/G_M^n$, and a zero in the proton's $d$-quark Dirac form factor. Derived $q(qq)$ results for proton flavour-separated light-front-transverse number and anomalous magnetisation densities are also discussed. With the $q(qq)$ framework thus newly benchmarked, one may proceed to comparisons with a broader array of $3$-body results. This may enable new steps to be made toward answering an important question, viz. is the quark + fully-interacting diquark picture of baryon structure only a useful phenomenology or does it come close to expressing robust features of baryon structure?</description>

      <title>$\pi^0\rightarrow 2\gamma$ decay under strong magnetic fields in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalous $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ decay under an external uniform magnetic field in the framework of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is seen that the full decay width gets strongly reduced with the external field, and that the differential width is almost independent of thedirection of the outgoing photons. We also find that the result for the total width can be very well approximated by a simple expression obtained at the lowest order in the chiral limit, which is just a direct extension to finite magnetic fields of the well known $B=0$ result that follows from the anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten action. As a result, the magnetic suppression of the width can be understood in terms of the evolution of both the neutral pion mass and decay constant with the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Triply heavy tetraquarks $\bar{b}c\bar{q}c$ and $\bar{c}b\bar{q}b$ in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic investigation of $S$-wave triply heavy tetraquark systems with quark content $\bar{b}c\bar{q}c$ and $\bar{c}b\bar{q}b$ $(q = u,\,d,\,s)$, spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$, $2^+$ and isospin $I=0,\,\frac{1}{2}$, is carried out within the constituent quark model framework. The four-body bound and resonance states are determined by solving the Schr\"odinger equation employing the high-precision and efficient Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) in conjunction with the powerful Complex Scaling Method (CSM). Besides, a comprehensive coupled-channel analysis of the $S$-wave tetraquark systems is performed, taking into account meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type configurations, as well as all allowed color structures. Several narrow resonant states are identified in each $I(J^P)$ channel. In particular, resonances for the $\bar{b}c\bar{q}c$ system are found in the mass range of $8.87-9.36$ GeV, while those for the $\bar{c}b\bar{q}b$ system lie between $12.13-12.45$ GeV. Most of the predicted resonances are compact tetraquark states with sizes smaller than $1.0$ fm, although four states exhibit more extended structures with sizes around $1.3$ fm, suggesting a more loosely bound nature. Magnetic moments and dominant wave function components of these exotic states are also analyzed. The results indicate that K-type configurations play a major role in the structure of the observed resonances. Finally, possible strong decay channels (golden modes) for these states are theoretically proposed.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing relativistic three-body partial wave amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S matrix principles and symmetries impose constraints on three-particle scattering amplitudes, which can be formulated as a class of integral equations for their partial wave projections. However, these amplitudes are typically expressed in an asymmetric basis, where one of the initial and final state particles is singled out, and all quantum numbers are defined relative to this spectator. In this work, we show how to construct symmetric partial wave amplitudes, which have been symmetrized over all possible spectator combinations, using their asymmetric counterparts and sets of recoupling coefficients. We derive these recoupling coefficients for arbitrary angular momentum and isospin for arbitrary systems of spinless particles with SU(2) flavor symmetry. We propose a simple intensity observable suitable for visualizing the structure of three-body dynamics in Dalitz distributions. Finally, we provide some numerical examples of Dalitz distributions relevant for future lattice QCD calculations of $3\pi$ systems and provide numerical evidence that the symmetrization procedure is consistent with expected symmetries of Dalitz plots.</description>

      <title>Shearing approach to gauge-invariant Trotterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal quantum simulations of gauge field theories are exposed to the risk of gauge symmetry violations when it is not known how to compile the desired operations exactly using the available gate set. In this article, we show how time evolution can be compiled in an Abelian gauge theory -- if only approximately -- without compromising gauge invariance, by graphically motivating a block-diagonalization procedure. When gauge-invariant interactions are associated with a "spatial network" in the space of discrete quantum numbers, it is seen that cyclically shearing the spatial network converts simultaneous updates to many quantum numbers into conditional updates of a single quantum number; ultimately, this eliminates any need to pass through (and acquire overlap onto) unphysical intermediate configurations. Shearing is explicitly applied to gauge-matter and magnetic interactions of lattice quantum electrodynamics. The features that make shearing successful at preserving Abelian gauge symmetry may also be found in non-Abelian theories, bringing one closer to gauge-invariant simulations of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimates of Lee-Yang zeros and a possible critical point on the pion condensate boundary in the QCD isospin phase diagram using an unbiased exponential resummation on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Without invoking any cumulant determination at the input level, we present here the first calculations of direct estimates of the Lee-Yang zeros of QCD partition function in (2+1)-flavor QCD. These zeros are obtained in complex isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$ plane using the unbiased exponential resummation formalism on $N_\tau=8$ lattices and with physical quark masses. For different temperatures, we illustrate the stability of the zeros closest to the origin from which, we subsequently procure the radius of convergence estimates. From the temperature-dependence study of the real and imaginary parts of these zeros, we try estimating one of the possible critical points forming the second order pion condensate critical line in the isospin phase diagram. Further, we compare these resummed estimates with the corresponding Mercer-Roberts estimates of the subsequent Taylor series expansions of the first three partition function cumulants. We also outline comparisons between resummed and Taylor series results of these cumulants for real and imaginary values of $\mu_I$ and highlight the behavior of different expansion orders within and beyond the obtained resummed estimates of radius of convergence. We also re-establish that this resummed radius of convergence can efficiently capture the onset of overlap problem for finite real $\mu_I$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum and magnetic moments of singly-charmed baryons: a quark-diquark model analysis of $\Omega_{c}(3185)^0$ and $\Omega_c(3327)^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on singly-heavy baryons, especially those with a charm quark, offers a distinct perspective on the non-perturbative behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we investigate the recently observed $\Omega_{c}(3185)^{0}$ and $\Omega_{c}(3327)^{0}$ as singly-charmed baryons within the framework of the quark-diquark model. By employing a non-relativistic method with a Cornell-like potential, we systematically determine magnetic moments and mass spectra. Our analysis reveals that the $\Omega_{c}(3185)^{0}$ can be effectively described as a $2S$ state with quantum numbers $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{+}$ or $\frac{3}{2}^{+}$, or alternatively as a $1P$ state with $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ or $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, depending on the diquark configuration. Similarly, the $\Omega_{c}(3327)^{0}$ is consistent with a $2S$ configuration. We also investigate their magnetic moments, emphasizing the critical role of diquark correlations in shaping the electromagnetic properties of these states. Our results not only validate existing theoretical models but also offer new insights into the nature of singly-heavy baryons, setting the stage for future experimental and theoretical investigations in heavy baryon spectroscopy. This paper emphasizes the importance of diquark configurations in elucidating the mass spectrum and electromagnetic characteristics of singly-charmed baryons, aiding in the broader effort to decipher QCD intricacies.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of zero-skewness unpolarized GPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent parameterizations of parton distribution functions (PDFs) have led to the determination of the gravitional form factors of the nucleon's dependence on generalized parton distributions of nucleons in the limit $\xi$$\to 0$. This paper aims to obtain the flavor division of nucleon electromagnetic and gravitional form factors using the VS24 Ansatz and two PDFs at $N^3L0$ approximation in GPDs. The PDFs and GPDs formalism enable the calculation of various form factors of nucleons in different approximations, as well as the calculation of the electric radius of nucleons. The study, despite its high approximation complexity, enhances the accuracy of calculations and brings them closer to the experimental values.</description>
