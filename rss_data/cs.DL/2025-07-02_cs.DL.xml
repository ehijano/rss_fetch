      <title>Digital Collections Explorer: An Open-Source, Multimodal Viewer for Searching Digital Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Digital Collections Explorer, a web-based, open-source exploratory search platform that leverages CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) for enhanced visual discovery of digital collections. Our Digital Collections Explorer can be installed locally and configured to run on a visual collection of interest on disk in just a few steps. Building upon recent advances in multimodal search techniques, our interface enables natural language queries and reverse image searches over digital collections with visual features. This paper describes the system's architecture, implementation, and application to various cultural heritage collections, demonstrating its potential for democratizing access to digital archives, especially those with impoverished metadata. We present case studies with maps, photographs, and PDFs extracted from web archives in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the Digital Collections Explorer, as well as its ease of use. We demonstrate that the Digital Collections Explorer scales to hundreds of thousands of images on a MacBook Pro with an M4 chip. Lastly, we host a public demo of Digital Collections Explorer.</description>

      <title>Gender and Discipline Shape Length, Content and Tone of Grant Peer Review Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer review by experts is central to the evaluation of grant proposals, but little is known about how gender and disciplinary differences shape the content and tone of grant peer review reports. We analyzed 39,280 review reports submitted to the Swiss National Science Foundation between 2016 and 2023, covering 11,385 proposals for project funding across 21 disciplines from the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), Life Sciences (LS), and Mathematics, Informatics, Natural Sciences, and Technology (MINT). Using supervised machine learning, we classified over 1.3 million sentences by evaluation criteria and sentiment. Reviews in SSH were significantly longer and more critical, with less focus on the applicant's track record, while those in MINT were more concise and positive, with a higher focus on the track record, as compared to those in LS. Compared to male reviewers, female reviewers write longer reviews that more closely align with the evaluation criteria and express more positive sentiments. Female applicants tend to receive reviews with slightly more positive sentiment than male applicants. Gender and disciplinary culture influence how grant proposals are reviewed - shaping the tone, length, and focus of peer review reports. These differences have important implications for fairness and consistency in research funding.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and the future of scientometrics: current topics and future questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts, predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling, but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of knowledge production.</description>

      <title>HERITRACE: A User-Friendly Semantic Data Editor with Change Tracking and Provenance Management for Cultural Heritage Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HERITRACE is a data editor designed for galleries, libraries, archives and museums, aimed at simplifying data curation while enabling non-technical domain experts to manage data intuitively without losing its semantic integrity. While the semantic nature of RDF can pose a barrier to data curation due to its complexity, HERITRACE conceals this intricacy while preserving the advantages of semantic representation. The system natively supports provenance management and change tracking, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the curation process. Although HERITRACE functions effectively out of the box, it offers a straightforward customization interface for technical staff, enabling adaptation to the specific data model required by a given collection. Current applications include the ParaText project, and its adoption is already planned for OpenCitations. Future developments will focus on integrating the RDF Mapping Language (RML) to enhance compatibility with non-RDF data formats, further expanding its applicability in digital heritage management.</description>

      <title>Persistence Paradox in Dynamic Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistence is often regarded as a virtue in science. In this paper, however, we challenge this conventional view by highlighting its contextual nature, particularly how persistence can become a liability during periods of paradigm shift. We focus on the deep learning revolution catalyzed by AlexNet in 2012. Analyzing the 20-year career trajectories of over 5,000 scientists who were active in top machine learning venues during the preceding decade, we examine how their research focus and output evolved. We first uncover a dynamic period in which leading venues increasingly prioritized cutting-edge deep learning developments that displaced relatively traditional statistical learning methods. Scientists responded to these changes in markedly different ways. Those who were previously successful or affiliated with old teams adapted more slowly, experiencing what we term a rigidity penalty - a reluctance to embrace new directions leading to a decline in scientific impact, as measured by citation percentile rank. In contrast, scientists who pursued strategic adaptation - selectively pivoting toward emerging trends while preserving weak connections to prior expertise - reaped the greatest benefits. Taken together, our macro- and micro-level findings show that scientific breakthroughs act as mechanisms that reconfigure power structures within a field.</description>

      <title>A Metascience Study of the Low-Code Scientific Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last years, model-related publications have been exploring the application of modeling techniques across various domains. Initially focused on UML and the Model-Driven Architecture approach, the literature has been evolving towards the usage of more general concepts such as Model-Driven Development or Model-Driven Engineering. More recently, however, the term "low-code" has taken the modeling field by storm, largely due to its association with several highly popular development platforms. The research community is still discussing the differences and commonalities between this emerging term and previous modeling-related concepts, as well as the broader implications of low-code on the modeling field. In this paper, we present a metascience study of Low-Code. Our study follows a two-fold approach: (1) to analyze the composition and growth (e.g., size, diversity, venues, and topics) of the emerging Low-Code community; and (2) to explore how these aspects differ from those of the "classical" model-driven community. Ultimately, we hope to trigger a discussion on the current state and potential future trajectory of the low-code community, as well as the opportunities for collaboration and synergies between the low-code and modeling communities.</description>
