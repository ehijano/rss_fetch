      <title>Exact results on the hydrodynamics of certain kinetically-constrained hopping processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of interacting random walkers on a triangular chain and triangular lattice, where a particle can move only if the other two sites of the triangle are unoccupied -- a kinetically-constrained hopping process (KCHP) recently introduced in the context of non-linear diffusion cascades. Using a classical-to-quantum mapping -- where the rate matrix of the stochastic KCHP corresponds to a spin Hamiltonian, and the equilibrium probability distribution to the quantum ground state -- we develop a systematic perturbation theory to calculate the diffusion constant; the hydrodynamics of the KCHPs is determined by the low-energy properties of the spin Hamiltonian, which we analyse with the standard Holstein-Primakoff spin-wave expansion.
  For the triangular hopping we consider, we show that \textit{non-interacting} spin-wave theory predicts the \textit{exact} diffusion constant. We conjecture this holds for all KCHPs with (i) hard-core occupancy, (ii) parity-symmetry, and (iii) where the hopping processes are given by three-site gates -- that is, where hopping between two sites is conditioned on the occupancy of a third. We further show that there are corrections to the diffusion constant when the KCHP is described by \textit{four}-site gates, which we calculate at leading order in the semi-classical $1/S$ expansion. We support all these conclusions with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Averaging -- a Hard Rods Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the example of the integrable hard rods model we study the quality of the (generalized) hydrodynamic approximation on a single coarse-grained sample. This is opposed to the traditional approach which averages over an appropriate local equilibrium state. While mathematically more ambiguous, a major advantage of the new approach is that it allows us to disentangle intrinsic diffusion from `diffusion from convection' effects. For the hard rods we find intrinsic diffusion is absent, which agrees with and clarifies recent findings. Interestingly, the results also apply to not locally thermal states, demonstrating that hydrodynamics (in this model) does not require the assumption of local equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Black-box optimization using factorization and Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) is used in materials design, drug discovery, and hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. The world is experiencing several of these problems. In this review, a factorization machine with quantum annealing or with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA) algorithm to realize fast computations of BBO using Ising machines (IMs) is discussed. The FMQA algorithm uses a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model for BBO. The FM model can be directly transformed into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model that can be solved using IMs. This makes it possible to optimize the acquisition function in BBO, which is a difficult task using conventional methods without IMs. Consequently, it has the advantage of handling large BBO problems. To be able to perform BBO with the FMQA algorithm immediately, we introduce the FMQA algorithm along with Python packages to run it. In addition, we review examples of applications of the FMQA algorithm in various fields, including physics, chemistry, materials science, and social sciences. These successful examples include binary and integer optimization problems, as well as more general optimization problems involving graphs, networks, and strings, using a binary variational autoencoder. We believe that BBO using the FMQA algorithm will become a key technology in IMs including quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Continuous sample space reducing stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model for sample space reducing (SSR) stochastic process, where the dynamical variable denoting the size of the state space is continuous. In general, one can view the model as a multiplicative stochastic process, with a constraint that the size of the state space cannot be smaller than a visibility parameter $\epsilon$. We study the survival time statistics that reveal a subtle difference from the discrete version of the process. A straightforward generalization can explain the noisy SSR process, characterized by a tunable parameter $\lambda \in [0, 1]$. We also examine the statistics of the size of the state space that follows a power-law distributed probability $\mathbb{P}_{\epsilon}(z\le \epsilon) \sim z^{-\alpha}$, with a nontrivial value of the exponent as a function of the tunable parameter $\alpha = 1+\lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for response theory in diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations, based on the notion of the Dissipation Function. Using the analytically solvable Brownian oscillator model, we derive exact response formulae for both overdamped and underdamped dynamics of harmonically bound Brownian particles. We also demonstrate that for certain observables and under suitable time scaling, the operations of model reduction and response formula extraction commute.</description>

      <title>Oscillator Potts machines: An overdamped Langevin model for low-energy sampling of the standard Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Potts model is a fundamental model in statistical physics that generalizes the Ising model. Although Ising machines, as Langevin models, have been widely studied for sampling the Ising model, studies of Langevin models for sampling the standard Potts model are still lacking. In this work, we present a compact and physically realizable Langevin model that serves as a sampler for sampling the low-energy spin configurations of the standard Potts model.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of ionic currents in dilute electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the exponentially rare fluctuations of the ionic current for a dilute electrolyte by means of macroscopic fluctuation theory. We consider the fluctuating hydrodynamics of a fluid electrolyte described by a stochastic Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equations that dictate the optimal concentration profiles of ions conditioned on exhibiting a given current, whose form determines the likelihood of that current in the long-time limit. For a symmetric electrolyte under small applied voltages, number density fluctuations are small, and ionic current fluctuations are Gaussian with a variance determined by the Nernst-Einstein conductivity. Under large applied potentials, where number densities vary, the ionic current distribution is generically non-Gaussian. Its structure is constrained thermodynamically by Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry and the thermodynamic uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Theory of Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic behavior of two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. We show that, in the absence of fluctuations, such systems generically form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity of the entire system rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency b. Fluctuations about this state belong to the universality class of (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order in the hydrodynamic limit. We then show that, in the limit of weak chirality, the hydrodynamics of a system with reasonable size is expected to governed by the linear regime of the KPZ equation, exhibiting quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for the velocity and number density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entanged approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and benchmarking quantum devices. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. We show that those resources such quantum states can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega\left(\log (t/\epsilon)\right)$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, those resources do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$ in the system. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states. To this end, we develop an algorithm that transforms $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones through a sequence of multi-controlled gates, without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit is $O\left(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of shallow quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in various quantum information processing tasks. As a concrete example for demonstrating utility of our algorithm, we propose classical shadow tomography using an $O(1)$-entangled estimator, which can achieve shorter runtime compared to conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>SETOL: A Semi-Empirical Theory of (Deep) Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry. The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning, including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models, we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.</description>

      <title>Qubit encodings for lattices of dipolar planar rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near term quantum devices have recently garnered significant interest as promising candidates for investigating difficult-to-probe regimes in many-body physics. To this end, various qubit encoding schemes targeting second quantized Hamiltonians have been proposed and optimized. In this work, we investigate two qubit representations of the planar rotor lattice Hamiltonian. The first representation is realized by decomposing the rotor Hamiltonian projectors in binary and mapping them to spin-1/2 projectors. The second approach relies on embedding the planar rotor lattice Hilbert space in a larger space and recovering the relevant qubit encoded system as a quotient space projecting down to the physical degrees of freedom. This is typically called the unary mapping and is used for bosonic systems. We establish the veracity of the two encoding approaches using sparse diagonalization on small chains and discuss quantum phase estimation resource requirements to simulate small planar rotor lattices on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Memory and Hysteresis from Quantum Transitions: Theory and Experiments on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing leverages quantum tunneling for non-local searches, thereby minimizing memory effects that typically arise from metastabilities. Nonetheless, recent work has demonstrated robust hysteresis in large-scale transverse-field Ising systems implemented on D-Wave's analog quantum hardware. The quantum nature of these intriguing results remains to be understood at a deeper level. Here, we present a conceptual framework that explains the observed behavior by combining two-level Landau-Zener transitions via a first-order piecewise-constant propagator with semiclassical domain-wall kinetics. We test this approach experimentally on a quantum annealer, where we observe clear coercivity even in one-dimensional rings with periodic boundary conditions comprising up to 4,906 qubits-regimes where classical hysteresis is forbidden, but quantum hysteresis is not. Our framework reproduces the measured kink densities, hysteresis loop shapes, and longitudinal sweep-rate scaling trends observed in data from three different D-Wave quantum annealers. In particular, it captures striking non-monotonic features and transiently negative susceptibilities, identifying them as genuine quantum memory effects. These results establish programmable quantum annealers as powerful testbeds for exploring memory-endowed non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Magnetization Temperature Dependence in Ferrimagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spintronics and fundamental physical research have brought increased attention to the rare-earth-based magnetically ordered materials. One of the important properties of these materials is the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization $M(T)$. Recently, a successful framework was proposed for the theoretical description of M(T) across the entire temperature range from zero to the Curie temperature in simple cubic ferromagnetics, EuO and EuS. We extend this approach to compute and analyze $M(T)$ for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnetics such as Yttrium Iron Garnet $Y_3Fe_5 O_{12}$. We analyzed and generalized for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnetics two well-known approximations describing $M(T)$. The first approach is the Bloch-3/2 law, which describes the suppression of $M(T)$ due to spin-wave excitation, and is valid in the low-temperature limit $T &lt;&lt; T_c$. The second one is Weiss's mean-field approximation, which provides a reasonable description of $M(T)$ near $T_c$. Using a single tuning parameter, we combine these two approaches to describe $M(T)$ for any $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$. The theoretical result for $M(T)$ aligns well with our measurements and the previously available experimental data across the entire temperature range. We also demonstrate that experimental and theoretical dependences $M(T)$ follow the mean-field prediction $\sqrt{T_c - T }$ for almost all temperatures.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Dynamics in Atomic-Molecular Bose Condensates in the Presence of Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of atomic and molecular bosons weakly coupled via Feshbach detuning in the presence of Gaussian white noise. The time-evolution of the population imbalance between the two species, as well as the coherence of the system are analyzed using a Bloch sphere model. We observe that the system exhibits relaxation of the Bloch vector components towards a stable equilibrium. In the population imbalance dynamics, the relaxation rates predicted by the Bogoliubov Born Green Kirkwood Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy are found to be smaller than those calculated with a simple the mean field approximation. As for the coherence dynamics, the inclusion of correlations and fluctuations in the system can either increase or decrease the relaxation time, depending on the initial conditions. We attribute the increase in the relaxation time to the emergence of a structured noise, and the subsequent suppression of certain dephasing channels. We also study the impact of correlations and fluctuations on time-averaged quantities like the drift speed, the fringe visibility, the phase entanglement etc., and find the results to be in perfect agreement with the properties of the relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Thermalization of a Localized Chain Interacting with an Ergodic Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of many-body localized (MBL) phases intrinsically links spectral properties with eigenstate characteristics: localized systems exhibit Poisson level statistics and area-law entanglement entropy, while ergodic systems display volume-law entanglement and follow random matrix theory predictions, including level repulsion. Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the periodic Fredkin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fredkin chain is a spin-$1/2$ model with interaction of three nearest neighbors. In the case of periodic boundary conditions the ground state is degenerated and can be described in terms of equivalence classes of the Dyck paths. We introduce two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at the ground states. These operators generate the $B$- or $C$-type Lie algebras, depending on whether the number of sites $N$ is odd or even, respectively, with rank $n=\lceil N/2\rceil$. The third component of total spin operator can be represented as a sum of the Cartan subalgebra elements and some central element. In the $C$-type Lie algebra case (even number of sites) this representation coincides with a similar formula previously conjectured for spin-$1$ operators, in the context of periodic Motzkin chain.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic properties of a binary, symmetric mixture of ultrasoft particles in the vicinity of criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the static and the dynamic properties of an binary, equimolar, size-symmetric mixture of ultrasoft particles in the vicinity of the critical point of the system. Based on the generalized exponential potential (GEM) of order four for the particle interaction and using extensive molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble we investigate the above mentioned properties for various scenarios: we consider several super- and subcritical states, we expose the system to rapid quenches and to external shearing forces. Based on an accurate determination of the phase diagram and of the location of the critical point we study the static structure of the system in terms of particle-based radial distribution functions. As systems of GEM particles are prone to cluster formation we complement these investigations by a detailed analysis of the composition of the clusters and of their spatial correlations for the different scenarios introduced above. Furthermore we analyse the temperature dependence of the diffusivity of the particles and of the shear viscosity of the system. All these data provide a detailed and profound insight into the properties of the system under phase separation conditions and near criticality.</description>

Abstract: The robustness of properties of a statistical physics model to slight perturbations in the exact local interactions of the model is a very relevant philosophical question, considering real-life measurements on which we base some models can only ever reach a finite precision. In this article, we will discuss this topic in a formal mathematical setting, and notably exhibit a family of models for which the low-temperature behaviour is highly non-robust.</description>

      <title>Diffusion as a Signature of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic, non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos. Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the Chirikov standard map.</description>

      <title>Regularizing 3D conformal field theories via anyons on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently introduced ''fuzzy sphere'' method has enabled accurate numerical regularizations of certain three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs). The regularization is provided by the non-commutative geometry of the lowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially gapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor $\nu=1$, while the electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy sphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important question: how finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be? Here, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron fillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the charge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state -- a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied $\nu=1$ case. Remarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the FQH spectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically-accessible system sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the exchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in the charge sector. Our results set the stage for the fuzzy-sphere exploration of conformal critical points between topologically-ordered states.</description>

      <title>Towards Markov-State Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This motivates the notion of "weak Markov order" and provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium systems exchange information in addition to energy. In information thermodynamics, the information flow is characterized by the learning rate, which is not invariant under coordinate transformations. To formalize the property of the learning rate under variable transformations, we introduce a learning rate matrix. This matrix has the learning rates as its diagonal elements and characterizes the changes in the learning rates under linear coordinate transformations. The maximal eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the learning rate matrix gives the maximal information flow under orthogonal transformations. Furthermore, we derive a new trade-off relation between the learning rate and the heat dissipation of a subsystem. Finally, we illustrate the results using analytically solvable yet experimentally feasible models.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near equilibrium, the symmetric part of the time-integrated steady-state covariance, i.e., the time integral of correlation functions, is governed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, while the antisymmetric part vanishes due to Onsager reciprocity. Far from equilibrium, where these principles no longer apply, we develop a unified formalism for both symmetric and antisymmetric components of integrated covariances. We derive exact, computationally tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds for these covariances in terms of entropy production, dynamical activity, and cycle affinities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many have speculated whether nonequilibrium systems obey principles of maximum or minimum entropy production. In this work, we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive the condition for the minimum entropy production state (MEPS) for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), even far from equilibrium. We show that real nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) generally violate both the MINEP and MAXEP principles. However, through numerical sampling of large interconnected CTMCs, we find that as system size increases, the steady-state entropy production tends to converge toward the minimum. This suggests that large nonequilibrium systems may self-organize to make efficient use of thermodynamic resources, offering a nuanced perspective on the longstanding debate between MAXEP and MINEP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between chiral active particles -- self-propelling and self-rotating entities -- is crucial for uncovering how chiral active matter self-organizes into dynamic structures. Although fluctuation-induced forces in nonequilibrium active systems can drive structure formation, the role of chirality remains largely unexplored. We investigate effective fluctuation-induced forces between intruders immersed in chiral active fluids and reveal that the impact of chirality depends sensitively on particle shape. For circular particles, increasing the self-rotation to self-propulsion ratio suppresses the interaction, reflecting a transition from rotating flocks to localized spinners. Contrarily, a striking collective behavior emerges for rodlike particles: vortices spontaneously form around the intruders, most pronounced at an optimal chiral angle where the mean curvature of particle trajectories matches the intruder boundary curvature, maximizing the effective force. We map the attractive and repulsive force regimes across chirality, propulsion, and intruder separation, offering new insights and principles for designing and controlling self-assembled active systems.</description>

Abstract: Gradient descent is commonly used to find minima in rough landscapes, particularly in recent machine learning applications. However, a theoretical understanding of why good solutions are found remains elusive, especially in strongly non-convex and high-dimensional settings. Here, we focus on the phase retrieval problem as a typical example, which has received a lot of attention recently in theoretical machine learning. We analyze the Hessian during gradient descent, identify a dynamical transition in its spectral properties, and relate it to the ability of escaping rough regions in the loss landscape. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large enough, an informative negative direction exists in the Hessian at the beginning of the descent, i.e in the initial condition. While descending, a BBP transition in the spectrum takes place in finite time: the direction is lost, and the dynamics is trapped in a rugged region filled with marginally stable bad minima. Surprisingly, for finite system sizes, this window of negative curvature allows the system to recover the signal well before the theoretical SNR found for infinite sizes, emphasizing the central role of initialization and early-time dynamics for efficiently navigating rough landscapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a three-dimensional system that exhibits long-range entanglement at sufficiently small but nonzero temperature--it therefore constitutes a quantum topological order at finite temperature. The model of interest is known as the fermionic toric code, a variant of the usual 3D toric code, which admits emergent fermionic point-like excitations. The fermionic toric code, importantly, possesses an anomalous 2-form symmetry, associated with the space-like Wilson loops of the fermionic excitations. We argue that it is this symmetry that imbues low-temperature thermal states with a novel topological order and long-range entanglement. Based on the current classification of three-dimensional topological orders, we expect that the low-temperature thermal states of the fermionic toric code belong to an equilibrium phase of matter that only exists at nonzero temperatures. We conjecture that further examples of topological orders at nonzero temperatures are given by discrete gauge theories with anomalous 2-form symmetries. Our work therefore opens the door to studying quantum topological order at nonzero temperature in physically realistic dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The weight space of an artificial neural network can be systematically explored using tools from statistical mechanics. We employ a combination of a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which performs long exploration steps, a ratchet-based algorithm to investigate connectivity paths, and coupled replica models simulations to study subdominant flat regions. Our analysis focuses on one hidden layer networks and spans a range of energy levels and constrained density regimes. Near the interpolation threshold, the low-energy manifold shows a spiky topology. In the overparameterized regime, however, the low-energy manifold becomes entirely flat, forming an extended complex structure that is easy to sample. These numerical results are supported by an analytical study of the training error landscape, and we show numerically that the qualitative features of the loss landscape are robust across different data structures.
  Our study aims to provide new methodological insights for developing scalable methods for large networks.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [5] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We moreover argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series--Sinai states [23] at low temperature.</description>

Abstract: While quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on correlated spin systems, the important phenomenology of magnetic memory and hysteresis remain unexplored on hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling. Here, we present the first general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis on programmable quantum annealers, and implement it on three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealers, using up to thousands of spins, for both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models, and across different graph topologies. We observe hysteresis loops whose area depends non-monotonically on quantum fluctuations, exhibiting both expected and unexpected features, such as disorder-induced steps and non-monotonicities. Our work establishes quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena, thereby broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</description>
