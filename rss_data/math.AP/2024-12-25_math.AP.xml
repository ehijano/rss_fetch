      <title>Quantitative properties of the Hardy-type mean field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Hardy-type mean field equation \[ \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} { - \Delta u-\frac{1}{(1-|x|^2)^2} u = \lambda e^u}, &amp; {\rm in} \ \ B_1, {\ \ \ \ u = 0,} &amp;\ {\rm on}\ \partial B_1, \end{array}} \right. \] \[\] where $\lambda&gt;0$ is small and $B_1$ is the standard unit disc of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Applying the moving plane method of hyperbolic space and the accurate expansion of heat kernel on hyperbolic space, we establish the radial symmetry and Brezis-Merle lemma for solutions of Hardy-type mean field equation. Meanwhile, we also derive the quantitative results for solutions of Hardy-type mean field equation, which improves significantly the compactness results for classical mean-field equation obtained by Brezis-Merle and Li-Shafrir. Furthermore, applying the local Pohozaev identity from scaling, blow-up analysis and a contradiction argument, we prove that the solutions are unique when $\lambda$ is sufficiently close to 0.</description>

      <title>Small-scale mass estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact $C^{2}$ manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be an $n$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold with $C^2$ boundary, and consider $L^2$-normalized eigenfunctions $ - \Delta \phi_{\lambda} = \lambda^2 \phi_\lambda$ with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions .
  In this note, we extend well-known interior nonconcentration bounds up to the boundary. Specifically, in Theorem \ref{thm1} using purely stationary, local methods, we prove that for such $\Omega$, it follows that for {\em any} $x_0 \in \overline{\Omega}$ (including boundary points) and for all $\mu \geq h,$ \begin{equation} \label{nonconbdy}
  \| \phi_\lambda \|_{B(x_0,\mu)\cap \Omega}^2 = O(\mu). \end{equation}
  In Theorem \ref{thm2} we extend a result of Sogge \cite{So} to manifolds with smooth boundary and show that
  \begin{equation} \label{SUPBD}
  \| \phi_\lambda \|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{n}{2}} \cdot \sup_{x \in \Omega} \| \phi_{\lambda} \|_{L^2( B(x,\lambda^{-1}) \cap \Omega )}. \end{equation}
  The sharp sup bounds $\| \phi_{\lambda} \|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} = O(\lambda^{\frac{n-1}{2}})$ first proved by Grieser in \cite{Gr} are then an immediate consequence of Theorems \ref{thm1} and \ref{thm2}.</description>

      <title>The symbol of the normal operator for the d-plane transform on the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We directly compute the symbol of the normal operator for the d-plane transform on the Euclidean space. We show that this symbol is the product of the symbol of the power of the Laplacian of order -d/2 and a constant given by an invariant integral over excess-dimensional spaces. This leads to an alternative derivation of the filtered backprojection formula for the d-plane transform.</description>

      <title>Regularity and stability in a strongly degenerate nonlinear diffusion and haptotaxis model of cancer invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mathematical model of cancer cell invasion of the extracellular matrix (ECM), comprising a strongly degenerate parabolic partial differential equation for the cell volume fraction, coupled with an ordinary differential equation for the ECM volume fraction. The model captures the intricate link between the dynamics of invading cancer cells and the surrounding ECM. First, migrating cells undergo haptotaxis, i.e., movement up ECM density gradients. Secondly, cancer cells degrade the ECM fibers by means of membrane-bound proteases. Finally, their migration speed is modulated by the ECM pore sizes, resulting in the saturation or even interruption of cell motility both at high and low ECM densities. The inclusion of the physical limits of cell migration results in two regimes of degeneracy of the nonlinear diffusion and haptotaxis terms. We devise specific estimates that are compatible with the strong degeneracy of the equation, focusing on the vacuum present at low ECM densities. Based on these regularity results, and associated local compactness, we prove stability of weak solutions with respect to perturbations on bounded initial data.</description>

      <title>Removable singularities for Lipschitz fractional caloric functions in time varying domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study removable singularities for regular $(1,\frac{1}{2s})$-Lipschitz solutions of the $s$-fractional heat equation for $1/2&lt;s&lt;1$. To do so, we define a Lipschitz fractional caloric capacity and study its metric and geometric properties, such as its critical dimension in an $s$-parabolic sense or the $L^2$-boundedness of a pair of singular integral operators, whose kernels will be the gradient of the fundamental solution of the fractional heat equation and its conjugate.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcation Curve for Fourth-Order MEMS/NEMS Models with Clamped Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order equations with doubly clamped boundary conditions are established. The results extend a theorem of P. Korman (2004) by allowing the presence of a singularity in the nonlinearity. The paper also provides a global a priori bound for $C^3$-norm of positive solutions, which is optimal in terms of regularity. Examples arising in MEMS/NEMS models are presented to illustrate applications of the main results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the local Calder\'on-Zygmund type estimate for the singular parabolic double-phase system. The proof covers the counterpart $p&lt;2$ of the result in [23]. Phase analysis is employed to determine an appropriate intrinsic geometry for each phase. Comparison estimates and scaling invariant properties for each intrinsic geometry are the main techniques to obtain the main estimate.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions for parabolic equations and systems: universal existence, uniqueness, representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal, conceptually simple and systematic method to prove well-posedness to Cauchy problems for weak solutions of parabolic equations with non-smooth, time-dependent, elliptic part having a variational definition. Our classes of weak solutions are taken with minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution which seems new in this generality: it is shown to always coincide with the associated evolution family for the initial value problem with zero source and it yields representation of all weak solutions. Our strategy is a variational approach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or regularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results which yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated Lions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms. We illustrate our results with three concrete applications : second order uniformly elliptic part with Dirichlet boundary condition on domains, integro-differential elliptic part, and second order degenerate elliptic part.</description>

      <title>New applications of Hadamard-in-the-mean inequalities to incompressible variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{D}(u)$ be the Dirichlet energy of a map $u$ belonging to the Sobolev space $H^1_{u_0}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^2)$ and let $A$ be a subclass of $H^1_{u_0}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^2)$ whose members are subject to the constraint $\det \nabla u = g$ a.e. for a given $g$, together with some boundary data $u_0$. We develop a technique that, when applicable, enables us to characterize the global minimizer of $\mathbb{D}(u)$ in $A$ as the unique global minimizer of the associated functional $F(u):=\mathbb{D}(u)+ \int_{\Omega} f(x) \, \det \nabla u(x) \, dx$ in the free class $H^1_{u_0}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^2)$. A key ingredient is the mean coercivity of $F(\varphi)$ on $H^1_0(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^2)$, which condition holds provided the `pressure' $f \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ is `tuned' according to the procedure set out in \cite{BKV23}. The explicit examples to which our technique applies can be interpreted as solving the sort of constrained minimization problem that typically arises in incompressible nonlinear elasticity theory.</description>

      <title>On the fractional approach to quadratic nonlinear parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general coupled system of parabolic equations with quadratic nonlinear terms and diffusion terms defined by fractional powers of the Laplacian operator. We develop a method to establish the rigorous convergence of the fractional diffusion case to the classical diffusion case in the strong topology of Sobolev spaces, with explicit convergence rates that reveal some unexpected phenomena.
  These results apply to several relevant real-world models included in the general system, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, the Magneto-hydrodynamics equations, the Boussinesq system, and the Keller-Segel system. For these specific models, this fractional approach is further motivated by previous numerical and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Existence of the planar stationary flow in the presence of interior sources and sinks in an exterior domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider the solvability of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in an exterior unit disk. On the boundary of the disk, the tangential velocity is subject to the perturbation of a rotation, and the normal velocity is subject to the perturbation of an interior sources or sinks. At infinity, the flow stays at rest. We will construct a solution to such problem, whose principal part admits a critical decay $O(|x|^{-1})$. The result is related to an open problem raised by V. I. Yudovich in [{\it Eleven great problems of mathematical hydrodynamics}, Mosc. Math. J. 3 (2003), no. 2, 711--737], where Problem 2b states that: {\em Prove or disprove the global existence of stationary and periodic flows of a viscous incompressible fluid in the presence of interior sources and sinks.} Our result partially gives a positive answer to this open in the exterior disk for the case when the interior source or sink is a perturbation of the constant state.</description>

      <title>Does Yakhot's growth law for turbulent burning velocity hold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using formal renormalization theory, Yakhot derived in ([28], 1988) an $O\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{\log A}}\right)$ growth law of the turbulent flame speed with respect to large flow intensity $A$ based on the inviscid G-equation. Although this growth law is widely cited in combustion literature, there has been no rigorous mathematical discussion to date about its validity. As a first step towards unveiling the mystery, we prove that there is no intermediate growth law between $O\left(\frac{A}{\log A}\right)$ and $O(A)$ for two dimensional incompressible Lipschitz continuous periodic flows with bounded swirl sizes. In particular, we do not assume the non-degeneracy of critical points. Additionally, other examples of flows with lower regularity, Lagrangian chaos, and related phenomena are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of non-overlapping models with a weighted infinite delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of this article is cell motility modeling. Approximating cells as rigid spheres we take into account for both non-penetration and adhesions forces. Adhesions are modeled as a memory-like microscopic elastic forces. This leads to a delayed and constrained vector valued system of equations. We prove that the solution of these equations converges when {\epsilon}, the linkages turnover parameter, tends to zero to the a constrained model with friction. We discretize the problem and penalize the constraints to get an uncon?strained minimization problem. The well-posedness of the constrained problem is obtained by letting the penalty parameter to tend to zero. Energy estimates `a la De Giorgi are derived accounting for delay. Thanks to these estimates and the convexity of the constraints, we obtain compactness uniformly with respect to the discretisation step and {\epsilon}, this is the mathematically involved part of the article. Considering that the characteristic bonds lifetime goes to zero, we recover a friction model comparable to [Venel et al, ESAIM, 2011] but under more realistic assumptions on the external load, this part being also one of the challenging aspects of the work</description>

      <title>Adapting Priority Riemann Solver for GSOM on road networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extension of the Generic Second Order Models (GSOM) for traffic flow on road networks. We define a Riemann solver at the junction based on a priority rule and provide an iterative algorithm to construct solutions at junctions with n incoming and m outgoing roads. The logic underlying our solver is as follows: the flow is maximized while respecting the priority rule, which can be adjusted if the supply of an outgoing road exceeds the demand of a higher-priority incoming road. Approximate solutions for Cauchy problems are constructed using wave-front tracking. We establish bounds on the total variation of waves interacting with the junction and present explicit calculations for junctions with two incoming and two outgoing roads. A key novelty of this work is the detailed analysis of returning waves - waves generated at the junction that return to the junction after interacting along the roads - which, in contrast to first-order models such as LWR, can increase flux variation.</description>

      <title>Late-time tails and mass inflation for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a decay result in the black hole exterior region of spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system arising from compactly supported admissible data. Our result allows for large initial data, and it is the first decay statement for higher order derivatives of the scalar field.
  Solutions to this model generically develop a singularity in the black hole interior. Indeed, Luk--Oh (arxiv:1702.05715, arxiv:1702.05716) identify a generic class of initial data that produces $C^2$-future-inextendible solutions. However, they leave open the question of mass inflation: does the Hawking mass become identically infinite at the Cauchy horizon? By work of Luk--Oh--Shlapentokh-Rothman (arxiv:2201.12294), our decay result implies mass inflation for sufficiently regular solutions in the generic class considered by Luk--Oh (arxiv:1702.05715, arxiv:1702.05716).
  Together with the methods and results of Luk--Oh (arXiv:2404.02220), our estimates imply a late-time tails result for the scalar field. This result provides another proof of generic mass inflation, through a result of Dafermos (arXiv:arch-ive/0307013). Another application of our late-time tails result, due to Van de Moortel, is the global construction of two-ended black holes that contain null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Weak error estimates of Galerkin approximations for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by additive trace-class noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish weak convergence rates for spectral Galerkin approximations of the stochastic viscous Burgers equation driven by additive trace-class noise. Our results complement the known results regarding strong convergence; we obtain essential weak convergence rate 2. As expected, this is twice the known strong rate. The main ingredients of the proof are novel regularity results on the solutions of the associated Kolmogorov equations.</description>

      <title>On a generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equation on closed almost K\"ahler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation on closed almost K\"ahler surfaces, where the equation depends only on the underlying almost K\"ahler structure. As an application, we prove Donaldson's conjecture for tamed almost complex 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>A positivity preserving second-order scheme for multi-dimensional system of non-local conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-local systems of conservation laws play a crucial role in modeling flow mechanisms across various scenarios. The well-posedness of such problems is typically established by demonstrating the convergence of robust first-order schemes. However, achieving more accurate solutions necessitates the development of higher-order schemes. In this article, we present a fully discrete, second-order scheme for a general class of non-local conservation law systems in multiple spatial dimensions. The method employs a MUSCL-type spatial reconstruction coupled with Runge-Kutta time integration. The proposed scheme is proven to preserve positivity in all the unknowns and exhibits L-infinity stability. Numerical experiments conducted on both the non-local scalar and system cases illustrate the8 importance of second-order scheme when compared to its first-order counterpart.</description>

      <title>The Riesz basisness of the eigenfunctions and eigenvectors connected to the stability problem of a fluid-conveying tube with boundary control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the stability problem for a stretched tube conveying fluid with boundary control. The abstract spectral problem concerns operator pencils of the forms \begin{equation*} \mathcal{M}\left(\lambda\right)=\lambda^2G+\lambda D+C\quad\text{and}\quad\mathcal{P}\left(\lambda\right)=\lambda I-T \end{equation*} taking values in different Hilbert product spaces. Thorough analysis is made of the location and asymptotics of eigenvalues in the complex plane and Riesz basisness of the corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenvectors. Well-posedness of the closed-loop system represented by the initial-value problem for the abstract equation \begin{equation*} \dot{{x}}\left(t\right)=Tx\left(t\right) \end{equation*} is established in the framework of semigroups as well as expansions of the solutions in terms of eigenvectors and stability of the closed-loop system operator $T$. For the parameters of the problem we give regions, larger than those in the literature, in which a stretched tube with flow, simply supported at one end, with a boundary controller applied at the other end, can be made exponentially stable.</description>

      <title>Massive wave propagation near null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study, fully microlocally, the propagation of massive waves on the octagonal compactification \[\mathbb{O}=[\overline{\mathbb{R}^{1,d}};\mathscr{I};1/2]\] of asymptotically Minkowski spacetime, which allows a detailed analysis both at timelike and spacelike infinity (as previously investigated using Parenti-Shubin-Melrose's sc-calculus) and, more novelly, at null infinity, denoted $\mathscr{I}$. The analysis is closely related to Hintz-Vasy's recent analysis of massless wave propagation at null infinity using the ``e,b-calculus'' on $\mathbb{O}$. We prove several elementary corollaries regarding the Klein-Gordon IVP. Our main technical tool is a fully symbolic pseudodifferential calculus, $\Psi_{\mathrm{de,sc}}(\mathbb{O})$, the ``de,sc-calculus'' on $\mathbb{O}$. The `de' refers to the structure (``double edge'') of the calculus at null infinity, and the `sc' refers to the structure (``scattering'') at the other boundary faces. We relate this structure to the hyperbolic coordinates used in other studies of the Klein-Gordon equation. Unlike hyperbolic coordinates, the de,sc-boundary fibration structure is Poincar\'e invariant.</description>

      <title>On semipositone problems over $\mathbb{R}^N$ for the fractional $p$-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $N \ge 1, s\in (0,1)$, and $p \in (1, N/s)$ we find a positive solution to the following class of semipositone problems associated with the fractional $p$-Laplace operator: \begin{equation}\tag{SP}
  (-\Delta)_{p}^{s}u = g(x)f_a(u) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation} where $g \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is a positive function, $a&gt;0$ is a parameter and $f_a \in \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R})$ is defined as $f_a(t) = f(t)-a$ for $t \ge 0$, $f_a(t) = -a(t+1)$ for $t \in [-1, 0]$, and $f_a(t) = 0$ for $t \le -1$, where $f \in \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^+)$ satisfies $f(0)=0$ with subcritical and Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type growth. Depending on the range of $a$, we obtain the existence of a mountain pass solution to (SP) in $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Then, we prove mountain pass solutions are uniformly bounded with respect to $a$, over $L^r(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for every $r \in [Np/N-sp, \infty]$. In addition, if $p&gt;2N/N+2s$, we establish that (SP) admits a non-negative mountain pass solution for each $a$ near zero. Finally, under the assumption $g(x) \leq B/|x|^{\beta(p-1)+sp}$ for $B&gt;0, x \neq 0$, and $ \beta \in (N-sp/p-1, N/p-1)$, we derive an explicit positive radial subsolution to (SP) and show that the non-negative solution is positive a.e. in $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>
