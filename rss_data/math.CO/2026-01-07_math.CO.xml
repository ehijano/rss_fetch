      <title>Lee-Yang phenomena in edge-coloured graph counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the accumulation of zeros of a polynomial arising from the enumeration of edge-coloured graphs along certain limit curves. The polynomial is a variant of an edge-chromatic polynomial, which specialises to the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model on a random regular graph. We call this accumulation behaviour a Lee-Yang phenomenon in analogy with the Lee-Yang theorem. The limiting loci are semialgebraic and arise from anti-Stokes curves of an exponential integral.</description>

      <title>Tree metrics and log-concavity for matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a set function $\nu$ satisfies the gross substitutes property if and only if its homogeneous generating polynomial $Z_{q,\nu}$ is a Lorentzian polynomial for all positive $q \le 1$, answering a question of Eur-Huh. We achieve this by giving a rank 1 upper bound for the distance matrix of an ultrametric tree, refining a classical result of Graham-Pollak. This characterization enables us to resolve two open problems that strengthen Mason's log-concavity conjectures for the number of independent sets of a matroid: one posed by Giansiracusa-Rinc\'on-Schleis-Ulirsch for valuated matroids, and another posed by Pak for ordinary matroids.</description>

      <title>A modern perspective on Tutte's homotopy theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin with a review of Tutte's homotopy theory, which concerns the structure of certain graph associated to a matroid (together with some extra data). Concretely, Tutte's path theorem asserts that this graph is connected, and his homotopy theorem asserts that every cycle in the graph is a composition of ''elementary cycles'', which come in four different flavors. We present an extended version of the homotopy theorem, in which we give a more refined classification of the different types of elementary cycles. We explain in detail how the path theorem allows one to prove that the foundation of a matroid (in the sense of Baker--Lorscheid) is generated by universal cross-ratios, and how the extended homotopy theorem allows one to classify all algebraic relations between universal cross-ratios. The resulting ''fundamental presentation'' of the foundation was previously established in [Baker--Lorscheid], but the argument here is more self-contained. We then recall a few applications of the fundamental presentation to the representation theory of matroids. Finally, in the most novel but also the most speculative part of the paper, we discuss what a ''higher Tutte homotopy theorem'' might look like, and we present some preliminary computations along these lines.</description>

      <title>Branching $k$-path vertex cover of forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a set $P$ to be a branching $k$-path vertex cover of an undirected forest $F$ if all leaves and isolated vertices (vertices of degree at most $1$) of $F$ belong to $P$ and every path on $k$ vertices (of length $k-1$) contains either a branching vertex (a vertex of degree at least $3$) or a vertex belonging to $P$. We define the branching $k$-path vertex cover number of an undirected forest $F$, denoted by $\psi_b(F,k)$, to be the number of vertices in the smallest branching $k$-path vertex cover of $F$. These notions for a rooted directed forest are defined similarly, with natural adjustments. We prove the lower bound $\psi_b(F,k) \geq \frac{n+3k-1}{2k}$ for undirected forests, the lower bound $\psi_b(F,k) \geq \frac{n+k}{2k}$ for rooted directed forests, and that both of them are tight.</description>

      <title>Affirmative Results on a Conjecture on the Column Space of the Adjacency Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Akbari-Cameron-Khosrovshahi (ACK) conjecture, which appears to be unresolved, states that for any simple graph $G$ with at least one edge, there exists a nonzero {$\{0,1\}$}-vector in the row space of its adjacency matrix that is not a row of the matrix itself. In this talk, we present a unified framework that includes several families and operations of graphs that satisfy the ACK conjecture. Using these fundamental results, we introduce new graph constructions and demonstrate, through graph structural and linear algebraic arguments, that these constructions adhere to the conjecture. Further, we show that certain graph operations preserve the ACK property. These results collectively expand the known classes of graphs satisfying the conjecture and provide insight into its structural invariance under composition and extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A constructive method is given for obtaining cospectral vertices in undirected graphs, along with an operation that preserves this construction. We prove that the construction yields cospectral vertices, as well as strongly cospectral vertices under additional conditions. Furthermore, we generalize cospectral vertices to the case of the graph Laplacian and provide an analogous construction.</description>

      <title>Characteristic quasi-polynomials of truncated arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an (affine) integral arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, the reduction of $\mathcal{A}$ modulo an arbitrary positive integer $q$ naturally yields an arrangement $\mathcal{A}_q$ in $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$. Our primary objective is to study the combinatorial aspects of the restriction $\mathcal{A}^{(B,\bm b)}$ to the solution space of $B\bm x=\bm b$, and its reduction $\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\bm b)}$ modulo $q$. This work generalizes the earlier results of Kamiya, Takemura and Terao, as well as Chen and Wang.
  The purpose of this paper is threefold as follows. Firstly, we derive an explicit counting formula for the cardinality of the complement $M\big(\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\bm b)}\big)$ of $\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\bm b)}$; and prove that for all positive integers $q&gt;q_0$, this cardinality coincides with a quasi-polynomial $\chi^{\text{quasi}}\big(\mathcal{A}^{(B,\bm b)},q\big)$ in $q$ with a period $\rho_C$. Secondly, we weaken Chen and Wang's original hypothesis $a \mid b$ to a strictly more general condition $\gcd(a,\rho_C)\mid \gcd(b,\rho_C)$, and introduce the concept of combinatorial equivalence for positive integers. Within this framework, we establish three unified comparison relations: between the unsigned coefficients of $\chi^{\text{quasi}}\big(\mathcal{A}^{(B,\bm b)},a\big)$ and $\chi^{\text{quasi}}\big(\mathcal{A}^{(B,\bm b)},b\big)$; between the unsigned coefficients of distinct constituents of $\chi^{\text{quasi}}\big(\mathcal{A}^{(B,\bm b)},q\big)$; and between the cardinalities of $M\big(\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\bm b)}\big)$ and $M\big(\mathcal{A}_{pq}^{(B,\bm b)}\big)$. Thirdly, using our method, we revisit the enumerative aspects of group colorings and nowhere-zero nonhomogeneous form flows from the early work of Forge, Zaslavsky and Kochol.</description>

      <title>The left-to-right minima basis of the group algebra of the symmetric group (updated version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new basis of the group algebra of the symmetric group, built using the left-to-right minima sets of permutations. We show that on this basis, the descent algebra acts by triangular operators, thus making it an analogue of a cellular basis. The proof involves Dynkin elements (nested commutators) of the free algebra and their interactions with the $\mathbf B$-basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boja\'nczyk, Pilipczuk, and Grohe [LICS '18] proved that for graphs of bounded linear clique-width, clique-decompositions of bounded width can be produced by a CMSO transduction. We show that in the case of tournaments, a first-order transduction suffices. This implies that the logics CMSO and existential MSO are equivalent over bounded linear clique-width tournaments.</description>

      <title>A proof of Xin-Zhang's tridiagonal determinant conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm a recent conjecture by Xin and Zhang, which establishes a simple product formula for the characteristic polynomial of an $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ tridiagonal matrix $C$. This characteristic polynomial arises from a recurrence relation that enumerates $n \times n$ nonnegative integer matrices with all row and column sums equal to $t$, also called the Ehrhart polynomial of the $n$th Birkhoff polytope. The proof relies on an unexpected observation: shifting $C$ by a scalar multiple of the identity matrix yields a matrix similar to a lower triangular matrix. In triangular form, the characteristic polynomial reduces to the product of the diagonal entries, leading to the desired closed-form expression. Moreover, we extend this method to broader families of tridiagonal matrices. This provides a new approach for deriving exact enumeration formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine an analogue of the recently solved spectrum conjecture by Fujita in the setting of Fine polyhedral adjunction theory. We present computational results for lower-dimensional polytopes, which lead to a complete classification of the highest numbers of this Fine spectrum in any dimension. Moreover, we present a classification of the Fine spectrum in dimensions one, two and (almost) three, while providing a framework for general classification results in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Valuations on polyhedra and topological arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a classical theme of (general or translation invariant) valuations on convex polyhedra. Our setting generalizes the classical one, in a ``dual'' direction to previously considered generalizations: while previous research was mostly concerned with variations of ground fields/rings, over which the vertices of polytopes are defined, we consider more general collections of defining hyperplanes. No algebraic structures are imposed on these collections. This setting allows us to uncover a close relationship between scissors congruence problems on the one hand and finite hyperplane arrangements on the other hand: there are many parallel results in these fields, for which the parallelism seems to have gone unnoticed. In particular, certain properties of the Varchenko--Gelfand algebras for arrangements translate to properties of polytope rings or valuations. Studying these properties is possible in a general topological setting, that is, in the context of the so-called topological arrangements, where hyperplanes do not have to be straight and may even have nontrivial topology.</description>

Abstract: We show that, under certain constraints, the Stanley-Reisner ring of an infinite simplicial complex is Cohen-Macaulay in the sense of ideals and weak Bourbaki unmixed. We apply this result to prove the wanted claim -- that initial complexes of matrix Schubert varieties corresponding to infinite permutations in $S_{\infty}$ with respect to an antidiagonal term order are Cohen-Macaulay (in the same sense), giving rise to new examples of non-Noetherian Cohen-Macaulay rings.</description>

      <title>Adapting Polyhedral Dominance Cones to Ordinal Preference Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial optimization, ordinal costs can be used to model the quality of elements whenever numerical values are not available. When considering, for example, routing problems for cyclists, the safety of a street can be ranked in ordered categories like safe (separate bike lane), medium safe (street with a bike lane) and unsafe (street without a bike lane). However, ordinal optimization may suggest unrealistic solutions with huge detours to avoid unsafe street segments. In this paper, we investigate how partial preference information regarding the relative quality of the ordinal categories can be used to improve the relevance of the computed solutions. By introducing preference weights which describe how much better a category is at least or at most, compared to the subsequent category, we enlarge the ordinal dominance cone. This leads to a smaller set of alternatives, i. e., of ordinally efficient solutions. We show that the corresponding weighted ordinal ordering cone is a polyhedral cone and provide descriptions via its extreme rays and via its facets. The latter implies a linear transformation to an associated multi-objective optimization problem. This paves the way for the application of standard multi-objective solution approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of the weighted ordinal ordering cone by investigating a safest path problem with different preference weights. Moreover, we investigate the interrelation between the weighted ordering cone to standard dominance concepts of multi-objective optimization, like, e.g., Pareto dominance, lexicographic dominance and weighted sum dominance.</description>

      <title>The Sequence Reconstruction of Permutations under Hamming Metric with Small Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02844v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem asks for the recovery of a sequence from multiple noisy copies, where each copy may contain up to $r$ errors. In the case of permutations on \(n\) letters under the Hamming metric, this problem is closely related to the parameter $N(n,r)$, the maximum intersection size of two Hamming balls of radius $r$. While previous work has resolved \(N(n,r)\) for small radii (\(r \leq 4\)) and established asymptotic bounds for larger \(r\), we present new exact formulas for \(r \in \{5,6,7\}\) using group action techniques. In addition, we develop a formula for \(N(n,r)\) based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group \(S_n\), along with an algorithm that enables computation of \(N(n,r)\) for larger parameters, including cases such as \(N(43,8)\) and \(N(24,14)\).</description>

      <title>Flat simplices and kissing polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider how flat a lattice simplex contained in the hypercube $[0,k]^d$ can be. This question is related to the notion of kissing polytopes: two lattice polytopes contained in the hypercube $[0,k]^d$ are kissing when they are disjoint but their distance is as small as possible. We show that the smallest possible distance of a lattice point $P$ contained in the cube $[0,k]^3$ to a lattice triangle in the same cube that does not contain $P$ is $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3k^4-4k^3+4k^2-2k+1}} $$ when $k$ is at least $2$. We also improve the known lower bounds on the distance of kissing polytopes for $d$ at least $4$ and $k$ at least $2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $I$ be a monomial ideal of a polynomial ring $R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ over a field $K$ and let ${\rm sgn}(I)$ be its signature ideal. If $I$ is not a principal ideal, we show that the depth of $R/I$ is the depth of $R/{\rm sgn}(I)$, and the regularity of $R/{\rm sgn}(I)$ is at most the regularity of $R/I$. For ideals of height at least $2$, we show that the height and the associated primes of $I$ and its signature ${\rm sgn}(I)$ are the same, and we show that $I$ is Cohen--Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein) if and only if ${\rm sgn}(I)$ is Cohen--Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein), and furthermore we show that the v-number of ${\rm sgn}(I)$ is at most the v-number of $I$. We give an algorithm to compute the signature of a monomial ideal using \textit{Macaulay}$2$, and an algorithm to examine given families of monomial ideal by computing their signature ideals and determining which of these are either Cohen--Macaulay or Gorenstein.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>

Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result extends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a super-family of paths. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Hanf numbers for poset games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two well partial orders $(P;\leq_P)$ and $(T;\leq_T)$, each with a minimum element, we study the following question: which player has a winning strategy for Chomp on the poset $(P\times T;\leq_{P\times T})$? Here, $(P\times T;\leq_{P\times T})$ denotes the poset obtained as the Cartesian product of $P$ and $T$, equipped with the corresponding lexicographic order. The answer to this very natural question depends strongly on the specific choice of $(P;\leq_P)$ and $(T;\leq_T)$. For this reason, we restrict our attention to classes of posets given by powers of a fixed poset: $\{(P^\sigma;\leq_{P^\sigma})\mid \sigma\in\mathrm{Ord}\}$. A fundamental fact about these classes of structures is that, if the second player does not have a winning strategy for all the posets in $\{(P^\sigma;\leq_{P^\sigma})\mid \sigma\in\mathrm{Ord}\}$, there exists an ordinal $\xi$ such that the second player has a winning strategy on $(P^{\xi};\leq_{P^{\xi}})$ but not on $(P^{\gamma};\leq_{P^{\gamma}})$ for all $\gamma\geq\xi+1$. Determining the corresponding ordinal for this Hanf number-style property constitutes the main objective of this work.
  Inspired by results of Garc\'ia-Marco and Knauer, we focus on classes of posets with a purely algebraic definition. These posets arise from submonoids (with respect to the natural sum, or Hessenberg sum) of ordinals of the form $\omega^\sigma$ and are generated by sets of ordinals. In the process, we provide a test to determine whether a finite set $\Gamma$ of ordinals indeed yields well partial orders, and, using set-theoretic techniques, we establish an upper bound for the ordinal $\xi$: if $\Gamma\subset\omega$, then $\xi&lt;\omega_1$, and otherwise $\xi&lt;|\bigcup\Gamma|^+$.</description>

      <title>Vertex evaluation of multiplex graphs using Forman Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of vertices that play a central role in network analysis is a fundamental challenge. Although traditional centrality measures have been extensively employed for this purpose, the increasing complexity of modern networks necessitates the use of sophisticated metrics. The concept of Forman curvature has recently garnered significant attention as a promising approach. We define the Forman curvature for multiplex graphs, which are a category of complex networks characterized by multiple layers of connections between nodes. We then prove the key properties of the Forman curvature in the context of multiplex graphs and show its usefulness in identifying vertices occupying central positions within these networks. Moreover, through a series of comparative experiments with traditional graph features and graph kernels, we demonstrate that the Forman curvature can function as an effective metric for classifying the overall structure of networks.</description>

      <title>Minimal Simplicial Degree $d$ Maps from Genus $g$ Surfaces to the Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a fundamental concept in topology, offering deep insights into the structure of the manifolds and the nature of the corresponding maps. This concept has been extensively studied, particularly in the context of simplicial maps between orientable triangulable spaces. In 1982, Gromov proved that if degree $d$ maps exist from a genus $g$ orientable surface to a genus $h$ orientable surface for every $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $h$ must be 0 or 1.
  Recently, degree $d$ self-maps on spheres, particularly on genus 0 surfaces, have been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the unique minimal 7-vertex triangulation of the torus. We construct simplicial degree $d$ maps from a triangulation of a genus $g$ surface to the 7-vertex triangulation of the torus for $g \geq 1$. Our construction of degree $d$ maps is minimal for every $d$ when $g = 1,2$. If $g \geq 3$, then our construction remains minimal for $|d| \geq 2g - 1$.
  We believe that this concept will be highly useful in combinatorial topology, as it leads to several intriguing open research problems. In the final section, we propose some of these open research problems.</description>

      <title>Maximal transitivity of the cactus group on standard Young tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The action of the cactus group $C_n$ on Young tableaux of a given shape $\lambda$ goes back to Berenstein and Kirillov and arises naturally in the study of crystal bases and quantum integrable systems. We show that this action is $2$-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $\lambda$ if and only if $\lambda$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the alternating group, and prove that both cases are possible for infinitely many $\lambda$ (though the alternating group is more frequent). As an application, this implies that the Galois group of solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group $GL_d$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases.</description>

Abstract: Ryser conjectured that every $r$-edge-coloured complete graph can be covered by $r-1$ monochromatic trees. Motivated by a question of Austin in analysis, Mili\'cevi\'c predicted something stronger -- that every $r$-edge-coloured complete graph can be covered by $r-1$ monochromatic trees \emph{of bounded diameter}. Here we show that the two conjectures are equivalent. As immediate corollaries we obtain new results about Mili\'cevi\'c's Conjecture, most notably that it is true for $r=5$. We also obtain several new cases of a generalization of Mili\'cevi\'c's Conjecture to non-complete graphs due to DeBiasio-Kamel-McCourt-Sheats.</description>

      <title>K-promotion on m-packed labelings of posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schutzenberger's promotion operator, pro, is a fundamental map in dynamical algebraic combinatorics. At first, its action was mainly considered on standard Young tableaux. But pro was subsequently shown to have interesting properties when applied to natural labelings of other posets. Pechenik defined a K-theoretic version of promotion, pro_K, on m-packed labelings of tableaux. The operator pro was then extended to increasing labelings of other posets. The purpose of the current work is to show that the original action of pro_K on m-packed labelings yields interesting results when applied to partially ordered sets in general, and to rooted trees in particular. We show that under certain conditions, the sizes of the orbits and order of pro_K exhibit nice divisibility properties. We also completely determine, for certain values of m, the orbit sizes for the action on various types of rooted trees such as extended stars, combs, zippers, and a type of three-leaved tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mutation theory for quivers with oriented 2-cycles using a structure called a homotopy, defined as a normal subgroupoid of the quiver's fundamental groupoid. This framework extends Fomin-Zelevinsky mutations of 2-acyclic quivers and yields involutive mutations that preserve the fundamental groupoid quotient by the homotopy. It generalizes orbit mutations arising from quiver coverings and allows for infinite mutation sequences even when orbit mutations are obstructed. We further construct quivers with homotopies from triangulations of marked surfaces with colored punctures, and prove that flips correspond to mutations, extending the Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston model to the setting with 2-cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20167v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any function $f$ from a finite set $Y$ to itself can be represented linearly. Specifically, we prove the existence of an injective map $j$ from $Y$ into a modular ring $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ and a constant $a \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ such that $j(f(y)) = a \cdot j(y)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ holds for all $y \in Y$. This result is established by analyzing the algebraic properties of the adjugate of the characteristic matrix associated with the function's digraph. The proof is constructive, providing a method for finding the embedding $j$, the modulus $m$, and the linear multiplier $a$.</description>

Abstract: The sensitivity, $\sigma(G)$, of a finite undirected simple graph $G$ is the smallest maximum degree of an induced subgraph on more than the maximum number of independent vertices. Call an indexed family of graphs $G_n$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G_n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ sensitive if $\sigma(G_n) \to \infty$, and insensitive otherwise. We describe sensitivity under the join operation and decomposition into stable blocks and construct sensitive and insensitive, primarily non-regular, graph families. We determine the sensitivity explicitly for numerous singly- and doubly-indexed graph families, including certain generalized joins - e.g., complete multipartite graphs and some generalized windmill graphs; general rooted products; and families of corona graphs.</description>

We then develop a type-independent proof of the Giambelli formula for the Peterson variety, and use this formula to compute the intersection multiplicity of a Peterson variety with an opposite Schubert variety corresponding to a Coxeter word. Finally, we develop an equivariant Chevalley formula for the cap product of a divisor class with a fundamental class, and a dual Monk rule, for the Peterson variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04853v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Bergelson, Tao, and Ziegler \cite{btz} that every Host--Kra $\F_p^\omega$-system of order $k$ is an Abramov system of order $k$. This conjecture has been verified for $k \leq p+1$. In this paper we show that the conjecture fails when $k=5, p=2$. We in fact establish a stronger (combinatorial) statement, in that we produce a bounded function $f: \F_2^n \to \C$ of large Gowers norm $\|f\|_{U^6(\F_2^n)}$ which (as per the inverse theorem for that norm) correlates with a non-classical quintic phase polynomial $e(P)$, but with the property that all such phase polynomials $e(P)$ are ``non-measurable'' in the sense that they cannot be well approximated by functions of a bounded number of random translates of $f$. A simpler version of our construction can also be used to answer a question of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy \cite{CGSS}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural generating set for a Galois extension regarded as the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial is introduced and investigated here. Minimal generating sets arising in this context throw many surprises compared to the analogous concept in linear algebra: they can be of different cardinalities. In fact we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also study how minimal generating sets behave under multiple transitivity of the Galois group and consequently prove the existence of polynomials with all minimal generating sets of uniformly same cardinality. We also connect minimal generating sets with the concept of root cluster tower of an irreducible polynomial introduced by the second author and Krithika in [8].</description>

The proof translates a result of Ramanujan on Ramanujan sums, equivalent to the prime number theorem, to the setting of infinite products. We also show that similar identities proved by Ramanujan lead to additional results on infinite cyclotomic products.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviour of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations. This model is also bijectively equivalent to the Fortuin--Kasteleyn model of planar maps with parameter $q\in (0,4)$ at its self-dual point. These have been traditionally studied using either techniques from analytic combinatorics (based in particular on the gasket decomposition of Borot, Bouttier and Guitter arXiv:1106.0153) or probabilistic arguments (based on Sheffield's hamburger-cheeseburger bijection arXiv:1108.2241). In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for geometric features of the FK model of planar maps when $0 &lt; q &lt;4$, such as the exact tail behaviour of the perimeters of clusters and loops. This sharpens previous results of arXiv:1502.00450 and arXiv:1502.00546. A key step is to use the above dictionary and the probabilistic results to justify rigorously an ansatz commonly assumed in the analytic combinatorics literature.</description>
