      <title>Araucaria: Simplifying INC Fault Tolerance with High-Level Intents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network programmability allows modification of fine-grain data plane functionality. The performance benefits of data plane programmability have motivated many researchers to offload computation that previously operated only on servers to the network, creating the notion of in-network computing (INC). Because failures can occur in the data plane, fault tolerance mechanisms are essential for INC. However, INC operators and developers must manually set fault tolerance requirements using domain knowledge to change the source code. These manually set requirements may take time and lead to errors in case of misconfiguration. In this work, we present Araucaria, a system that aims to simplify the definition and implementation of fault tolerance requirements for INC. The system allows requirements specification using an intent language, which enables the expression of consistency and availability requirements in a constrained natural language. A refinement process translates the intent and incorporates the essential building blocks and configurations into the INC code. We present a prototype of Araucaria and analyze the end-to-end system behavior. Experiments demonstrate that the refinement scales to multiple intents and that the system provides fault tolerance with negligible overhead in failure scenarios.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Orchestration of Energy-Efficient Gossip Learning Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully distributed learning schemes such as Gossip Learning (GL) are gaining momentum due to their scalability and effectiveness even in dynamic settings. However, they often imply a high utilization of communication and computing resources, whose energy footprint may jeopardize the learning process, particularly on battery-operated IoT devices. To address this issue, we present Optimized Gossip Learning (OGL)}, a distributed training approach based on the combination of GL with adaptive optimization of the learning process, which allows for achieving a target accuracy while minimizing the energy consumption of the learning process. We propose a data-driven approach to OGL management that relies on optimizing in real-time for each node the number of training epochs and the choice of which model to exchange with neighbors based on patterns of node contacts, models' quality, and available resources at each node. Our approach employs a DNN model for dynamic tuning of the aforementioned parameters, trained by an infrastructure-based orchestrator function. We performed our assessments on two different datasets, leveraging time-varying random graphs and a measurement-based dynamic urban scenario. Results suggest that our approach is highly efficient and effective in a broad spectrum of network scenarios.</description>

      <title>SAFLA: Semantic-aware Full Lifecycle Assurance Designed for Intent-Driven Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent-driven Networks (IDNs) are crucial in enhancing network management efficiency by enabling the translation of high-level intents into executable configurations via a top-down approach. The escalating complexity of network architectures, however, has led to a semantic gap between these intents and their actual configurations, posing significant challenges to the accuracy and reliability of IDNs. While existing methodologies attempt to address this gap through a bottom-up analysis of network metadata, they often fall short, focusing primarily on intent extraction or reasoning without fully leveraging insights to tackle the inherent challenges of IDNs. To mitigate this, we introduce SAFLA, a semantic-aware framework specifically designed to assure the full lifecycle of intents within IDNs. By seamlessly integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches, SAFLA not only provides comprehensive intent assurance but also effectively bridges the semantic gap. This integration facilitates a self-healing mechanism, substantially reducing the need for manual intervention even in dynamically changing network environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's feasibility and efficiency, confirming its capacity to quickly adapt intents in response to network changes, thus marking an important advancement in the field of IDNs.</description>

      <title>Through the Lens of Google CrUX: Dissecting Web Browsing Experience Across Devices and Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User quality of experience in the context of Web browsing is being researched widely, with plenty of developments occurring alongside technological advances, not seldom driven by big industry players. With the huge reach and infrastructure of Google, the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) provides quantitative real-life measurement data of a vast magnitude. Analysis of this steadily expanding dataset aggregating different user experience metrics, yields tangible insights into actual trends and developments. Hence, this paper is the first to study the CrUX dataset from the viewpoint of relevant metrics by quantitative evaluation of users Web browsing experience across three device types and nine European countries. Analysis of data segmented by connection type in the device dimension shows desktops outperforming other device types for all metrics. Similar analysis in the country dimension, shows North European countries (Sweden, Finland) having maximum 4G connections (85.99%, 81.41% respectively) and steadily performing 25%-36% better at the 75th percentile across all metrics compared to the worst performing country. Such a high-level longitudinal analysis of real-life Web browsing experience provides an extensive base for future research.</description>

      <title>A Paradigm For Collaborative Pervasive Fog Computing Ecosystems at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the success of edge and fog computing increased with the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, such novel computing paradigm, that moves compute resources closer to the source of data and services, must address many challenges such as reducing communication overhead to/from datacenters, the latency to compute and receive results, as well as energy consumption at the mobile and IoT devices. fog-to-fog (f2f) cooperation has recently been proposed to increase the computation capacity at the network edge through cooperation across multiple stakeholders. In this paper we adopt an analytical approach to studying f2f cooperation paradigm. We highlight the benefits of using such new paradigm in comparison with traditional three-tier fog computing paradigms. We use a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model for the N f2f cooperating nodes and cast cooperation as an optimization problem, which we solve using the proposed model.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of RIS-assisted Networks with HQAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted networks, specifically focusing on its efficiency in reducing the number of required reflecting elements. Specifically, we present analytical expressions for the average symbol error probability (ASEP) and propose a new metric for conditioned energy efficiency, which assesses the network energy consumption while ensuring the ASEP remains below a certain threshold. Additionally, we introduce an innovative detection algorithm for HQAM constellations that implements sphere decoding in O(1) complexity. Finally, our study reveals that HQAM significantly enhances both the ASEP and energy efficiency compared to traditional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes.</description>

      <title>SERENE: A Collusion Resilient Replication-based Verification Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology is accompanied by substantial challenges, particularly the reliance on remote task execution without ensuring a reliable and accurate returned results. This reliance on external compute servers, which may be malicious or rogue, represents a major security threat. While researchers have been exploring verifiable computing, and replication-based task verification as a simple, fast, and dependable method to assess the correctness of results. However, colluding malicious workers can easily defeat this method. Existing collusion detection and mitigation solutions often require the use of a trusted third party server or verified tasks which may be hard to guarantee, or solutions that assume the presence of a minority of colluding servers. We propose SERENE, a collusion resilient replication-based verification framework that detects, and mitigates colluding workers. Unlike state-of-the-art solutions, SERENE uses a lightweight detection algorithm that detects collusion based on a single verification task. Mitigation requires a two stage process to group the workers and identifying colluding from honest workers. We implement and compare SERENE's performance to Staab et. al, resulting in an average of 50\% and 60\% accuracy improvement in detection and mitigation accuracy respectively.</description>
