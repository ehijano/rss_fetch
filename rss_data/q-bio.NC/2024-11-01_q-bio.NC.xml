      <title>Moral Agency in Silico: Exploring Free Will in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of deterministic systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), to exhibit the functional capacities of moral agency and compatibilist free will. We develop a functional definition of free will grounded in Dennett's compatibilist framework, building on an interdisciplinary theoretical foundation that integrates Shannon's information theory, Dennett's compatibilism, and Floridi's philosophy of information. This framework emphasizes the importance of reason-responsiveness and value alignment in determining moral responsibility rather than requiring metaphysical libertarian free will. Shannon's theory highlights the role of processing complex information in enabling adaptive decision-making, while Floridi's philosophy reconciles these perspectives by conceptualizing agency as a spectrum, allowing for a graduated view of moral status based on a system's complexity and responsiveness. Our analysis of LLMs' decision-making in moral dilemmas demonstrates their capacity for rational deliberation and their ability to adjust choices in response to new information and identified inconsistencies. Thus, they exhibit features of a moral agency that align with our functional definition of free will. These results challenge traditional views on the necessity of consciousness for moral responsibility, suggesting that systems with self-referential reasoning capacities can instantiate degrees of free will and moral reasoning in artificial and biological contexts. This study proposes a parsimonious framework for understanding free will as a spectrum that spans artificial and biological systems, laying the groundwork for further interdisciplinary research on agency and ethics in the artificial intelligence era.</description>

      <title>Choice confidence bridges credit assignment to levels of decision hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everyday decisions often involve many different levels. What connects these higher and lower level decisions hierarchy to one another determines how the cause(s) of failures are interpreted. It is hypothesized that decision confidence guides the assignment of blame to the correct level of hierarchy but this hypothesis has only been tested by manipulation of sensory evidence itself. We examined the consequences of modulating subjective confidence in hierarchical decision making via extra-sensory, social influence. Participants who made hierarchical, motion-plus-bandit decisions also received social information from a partner that advised the participant in the motion task. The strength of social advice -- independently from sensory signals -- modulated the likelihood of strategy change after negative feedback. Our findings therefore provide strong empirical evidence that subjective confidence per se acts as the bridge in assignment of credit and blame to various levels of decision hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Approaches for Revealing Complex Neural Network Dynamics in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) belongs to the class of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the central nervous system. It is usually defined as the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which causes both motor and non-motor symptoms. Understanding the neuronal processes that underlie PD is critical for creating successful therapies. This study combines machine learning (ML), stochastic modelling, and Bayesian inference with connectomic data to analyze the brain networks involved in PD. We use modern computational methods to study large-scale neural networks to identify neuronal activity patterns related to PD development. We aim to define the subtle structural and functional connection changes in PD brains by combining connectomic with stochastic noises. Stochastic modelling approaches reflect brain dynamics' intrinsic variability and unpredictability, shedding light on the origin and spread of pathogenic events in PD. We employ a novel hybrid model to assess how stochastic noise impacts the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CBGTH) network, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Bayesian inference allows us to quantify uncertainty in model parameters, improving the accuracy of our predictions. Our findings reveal that stochastic disturbances increase thalamus activity, even under deep brain stimulation (DBS). Bayesian analysis suggests that reducing these disturbances could enhance healthy brain states, providing insights for potential therapeutic interventions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of PD dynamics and paves the way for personalized treatment strategies. This is an extended version of our work presented at the ICCS-2024 conference.</description>

      <title>Brain Network Dynamics and Multiscale Modelling of Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential to understand the complex structure of the human brain to develop new treatment approaches for neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). This review paper comprehensively discusses the challenges associated with modelling the complex brain networks and dynamic processes involved in NDDs, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cortical spreading depression (CSD). We investigate how the brain's biological processes and associated multiphysics interact and how this influences the structure and functionality of the brain. We review the literature on brain network models and dynamic processes, highlighting the need for sophisticated mathematical and statistical modelling techniques. Specifically, we go through large-scale brain network models relevant to AD and PD, highlighting the pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies investigated in the literature. Additionally, we investigate the propagation of CSD in the brain and its implications for neurological disorders. Furthermore, we discuss how data-driven approaches and artificial neural networks refine and validate models related to NDDs. Overall, this review underscores the significance of coupled multiscale models in deciphering disease mechanisms, offering potential avenues for therapeutic development and advancing our understanding of pathological brain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal activity patterns induced by triadic interactions in an in silico neural medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are general mechanisms by which a node or neuron can regulate directly the link or synapse between other two neurons. The regulation takes place in a familiar way by either depressing or facilitating synaptic transmission. Such interactions are ubiquitous in neural systems, accounting for axo-axonic synapses and tripartite synapses mediated by astrocytes, for instance, and have been related to neuronal and synaptic processes at different time-scales, including short and long-term synaptic plasticity. In the field of network science, triadic interactions have been shown to produce complex spatio-temporal patterns of connectivity. Here, we investigate the emergent behavior of an in silico neural medium constituted by a population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with triadic interactions. We observe that, depending on relevant parameters defining triadic interactions, different activity patterns emerge. These include i) a silent phase, ii) a low-activity phase in which complex spatio-temporal patterns of low neuronal firing rate emerge that propagate through the medium, iii) a high-activity phase characterized by complex spatio-temporal patterns of high neuronal firing rate that propagate through the neural medium as waves of high firing activity over a bulk of low activity neurons, and iv) a pseudo-blinking phase in which the neural medium switches between high and low activity states, in a similar fashion to up/down state transitions. Here we analyse in depth the features of such patterns and relate our findings to the recently proposed model of triadic percolation.</description>

      <title>Criticality at work: scaling in the mouse cortex enhances performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural systems operate near a phase transition, optimising the transmission, storage, and processing of information. While scale invariance and non-Gaussian dynamics - hallmarks of criticality - have been observed in brain activity, a direct link between criticality and behavioural performance remains unexplored. Here, we use a phenomenological renormalisation group (PRG) approach to examine neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of mice performing a visual recognition task. We show that non-trivial scaling in neuronal activity is associated with enhanced task performance, with pronounced scaling observed during successful task completion. When rewards were removed or non-natural stimuli presented, these scaling signatures diminished. These results suggest that critical dynamics in the brain may be crucial for optimising behavioural outcomes, offering new insights into the functional role of criticality in cortical processing.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in spiking neural networks: A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to review recent research on the collective behaviour of excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) spiking neural networks. The research methodology used is Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) procedures, comprising three primary stages: an initial search for literature in the SCOPUS database, a screening process based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a review of the selected literatures. Out of 491 documents from 2014 to 2024, 6 research papers are qualified for review. Four distinct dynamical states have been identified: synchrony, irregular behaviour, stationary state, and oscillatory dynamics. Our review findings suggest that the collective dynamics of E-I spiking neurons stem from the interaction of intrinsic neuronal characteristics, balance mechanisms, and the type of external stimuli. Additionally, the widespread use of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons in the literature highlights its significance as a robust candidate for exploring collective behaviours in large-scale neuronal networks.</description>

      <title>Generative forecasting of brain activity enhances Alzheimer's classification and interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between cognition and intrinsic brain activity through purely data-driven approaches remains a significant challenge in neuroscience. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers a non-invasive method to monitor regional neural activity, providing a rich and complex spatiotemporal data structure. Deep learning has shown promise in capturing these intricate representations. However, the limited availability of large datasets, especially for disease-specific groups such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), constrains the generalizability of deep learning models. In this study, we focus on multivariate time series forecasting of independent component networks derived from rs-fMRI as a form of data augmentation, using both a conventional LSTM-based model and the novel Transformer-based BrainLM model. We assess their utility in AD classification, demonstrating how generative forecasting enhances classification performance. Post-hoc interpretation of BrainLM reveals class-specific brain network sensitivities associated with AD.</description>

      <title>RealMind: Zero-Shot EEG-Based Visual Decoding and Captioning Using Multi-Modal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in visual decoding with fMRI data, its high cost and low temporal resolution limit widespread applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce RealMind, a novel EEG-based visual decoding framework that leverages multi-modal models to efficiently interpret semantic information. By integrating semantic and geometric consistency learning, RealMind enhances feature alignment, leading to improved decoding performance. Our framework achieves a 56.73\% Top-5 accuracy in a 200-way retrieval task and a 26.59\% BLEU-1 score in a 200-way visual captioning task, representing the first successful attempt at zero-shot visual captioning using EEG data. RealMind provides a robust, adaptable, and cost-effective alternative to fMRI-based methods, offering scalable solutions for EEG-based visual decoding in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems are increasingly popular tools in neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Measures comparing neural activations across conditions, architectures, and species give scalable ways to understand information transformation within different neural networks. However, recent findings show that some metrics respond to spurious signals, leading to misleading results. Establishing benchmark test cases is thus essential for identifying the most reliable metric and potential improvements. We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identify representations that develop throughout learning and determine if representations identified by metrics reflect the network's actual computations. Building both attractor and RNN based test cases, we show that the recently proposed Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and reliably identifies behaviorally relevant representations compared to prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also demonstrate how such test cases can extend beyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSA in modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs, may not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hidden states. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced ability to detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoing computations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.</description>

      <title>A stochastic explanation for observed local-to-global foraging states in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.</description>

      <title>Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</description>

      <title>Brain-like Functional Organization within Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.</description>
