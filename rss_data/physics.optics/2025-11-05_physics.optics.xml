      <title>A Calibration Method for Indirect Time-of-Flight Cameras to Eliminate Internal Scattering Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-camera light scattering is a typical form of non-systematic interference in indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) cameras, primarily caused by multiple reflections and optical path variations within the camera body. This effect can significantly reduce the accuracy of background depth measurements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a calibration-based model derived from real measurement data, introducing three physically interpretable calibration parameters: a normal-exposure amplitude influence coefficient, an overexposure amplitude influence coefficient, and a scattering phase shift coefficient. These parameters are used to describe the effects of foreground size, exposure conditions, and optical path differences on scattering interference. Experimental results show that the depth values calculated using the calibrated parameters can effectively compensate for scattering-induced errors, significantly improving background depth recovery in scenarios with complex foreground geometries and varying illumination conditions. This approach provides a practical, low-cost solution for iToF systems, requiring no complex hardware modifications, and can substantially enhance measurement accuracy and robustness across a wide range of real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Recurrent nonlinear modulational instability via down-conversion in quadratic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the induced modulation instability in second-harmonic generation beyond the early stage of the linearized growth of the modulation. We find a regime of recurrence (quasi-periodic conversion and back-conversion between the pump and the modulation) which is genuine of the parametric conversion process in quadratic media. Such recurrence is mainly driven by a process of non-degenerate downconversion, showing no analogy to the cascading regime which mimics the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearities. We consider two different steady states, i.e., a pure second-harmonic and a mixed fundamental/second-harmonic state. Both exhibit this dynamics, which we show to be amenable to a description in terms of reduced frequency-truncated models. The comparison with full numerical simulations of the starting model prove the validity and robustness of the reduced models in characterizing in a simple and elegant way a wide range of modulationally-unstable steady states.</description>

      <title>Extending Reflectometry Range, A Zero-Crossing Algorithm for Thick Film Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and high-efficiency film metrology remains a key challenge in High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM), where conventional spectroscopic reflectometry and white light interferometry (WLI) are either limited by model dependence or throughput. In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of reflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the Linearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the previously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but eliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that degrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and extracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and repeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable accuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional model-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina films over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and low gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&amp;R &lt; 3%). Moreover, LRZ achieves an average Move-Acquire-Measure (MAM) time of approximately 2 s, which is about 7 times faster than WLI. The proposed method enables fast, accurate, and model-independent optical metrology for thick films, offering a practical solution for advanced HVM process control.</description>

      <title>Process-structure-property relationships in subtractive fabrication of silicon nitride microresonators for nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) has emerged as a popular platform for nonlinear photonics due to its large bandgap, relatively large nonlinear index of refraction, and high degree of CMOS-compatibility. Nonlinear optical processes in microresonators require both large quality factors to promote build-up of large intracavity powers and sufficient control over resonator dispersion to implement phase-matching, which is generally achieved through careful design and fabrication of the resonator cross-sectional dimensions. Additionally, generating dissipative Kerr soliton optical frequency combs requires operation in the anomalous dispersion regime, which calls for such thick layers of SiN as to make achieving accuracy during etching a challenge. In this work, we investigate the relationship between fabrication process details, including lithography and etching, and optical properties, such as optical loss and resonator dispersion, for two different subtractive fabrication approaches: one utilizing a polymer-based electron beam resist as the protective mask during etching and the other employing a thin metallic etch-mask. Using both approaches, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of polymer and metal etch-masks, determine the origins of optical loss through variations in electron beam lithography parameters, and connect resonator sidewall roughness to optical loss. Finally, we compare frequency comb generation in resonators fabricated using either approach.</description>

      <title>Lithium Niobate Vertical Cavity Electro-Optic Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) are vital for optical imaging and information processing, with free-space devices enabling LiDAR and beam control. Lithium niobate (LN), powered by the strong Pockels effect and scalable LN-on-insulator (LNOI) platform, has become a leading material for high-performance EOMs. Here we realize a vertical-cavity EOM in which an LN membrane is sandwiched between two photonic crystal (PhC) mirrors with integrated electrodes. The cavity supports sharp defect-mode resonances that shift efficiently under the Pockels effect, enabling strong modulation of transmission. Experiments show a depth of 43 % at 50 V and a bandwidth of 5 MHz. This architecture combines free-space compatibility with fabrication simplicity, opening new routes to compact electro-optic platforms for ranging, holography, and beam steering.</description>

      <title>Local Wigner-Mass Maps and Integrated Negativity as Measures of nonclassicality in Quantum Chaotic Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner function is a phase space quasi-probability distribution whose negative regions provide a direct, local signature of nonclassicality. To identify where phase-sensitive structure concentrates, we introduce local positive- and negative Wigner-mass maps and adopt the integrated Wigner negativity as a compact scalar measure of nonclassical phase space structure. A decomposition of the density operator reveals that off-diagonal coherences between hybridizing components generate oscillatory, sign-alternating patterns, with the negative contribution maximized when component weights are comparable. Non-Gaussian chaotic eigenmodes exhibit a baseline negativity that is further amplified by such hybridization. We validate these diagnostics across two billiard geometries and argue that the framework is transferable to other wave-chaotic platforms, where it can aid mode engineering and coherence control.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of on-chip all-optical switching of magnetization in integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast all-optical magnetization switching (AOS) holds great promise for nextgeneration spintronic memory and hybrid spintronic-photonic systems. However, most implementations to date rely on bulky free-space optical setups, limiting scalability and practical integration. As a critical step toward integrated applications, we demonstrate single-pulse AOS within a silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuit. Using trains of femtosecond laser pulses guided through on-chip waveguides, we achieve deterministic toggle switching in a sub-micron out-of-plane Co/Gd Hall cross patterned directly atop the photonic waveguide. Electrical readout via the anomalous Hall effect reveals a switching contrast of up to 90% for 500 nm-wide devices. In larger Hall crosses, the contrast decreases and switching becomes stochastic, consistent with spatially non-uniform optical absorption as confirmed by finite-element simulations. This behavior is hypothetically attributed to domain wall relaxation and thermally assisted (de)pinning processes within partially switched regions. Our results highlight the critical role of device scaling in achieving robust on-chip AOS and establish a foundation for ultrafast, energy-efficient, and fully integrated spintronic-photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Routes for Light Management in Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully-textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. The optical functions of full texturing, however, are not yet fully understood. A key challenge is the requirement for perovskite layer texturing, which often leads to increased electrical losses. Here, we elucidate the distinct optical roles of front and rear textures in tandem configurations using optical simulations and use these insights to propose a new architecture that eliminates the need for perovskite surface texturing. We demonstrate that our proposed structure achieves optical results comparable to those of fully-textured devices, while its planar perovskite layer has the potential to reduce electrical losses. The high optical performance also results in higher efficiency if a texture-induced voltage loss as low as 50 mV is assumed, which is about six times lower than the loss of fully-textured devices, thus enabling higher efficiencies within a simplified design. Our results show that perovskite texturing is not essential for optimal light management, thus opening the way to combine efficient light management with high electrical performance.</description>

      <title>Topologically Quantized Soliton-Like Pumping using Synthetic Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between nonlinear and topological physics has led to intriguing emergent phenomena, such as quantized and fractionally quantized Thouless pumping of solitons dictated by the topological invariants of the underlying band structure. Unlike linear Thouless pumping, which requires excitation of a Wannier function of a uniformly filled band, quantized soliton pumping is observed even with localized excitations that do not represent Wannier functions. Here, we show that similar soliton-like quantized pumping can be observed in Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model by introducing a synthetic nonlinearity in the form of a cutoff on the coupling strengths between lattice sites. More importantly, we reveal that the localized excitations driving quantized soliton pumping are precisely the Wannier functions of the uniformly filled bands of the effectively nonlinear lattice, thus restoring consistency with linear Thouless pumping. We extend this approach to multi-band systems and show that the nonlinearity introduces a degeneracy between bands, subsequently leading to the observation of fractionally quantized pumping. Our approach of introducing a synthetic nonlinearity is general and could be extended to reveal soliton dynamics in other nonlinear topological systems.</description>

      <title>All-optical turbulence mitigation for free-space quantum key distribution using stimulated parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and demonstrate a turbulence-resilient scheme for free-space quantum communication. By leveraging the phase conjugation property of stimulated parametric down-conversion, our scheme enables all-optical dynamic correction of spatial-mode distortion induced by atmospheric turbulence, thereby enhancing the secure key rate in high-dimensional quantum key distribution. We develop a theoretical model that provides detailed guidelines for selecting the optimal basis and spatial properties needed to maximize the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Both numerical simulations and experimental results show that, even under strong turbulence, our scheme can reduce the quantum error rates well below the security threshold. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear optical approaches as powerful tools for robust quantum communication in realistic free-space environments. Our work could have important implications for the practical implementation of secure quantum channels over long free-space distances.</description>

      <title>Localized to delocalized spatial quantum correlation evolution in structured bright twin beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the spatial domain hold great promise for applications in quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and quantum information processing, owing to the infinite dimensionality of the associated Hilbert space. Here, we present a theoretical investigation, complemented by experimental measurements, of the propagation dynamics of the spatial quantum correlations in bright structured twin beams generated via a four-wave mixing process in a double-$\Lambda$ configuration in atomic vapor. We derive an analytical expression describing the evolution of the spatial quantum correlation distribution from the near field to the far field. To qualitatively support the theoretical predictions, we perform experiments measuring intensity-difference noise between different spatial subregions of the twin beams as they propagate from the near field to the far field. The presence of quantum correlations is manifested as squeezing in the intensity difference noise measurement. With a Gaussian pump, we observe localized correlations in the near field and localized anti-correlations in the far field. In contrast, with a structured Laguerre-Gaussian pump, there is a transition from localized correlations in the near field to delocalized correlations in the far field. The present results offer valuable insights into the fundamental behavior of spatial quantum correlations and open possibilities for potential applications in quantum information, quantum imaging and sensing.</description>

      <title>Temporal filtered quantum sensing with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond are among the leading solid state quantum platforms, offering exceptional spatial resolution and sensitivity for applications such as magnetic field sensing, thermometry, and bioimaging. However, in high background environments,such as those encountered in in vitro diagnostics, the performance of NV based sensors can be compromised by strong background fluorescence, particularly from substrates such as nitrocellulose. In this work, we analytically and experimentally investigate the use of pulsed laser excitation combined with time gating techniques to suppress background fluorescence and enhance the signal to noise ratio in NV based quantum sensing, with an emphasis on spin enhanced biosensing. Through experimental studies using mixed ensembles of silicon vacancy and NV centers in bulk diamond, as well as fluorescent nanodiamonds on NC substrates, we demonstrate significant improvements in NV spin resonance visibility, demonstrated by an increase of the SNR by up to 4x, and a resulting measurement time reduction by 16x. The presented technique and results here can help significantly increase the readout efficiency and speed in future applications of NV centers in high background environments, such as in IVD, where the NV centers are used as a fluorescent label for biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of single B centers in hBN by one-to-one conversion from UV centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the variety of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers, or B centers, have gathered a particular interest owing to their excellent quantum optical properties. Moreover, the fact that they can be locally activated by an electron beam makes them suitable for top-down integration in photonic devices. However, in the absence of a real-time monitoring technique sensitive to individual emitters, the activation process is stochastic in the number of emitters, and its mechanism is under debate. Here, we implement an in-situ cathodoluminescence monitoring setup capable of detecting individual quantum emitters in the blue and ultraviolet (UV) range. We demonstrate that the activation of individual B centers is spatially and temporally correlated with the deactivation of individual UV centers emitting at 4.1 eV, which are ubiquitous in hBN. We then make use of the ability to detect individual B center activation events to demonstrate the controlled creation of an array with only one emitter per irradiation site. Additionally, we demonstrate a symmetric technique for heralded selective deactivation of individual emitters. Our results provide insights into the microscopic structure and activation mechanism of B centers, as well as versatile techniques for their deterministic integration.</description>

      <title>X-ray microcomputed tomography of 3D chaotic microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic microcavities play a crucial role in several research areas, including the study of unidirectional microlasers, nonlinear optics, sensing, quantum chaos, and non-Hermitian physics. To date, most theoretical and experimental explorations have focused on two-dimensional (2D) chaotic dielectric microcavities, while there have been minimal studies on three-dimensional (3D) ones since precise geometrical information of a 3D microcavity can be difficult to obtain. Here, we image 3D microcavities with submicron resolution using X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro CT), enabling nondestructive imaging that preserves the sample for subsequent use. By analyzing the ray dynamics of a typical deformed microsphere, we demonstrate that a sufficient deformation along all three dimensions can lead to chaotic ray trajectories over extended time scales. Notably, using the X-ray micro CT reconstruction results, the phase space chaotic ray dynamics of a deformed microsphere are accurately established. X-ray micro CT could become a unique platform for the characterization of such deformed 3D microcavities by providing a precise means for determining the degree of deformation necessary for potential applications in ray chaos and quantum chaos.</description>

Abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) enables orientational polarimetry for crystallographic analysis and domain imaging of various materials. However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Tactile Displays Driven by Projected Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could transform computing interactions. However, achieving the resolution, speed, and dynamic range needed for perceptual fidelity remains challenging. We present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns via a photomechanical surface populated with millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through photostimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding millimeter scale displacements with response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Employing projected light for power transmission and addressing renders these displays highly scalable. We demonstrate optically driven displays with up to 1,511 addressable pixels -- several times more pixels than any prior tactile display attaining comparable performance. Perceptual studies confirm that these displays can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns with high fidelity. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase in anisotropic Kepler problem: Perspective for realization in Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We argue that in Rydberg states with a large principal quantum number a similar geometric angle can be generated by mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s and $1~$ms.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.</description>

      <title>Free-space multi-user quantum network with high key rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent quantum networks are the essential ingredient for securely connecting multiple users worldwide, extensively deployed in both fibre and free-space. An essential element is the multiplexing of entanglement to multiple users, overcoming the peer-to-peer restriction of quantum key distribution (QKD), so far successfully shown in fibre-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate a free-space quantum space division multiplexing architecture using just one entanglement source to realise a fully connected twelve-channel quantum network for seamless QKD connections between six users. The network achieves record coincidence rates exceeding $3 \times 10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$ between any pair of nodes on the network, for sifted key rate of over 400 kbps. Our approach overcomes the active switching hurdle that has hindered the free-space deployment of quantum multiplexing, is fully passive, easily scalable to more nodes and compatible with fibre-based integration, thus opening a new path to scalable and resource-efficient quantum networks that utilise free-space links.</description>
