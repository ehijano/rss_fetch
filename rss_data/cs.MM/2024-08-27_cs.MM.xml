      <title>SpeechCraft: A Fine-grained Expressive Speech Dataset with Natural Language Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-language multi-modal learning presents a significant challenge due to the fine nuanced information inherent in speech styles. Therefore, a large-scale dataset providing elaborate comprehension of speech style is urgently needed to facilitate insightful interplay between speech audio and natural language. However, constructing such datasets presents a major trade-off between large-scale data collection and high-quality annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic speech annotation system for expressiveness interpretation that annotates in-the-wild speech clips with expressive and vivid human language descriptions. Initially, speech audios are processed by a series of expert classifiers and captioning models to capture diverse speech characteristics, followed by a fine-tuned LLaMA for customized annotation generation. Unlike previous tag/templet-based annotation frameworks with limited information and diversity, our system provides in-depth understandings of speech style through tailored natural language descriptions, thereby enabling accurate and voluminous data generation for large model training. With this system, we create SpeechCraft, a fine-grained bilingual expressive speech dataset. It is distinguished by highly descriptive natural language style prompts, containing approximately 2,000 hours of audio data and encompassing over two million speech clips. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset significantly boosts speech-language task performance in stylist speech synthesis and speech style understanding.</description>

      <title>Digital Fingerprinting on Multimedia: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of multimedia content in the digital economy era has brought challenges in content recognition, copyright protection, and data management. As an emerging content management technology, perceptual hash-based digital fingerprints, serving as compact summaries of multimedia content, have been widely adopted for efficient multimedia content identification and retrieval across different modalities (e.g., text, image, video, audio), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Despite the increasing applications of digital fingerprints, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive literature review on multimedia digital fingerprints. This survey aims to fill this gap and provide an important resource for researchers studying the details and related advancements of multimedia digital fingerprints. The survey first introduces the definition, characteristics, and related concepts (including hash functions, granularity, similarity measures, etc.) of digital fingerprints. It then focuses on analyzing and summarizing the algorithms for extracting unimodal fingerprints of different types of digital content, including text fingerprints, image fingerprints, video fingerprints, and audio fingerprints. Particularly, it provides an in-depth review and summary of deep learning-based fingerprints. Additionally, the survey elaborates on the various practical applications of digital fingerprints and outlines the challenges and potential future research directions. The goal is to promote the continued development of multimedia digital fingerprint research.</description>

      <title>An Open, Cross-Platform, Web-Based Metaverse Using WebXR and A-Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metaverse has received much attention in the literature and industry in the last few years, but the lack of an open and cross-platform architecture has led to many distinct metaverses that cannot communicate with each other. This work proposes a WebXR-based cross-platform architecture for developing spatial web apps using the A-Frame and Networked-Aframe frameworks with a view to an open and interoperable metaverse, accessible from both the web and extended reality devices. A prototype was implemented and evaluated, supporting the capability of the technology stack to enable immersive experiences across different platforms and devices. Positive feedback on ease of use of the immersive environment further corroborates the proposed approach, underscoring its effectiveness in facilitating engaging and interactive virtual spaces. By adhering to principles of interoperability and inclusivity, it lives up to Tim Berners-Lee's vision of the World Wide Web as an open platform that transcends geographical and technical boundaries.</description>

      <title>SceneDreamer360: Text-Driven 3D-Consistent Scene Generation with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation has seen significant advancements recently. However, most existing methods generate single-view images using generative models and then stitch them together in 3D space. This independent generation for each view often results in spatial inconsistency and implausibility in the 3D scenes. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel text-driven 3D-consistent scene generation model: SceneDreamer360. Our proposed method leverages a text-driven panoramic image generation model as a prior for 3D scene generation and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to ensure consistency across multi-view panoramic images. Specifically, SceneDreamer360 enhances the fine-tuned Panfusion generator with a three-stage panoramic enhancement, enabling the generation of high-resolution, detail-rich panoramic images. During the 3D scene construction, a novel point cloud fusion initialization method is used, producing higher quality and spatially consistent point clouds. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other methods, SceneDreamer360 with its panoramic image generation and 3DGS can produce higher quality, spatially consistent, and visually appealing 3D scenes from any text prompt. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/liwrui/SceneDreamer360}.</description>

      <title>Riemann-based Multi-scale Attention Reasoning Network for Text-3D Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the challenges in acquiring paired Text-3D data and the inherent irregularity of 3D data structures, combined representation learning of 3D point clouds and text remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Riemann-based Multi-scale Attention Reasoning Network (RMARN) for text-3D retrieval. Specifically, the extracted text and point cloud features are refined by their respective Adaptive Feature Refiner (AFR). Furthermore, we introduce the innovative Riemann Local Similarity (RLS) module and the Global Pooling Similarity (GPS) module. However, as 3D point cloud data and text data often possess complex geometric structures in high-dimensional space, the proposed RLS employs a novel Riemann Attention Mechanism to reflect the intrinsic geometric relationships of the data. Without explicitly defining the manifold, RMARN learns the manifold parameters to better represent the distances between text-point cloud samples. To address the challenges of lacking paired text-3D data, we have created the large-scale Text-3D Retrieval dataset T3DR-HIT, which comprises over 3,380 pairs of text and point cloud data. T3DR-HIT contains coarse-grained indoor 3D scenes and fine-grained Chinese artifact scenes, consisting of 1,380 and over 2,000 text-3D pairs, respectively. Experiments on our custom datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Our code and proposed datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/liwrui/RMARN}.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Splicing Artifacts in Partially Fake Speech Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech deepfake detection has recently gained significant attention within the multimedia forensics community. Related issues have also been explored, such as the identification of partially fake signals, i.e., tracks that include both real and fake speech segments. However, generating high-quality spliced audio is not as straightforward as it may appear. Spliced signals are typically created through basic signal concatenation. This process could introduce noticeable artifacts that can make the generated data easier to detect. We analyze spliced audio tracks resulting from signal concatenation, investigate their artifacts and assess whether such artifacts introduce any bias in existing datasets. Our findings reveal that by analyzing splicing artifacts, we can achieve a detection EER of 6.16% and 7.36% on PartialSpoof and HAD datasets, respectively, without needing to train any detector. These results underscore the complexities of generating reliable spliced audio data and lead to discussions that can help improve future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Localization of Synthetic Manipulations in Western Blot Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in deep learning and generative systems have significantly fostered the creation of synthetic media, as well as the local alteration of real content via the insertion of highly realistic synthetic manipulations. Local image manipulation, in particular, poses serious challenges to the integrity of digital content and societal trust. This problem is not only confined to multimedia data, but also extends to biological images included in scientific publications, like images depicting Western blots. In this work, we address the task of localizing synthetic manipulations in Western blot images. To discriminate between pristine and synthetic pixels of an analyzed image, we propose a synthetic detector that operates on small patches extracted from the image. We aggregate patch contributions to estimate a tampering heatmap, highlighting synthetic pixels out of pristine ones. Our methodology proves effective when tested over two manipulated Western blot image datasets, one altered automatically and the other manually by exploiting advanced AI-based image manipulation tools that are unknown at our training stage. We also explore the robustness of our method over an external dataset of other scientific images depicting different semantics, manipulated through unseen generation techniques.</description>

      <title>HABD: a houma alliance book ancient handwritten character recognition database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Houma Alliance Book, one of history's earliest calligraphic examples, was unearthed in the 1970s. These artifacts were meticulously organized, reproduced, and copied by the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics. However, because of their ancient origins and severe ink erosion, identifying characters in the Houma Alliance Book is challenging, necessitating the use of digital technology. In this paper, we propose a new ancient handwritten character recognition database for the Houma alliance book, along with a novel benchmark based on deep learning architectures. More specifically, a collection of 26,732 characters samples from the Houma Alliance Book were gathered, encompassing 327 different types of ancient characters through iterative annotation. Furthermore, benchmark algorithms were proposed by combining four deep neural network classifiers with two data augmentation methods. This research provides valuable resources and technical support for further studies on the Houma Alliance Book and other ancient characters. This contributes to our understanding of ancient culture and history, as well as the preservation and inheritance of humanity's cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>TSC-PCAC: Voxel Transformer and Sparse Convolution Based Point Cloud Attribute Compression for 3D Broadcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point cloud has been the mainstream representation for advanced 3D applications, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. However, the massive data amounts of point clouds is one of the most challenging issues for transmission and storage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end voxel Transformer and Sparse Convolution based Point Cloud Attribute Compression (TSC-PCAC) for 3D broadcasting. Firstly, we present a framework of the TSC-PCAC, which include Transformer and Sparse Convolutional Module (TSCM) based variational autoencoder and channel context module. Secondly, we propose a two-stage TSCM, where the first stage focuses on modeling local dependencies and feature representations of the point clouds, and the second stage captures global features through spatial and channel pooling encompassing larger receptive fields. This module effectively extracts global and local interpoint relevance to reduce informational redundancy. Thirdly, we design a TSCM based channel context module to exploit interchannel correlations, which improves the predicted probability distribution of quantized latent representations and thus reduces the bitrate. Experimental results indicate that the proposed TSC-PCAC method achieves an average of 38.53%, 21.30%, and 11.19% Bjontegaard Delta bitrate reductions compared to the Sparse-PCAC, NF-PCAC, and G-PCC v23 methods, respectively. The encoding/decoding time costs are reduced up to 97.68%/98.78% on average compared to the Sparse-PCAC. The source code and the trained models of the TSC-PCAC are available at https://github.com/igizuxo/TSC-PCAC.</description>

      <title>Attack on Scene Flow using Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13621v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in accurately estimating scene flow using point clouds, which is vital for many applications like video analysis, action recognition, and navigation. The robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants shows a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks. Code is available at https://github.com/aheldis/Attack-on-Scene-Flow-using-Point-Clouds.git.</description>

      <title>MaVEn: An Effective Multi-granularity Hybrid Visual Encoding Framework for Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents MaVEn, an innovative Multi-granularity Visual Encoding framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in multi-image reasoning. Current MLLMs primarily focus on single-image visual understanding, limiting their ability to interpret and integrate information across multiple images. MaVEn addresses this limitation by combining discrete visual symbol sequences, which abstract coarse-grained semantic concepts, with traditional continuous representation sequences that model fine-grained features. This dual approach bridges the semantic gap between visual and textual data, thereby improving the model's ability to process and interpret information from multiple images effectively. Additionally, we design a dynamic reduction mechanism by for long-sequence continuous features to enhance multi-image processing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MaVEn significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding in complex multi-image scenarios, while also improving performance in single-image contexts.</description>
