      <title>Central operators on complex Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the centre of a Dedekind complete complex Banach lattice is a commutative $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra in the order unit norm. This implies that the order unit norm and the operator norm coincide. As an application of the latter, a Fuglede--Putnam--Rosenblum-type theorem is established. Under an extra condition on the underlying real Banach lattice, which is satisfied when it is order continuous, a spectral theorem is given for the centre of the complex Banach lattice as a whole and for an individual central operator. The ensuing functional calculus for an individual operator is applied to show that central operators have many spectral properties similar to those of normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces. For example, when the spectrum is countable every element is the sum of an order convergent series of eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap and stability for groups and non-local games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The word stable is used to describe a situation when mathematical objects that almost satisfy an equation are close to objects satisfying it exactly. We study operator-algebraic forms of stability for unitary representations of groups and quantum synchronous strategies for non-local games. We observe in particular that simple spectral gap estimates can lead to strong quantitative forms of stability. For example, we prove that the direct product of two (flexibly) Hilbert-Schmidt stable groups is again (flexibly) Hilbert-Schmidt stable, provided that one of them has Kazhdan's property (T). We also provide a simple form and simple analysis of a non-local game with few questions, with the property that synchronous strategies with large value are close to perfect strategies involving large Pauli matrices. This simplifies one of the steps (the question reduction) in the recent announced resolution of Connes' embedding problem by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen.</description>

      <title>Homology and K-theory for self-similar actions of groups and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nekrashevych associated to each self-similar group action an ample groupoid and a $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra. We perform complete computations of the homology of the groupoid and the K-theory of the $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra for a myriad of examples, including the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk--Erschler group, Gupta--Sidki groups, and self-similar actions of free abelian groups and lamplighter groups. The key development is the construction, for arbitrary self-similar group actions, of long exact sequences which compute the homology and K-theory in terms of the homology of the group and K-theory of the group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra via the transfer map and the virtual endomorphism. Results are proved more generally for self-similar groupoids. As a consequence of our results and recent results of X.~Li, we are able to show that R\"over's simple group containing the Grigorchuk group and Thompson's group $V$ is rationally acyclic but has nontrivial Schur multiplier. We prove many more R\"over--Nekrashevych groups of self-similar groups are rationally acyclic.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Dimension and Rigidity Results for Virtually Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finitely generated virtually abelian group. We show that the Hirsch length, $h(G)$, is equal to the nuclear dimension of its group $C^*$-algebra, $\dim_{nuc}(C^*(G))$. We then specialize our attention to a generalization of crystallographic groups dubbed \textit{crystal-like}. We demonstrate that in this scenario a \textit{point group} is well defined and the order of this point group is preserved by $C^*$-isomorphism. We close by using these tools to demonstrate that crystallographic (as a group property) is preserved by $C^*$-isomorphism. These three tools combine to prove that $2D$ crystallographic groups are $C^*$-superrigid.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional model spaces invariant under composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional model spaces are quotient spaces of the Hardy space on the open unit disc, determined by finite Blaschke products. Composition operators, on the other hand, act by composing Hardy space functions with analytic self-maps of the open unit disc. Both are classical and well-studied objects in the theory of analytic function spaces. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of finite-dimensional model spaces that are invariant under composition operators. Finite cyclic groups and the prime factorizations of natural numbers play a crucial role in understanding the structure of such invariant subspaces and the associated analytic self-maps.</description>
