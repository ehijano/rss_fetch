      <title>Do White Dwarfs Sample Water-Rich Planetary Material?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polluted white dwarfs offer a unique way to directly probe the compositions of exoplanetary bodies. We examine the water content of accreted material using the oxygen abundances of 51 highly polluted white dwarfs. Within this sample, we present new abundances for three H-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that showed promise for accreting water-rich material. Throughout, we explore the impact of the observed phase and lifetime of accretion disks on the inferred elemental abundances of the parent bodies that pollute each white dwarf. Our results indicate that white dwarfs sample a range of dry to water-rich material, with median uncertainties in water mass fractions of $\approx$15\%. Amongst the He-dominated white dwarfs, 35/39 water abundances are consistent with corresponding H abundances. While for any individual white dwarf it may be ambiguous as to whether or not water is present in the accreted parent body, when considered as a population the prevalence of water-rich bodies is statistically robust. The population as a whole has a median water mass fraction of $\approx$25\%, and enforcing chondritic parent body compositions, we find that 31/51 WDs are likely to have non-zero water concentrations. This conclusion is different from a similar previous analysis of white dwarf pollution and we discuss reasons why this might be the case. Pollution in H-dominated white dwarfs continues to be more water-poor than in their He-dominated cousins, although the sample size of H-dominated white dwarfs remains small and the two samples still suffer a disjunction in the range of host star temperatures being probed.</description>

      <title>Aerosol dynamics on hot exoplanets: the role of radiation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosols appear to be ubiquitous in exoplanetary atmospheres. However because our understanding of the physical processes that govern aerosols is incomplete, their presence makes the measurement of atmospheric properties, such as molecular abundance ratios, difficult. We show that aerosol particles in highly-irradiated exoplanets experience an additional acceleration due to stellar radiation pressure. The strength of this radiative acceleration often exceeds the planet's gravity and can approach values of ~10-20x gravity's for low-density planets (typically sub-Saturns) hosting ~0.1--1 micron aerosols. Since these highly irradiated, low-density planets are often the best targets for atmospheric characterisation with current instrumentation, radiation pressure is likely an important process when considering aerosol dynamics. We find that radiation pressure accelerates hazes produced by photochemistry at high altitudes to faster terminal velocities, causing them to grow more slowly. Hence, the particles are smaller and have lower mass concentrations in the presence of radiation pressure. By simulating haze-like aerosols in a 2D equatorial band model, we show that radiation pressure steepens optical slopes in transmission spectra, resulting in less muted molecular features in the Near-IR and gives rise to a correlation between the strength of radiation pressure and the molecular feature amplitude. Furthermore, the interaction of zonal winds and radiation pressure impacts both the optical slopes and amplitudes on the individual morning and evening terminators.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tide modified Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.</description>

      <title>The Ongoing Decline in Activity of Comet 103P/Hartley 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report photometric observations of Comet 103P/Hartley 2 during its 2023 apparition. Our campaign, conducted from August through December 2023, combined data from a global network of citizen astronomers coordinated by Unistellar and the Association Fran\c{c}aise d'Astronomie. Photometry was derived using an automated pipeline for eVscope observations in partnership with the SETI Institute and aperture photometry via AstroLab Stellar. We find that the comet's peak reduced brightness, measured at $G_{\rm min} = 10.24 \pm 0.47$, continues a long-term fading trend since 1991. The decline in activity follows a per-apparition minimum magnitude increase of $\Delta G_{\rm min} = 0.59 \pm 0.11$ mag, corresponding to an approximately $42\%$ reduction in brightness each return. This trend implies that the comet's active fraction has declined by about an order of magnitude since 1991 and may indicate that Hartley 2 is no longer hyperactive by definition. The fading is consistent with progressive volatile depletion rather than orbital effects. These results offer insight into the evolutionary processes shaping Jupiter-family comets.</description>

      <title>The impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity on giant planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminosities of pre-main sequence stars evolve during the protoplanetary disc lifetime. This has a significant impact on the heating of their surrounding protoplanetary disks, the natal environments of planets. Moreover, stars of different masses evolve differently. However, this is rarely accounted for in planet formation models. We carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet formation modelling with focus on the impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity evolution on giant planet formation around host stars in the range of $1{-}2.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that giant planet formation is sensitive to the evolution of stellar luminosity, specifically the locations and times at which giant planet formation can occur depend on it. High stellar luminosity causes an increase in the scale height of the gas and pebbles, which may decrease the efficiency of pebble accretion, making it more challenging to form giant planets. This has important consequences for the composition of these giant planets, stressing the need to incorporate such aspects into planet formation models.</description>

      <title>Probing the extent of WASP-52 b's atmosphere. High-resolution observations and 3D modeling insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-52 b is an inflated hot Jupiter with a large Roche lobe filling fraction, positioned in the hot Neptune desert. Previous in-transit observations of the helium triplet at 10833 A have reported a range of excess absorption values (1.5%-5.5%) and a lack of net blueshift relative to the planet's rest frame, distinguishing it from other escaping atmospheres. This study investigates the extent and morphology of material escaping from WASP-52 b, assessing whether its outflow resembles a stream-like structure, as suggested for HAT-P-67 b and HAT-P-32 b. We obtained high-resolution spectra with CRIRES+ and CARMENES, covering a broader orbital phase range ($\varphi \approx \pm0.1, \pm0.2, 0.5$) than previous studies. By analyzing the He I 10833 A line as a tracer of escape, we search for extended absorption beyond transit. Additionally, we explore possible outflow morphologies with three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with an improved radiative transfer approach, assessing the He I 10833 A triplet. The helium line shows no significant evidence of planetary material at the orbital phases observed in this work, though 3D modeling suggests such a structure could exist below observational detection limits. We conclude that the atmospheric outflow of WASP-52 b can be characterized by an intermediate hydrodynamic escape parameter, placing it in a transitional regime between cold outflows forming a stream-like morphology and hot outflows forming a tail. Additionally, the absence of a detectable in-transit blueshift in the helium line rules out a strong day-to-nightside anisotropy scenario.</description>

      <title>Update of the CODE catalogue and some aspects of the dynamical status of Oort Cloud comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D distribution of orbital elements. Methods. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion, using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainties estimation and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations according to the latest data and algorithms. Results. This update of the CODE catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using current stellar data, we formulate new constraints for dynamically new comets. Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000 au and discovered before 2022, as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10 au from the Sun during during this period, and over 80% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7 au.</description>

      <title>Prediction of sulphate hazes in the lower Venus atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the amount, size distribution and material composition of (sub-)mic aerosol particles in the lower Venus atmosphere &lt; 50 km. Our GGchem phase-equilibrium model predicts metal-chloride and metal-fluoride molecules to be present in the gas over the Venus surface in trace concentrations &lt; 2.E-12, in particular FeCl2, NaCl, KCl and SiF4. Using an improved version of the DiffuDrift model developed by Woitke et al.2020, we find that these molecules deposit to form solid potassium sulphate K2SO4, sodium sulphate Na2SO4, and pyrite FeS2 above about 15.5 km, 9.5 km and 2.4 km, respectively. These heights coincide well with the three potential haze layers found in the Pioneer Venus Large Probe neutral mass spectrometer data by Mogul et al.2023. The particles with radius &lt; 0.3 mic can be dredged up from the ground to reach the sulphuric acid cloud base from below by diffusion. The particle density decreases from ~ 5000/cm3 at ground level to ~100/cm3 at a height of 45 km. Particles larger than about 1 mic are found to stay confined to the ground &lt; 10 km, indicating that the larger, so-called mode 3 particles, if they exist, cannot originate from the surface. All particles are expected to be coated by a thin layer of FeS2, Na2SO4 and K2SO4. We have included the repelling effect of particle charges on the coagulation, without which the model would predict much too steep gradients close to the surface, which is inconsistent with measured opacity data. Our models suggest that the particles must have at least 100 negative charges per micron of particle radius at ground level, and &gt; 50/mic at a height of 45 km.</description>

      <title>High-resolution models of the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1.
  Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence.
  Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Modelling magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M dwarfs Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti and GJ 1151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unambiguous detection of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) via radio observations would provide a novel method for detecting exoplanets and probing their magnetic fields. Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is hindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfv\'enic SPI predict that Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce detectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio emission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio detections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and Radio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission from sub-Alfv\'enic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic systems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature. Our results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the putative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime (assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We find that the Alfv\'en wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio emission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection are significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a relevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti. Our SIRIO code can also be used to evaluate the feasibility of radio proposals aimed at detecting SPI, and to constrain the stellar wind mass-loss rate or planetary magnetic field.</description>

      <title>VIPER: A high-resolution multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph concept for characterizing exoplanet atmospheric escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of applications in exoplanetary science require spectrographs with high resolution and high throughput without the need for a broad spectral range. Examples include the search for biosignatures through the detection of the oxygen A-band at 760 nm, and the study of atmospheric escape through the helium 1083 nm triplet. These applications align well with the capabilities of a spectrograph based on a Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA), a high-throughput dispersive element that is essentially a modified Fabry-Perot etalon. We are developing VIPER, a high-resolution, narrowband, multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph specifically designed to observe the helium 1083 nm triplet absorption line in the atmospheres of gaseous exoplanets. VIPER will achieve a resolving power of 300,000 over a wavelength range of 25 nm, and will be cross-dispersed by an echelle grating. VIPER is intended for operation on the 1.5 m Tillinghast Telescope and potentially on the 6.5 m MMT, both located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, USA. In this paper, we present VIPER's instrument requirements, derived from the primary science goal of detecting anisotropic atmospheric escape from exoplanets. We discuss the design methodology for VIPA-based spectrographs aimed at maximizing throughput and diffraction efficiency, and we derive a wave-optics-based end-to-end model of the spectrograph to simulate the intensity distribution at the detector. We present an optical design for VIPER and highlight the potential of VIPA-based spectrographs for advancing exoplanetary science.</description>

Abstract: We present CONAN (COde for exoplaNet ANalysis), an open-source Python package for comprehensive analyses of exoplanetary systems. It provides a unified Bayesian framework to simultaneously analyze diverse exoplanet datasets to derive global system parameters. CONAN allows to consistently model photometric transit light curves, occultations, phase curves, and radial velocity measurements, while detrending each dataset with any combination of parametric, sinusoidal, Gaussian Processes, and spline models.</description>

      <title>Optimized Observation Sequencing in Low-Earth Orbit with the SPHEREx Survey Planning Software</title>

Abstract: SPHEREx is a NASA infrared astronomy mission that launched on March 12th, 2025 and is operating successfully in low-Earth orbit (LEO). The mission is currently observing the entire sky in 102 spectral channels in four independent all-sky surveys and also achieves enhanced coverage in two deep fields. This data will resolve key science questions about the early universe, galaxy formation, and the origin of water and biogenic molecules. In this paper, we describe the survey planning software (SPS) that enables SPHEREx to observe efficiently while mitigating a range of operational challenges in LEO. Our optimal target selection algorithm achieves the required high coverage in both the All-Sky and Deep Surveys. The algorithm plans observations to stay within our time-varying allowable pointing zone, interleaves required data downlink passes, and mitigates outages due to the South Atlantic Anomaly and other events. As demonstrated by the sky coverage achieved in the first SPHEREx public data release, our approach is performing well in flight. The SPHEREx SPS is a key new capability that enables the mission to deliver groundbreaking science from LEO.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of giant exoplanets: Observational implications of convective mixing</title>

Abstract: The connection between the atmospheric composition of giant planets and their origin remains elusive. In this study, we explore how convective mixing can link the primordial planetary state to its atmospheric composition. We simulate the long-term evolution of gas giants with masses between 0.3 and 3 Jupiter masses, considering various composition profiles and primordial entropies (assuming no entropy-mass dependence). Our results show that when convective mixing is considered, the atmospheric metallicity increases with time and that this time evolution encodes information about the primordial planetary structure. Additionally, the degree of compositional mixing affects the planetary radius, altering its evolution in a measurable way. By applying mock observations, we demonstrate that combining radius and atmospheric composition can help to constrain the planetary formation history. Young systems emerge as prime targets for such characterization, with lower-mass gas giants (approaching Saturn's mass) being particularly susceptible to mixing-induced changes. Our findings highlight convective mixing as a key mechanism for probing the primordial state of giant planets, offering new constraints on formation models and demonstrating that the conditions inside giant planets shortly after their formation are not necessarily erased over billions of years and can leave a lasting imprint on their evolution.</description>
