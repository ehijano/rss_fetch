      <title>Chaos synchronization: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a self-contained comprehensive review of the phenomenon of synchronization in dynamical systems, with a particular focus on chaotic systems in both continuous-time and discrete-time contexts. Synchronization, initially observed by Christiaan Huygens in 1665, has evolved from the study of periodic signals to encompass chaotic systems, where the sensitive dependence on initial conditions poses unique challenges. This review pointed to both theoretical foundations and contributions (concepts and methods) and practical insights, reinforcing the relevance of chaos synchronization in physics, biology, engineering, social sciences, economics and communication systems. The study investigates various coupling schemes, such as unidirectional and bidirectional coupling, and presents stability criteria under different configurations. In a very concise way, some ongoing research carried out by the authors is also indicated, using Lorenz, Rossler and hyperchaotic Rossler systems, and quadratic maps as case studies with parameter values leading to chaotic behavior. Special attention is given to the stability of synchronized states and the role of multi-stability and bifurcations, and its implications to loss of synchronization. We highlight the role of Lyapunov exponents, eigenvalues, and Lyapunov functions in guaranteeing local and global stability of the synchronized state. We aim to contribute to a broader understanding of chaos synchronization and its practical applications in diverse fields of knowledge. This text shed light on the control and stability of coupled chaotic systems, offering new perspectives on the synchronization of non-identical systems and the emergence of complex synchronization dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian Kicked Rotor: Periodic forcing with finite-width pulses and the role of shifting the kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kicked Rotor is perhaps the simplest physical model to illuminate the transition from regular to chaotic motion in classical mechanics. It is also widely applied as a model of light-matter interactions. In the conventional treatment, the infinitesimal width of each kick allows an immediate integration of the equations of motion. This in turn allows a full description of the dynamics via a discrete mapping, the Standard Map, if one looks at the dynamics only stroboscopically. It turns out that this model is only part of a much richer story if one accounts for finite temporal width of the kick. In this letter, we formulate a general model of finite-width periodic forcing and derive a continuous set of maps that depend on a parameter shift $\Delta$ that allows one to capture the motion in both the driven and kicked regimes. The fixed points and symmetry of the mapping are shown analytically and numerically to depend on the value of the shift parameter.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Proliferation of Relativistic Domain Walls for Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic domain walls in antiferromagnets have been proposed as key components for faster conventional information processing, thanks to their enhanced stability and ultrafast propagation. However, how non-conventional computing methods like reservoir computing might take advantage of these properties remains an open question. In this work, we show how complex domain wall patterns can form through the proliferation of multiple domain walls from the energy stored in a single seed domain wall driven to move at a high speed close to the relativistic limit. We demonstrate that the resulting magnetic texture, consisting of up to hundreds of domain walls with an overall conserved topological charge as the initial seed domain wall, can possess chaotic spatiotemporal dynamics depending on the strength of staggered spin-orbit field induced via applied current. These findings allow us to design a multiple-domain-wall reservoir with high short-term memory and nonlinearity with respect to spin-orbit field inputs, that is suitable for ultrafast, energy-efficient, non-conventional reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have periodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points and bifurcation points and draw asymptotic bifurcation diagrams. Recently derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points contain coefficients defined as slowly converging infinite sums. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps.</description>

      <title>Control of spatiotemporal chaos by stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how spatiotemporal chaos in dynamical systems can be controlled by stochastically returning them to their initial conditions. Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings offer insights applicable to a broad class of extended classical interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Chaos-Driven Quantum State Discrimination Near Unit Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing quantum states becomes exponentially difficult as their fidelity approaches unity, with diminishing success probabilities. This study revisits chaotic dynamics, leveraging their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions for rapid amplification of state discrimination measures. The discrete-time chaotic evolution of qubit states is generated via iterative application of a nonlinear conformal map on the Julia set. The "quantum microscope" is characterized by a magnification power quantified through a temporal Bell-type inequality. Fixed points of the conformal map are shown to dictate optimal measurement operators, enabling (a) well-defined magnification power and (b) bounded Bell-type inequality values, providing a device-independent framework for self-testing the microscopes performance.</description>

      <title>Sparse chaos in cortical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nerve impulses, the currency of information flow in the brain, are generated by an instability of the neuronal membrane potential dynamics. Neuronal circuits exhibit collective chaos that appears essential for learning, memory, sensory processing, and motor control. However, the factors controlling the nature and intensity of collective chaos in neuronal circuits are not well understood. Here we use computational ergodic theory to demonstrate that basic features of nerve impulse generation profoundly affect collective chaos in neuronal circuits. Numerically exact calculations of Lyapunov spectra, Kolmogorov-Sinai-entropy, and upper and lower bounds on attractor dimension show that changes in nerve impulse generation in individual neurons moderately impact information encoding rates but qualitatively transform phase space structure. Specifically, we find a drastic reduction in the number of unstable manifolds, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and attractor dimension. Beyond a critical point, marked by the simultaneous breakdown of the diffusion approximation, a peak in the largest Lyapunov exponent, and a localization transition of the leading covariant Lyapunov vector, networks exhibit sparse chaos: prolonged periods of near stable dynamics interrupted by short bursts of intense chaos. Analysis of large, more realistically structured networks supports the generality of these findings. In cortical circuits, biophysical properties appear tuned to this regime of sparse chaos. Our results reveal a close link between fundamental aspects of single-neuron biophysics and the collective dynamics of cortical circuits, suggesting that nerve impulse generation mechanisms are adapted to enhance circuit controllability and information flow.</description>

      <title>Intermittent cluster synchronization in a unidirectional ring of bursting neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new mechanism through which extreme events with a dragon king-like distribution emerge in a network of unidirectional ring of Hindmarsh-Rose bursting neurons interacting through chemical synapses. We establish and substantiate the fact that depending on the choice of initial conditions, the neurons are divided into different clusters. These clusters transit from a phase-locked state (anti-phase) to phase synchronized regime with increasing value of the coupling strength. Before attaining phase synchronization, there exists some regions of the coupling strength where these clusters are phase synchronized intermittently. During such intermittent phase synchronization, extreme events originate in the mean-field of the membrane potential. This mechanism, which we name as intermittent cluster synchronization, is proposed as the new precursor for the generation of emergent extreme events in this system. These results are also true for diffusive coupling (gap junctions). The distribution of the local maxima of the collective observable shows a long tailed non-Gaussian while the interevent interval follows the Weibull distribution. The goodness of fit are corroborated using probability-probability plot and quantile-quantile plot. This intermittent phase synchronization becomes rarer and rarer with the increase in the number of clusters of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust methods to detect coupling among nonlinear time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two numerical methods are proposed for detection of coupling between multiple time series generated by deterministic nonlinear systems. The first detects interdependence or the existence of coupling between time series. The second ascertains directionality of coupling, or alternatively, latent coupling, the case when multiple series are driven by another, unobserved system. In either case, the driver and the recipients of the coupling may be periodic or aperiodic, and in particular may be chaotic. The only inputs to the method are two or more simultaneously recorded time series. The methods rely solely on ranking distances between states in time-delay reconstructions of the data, and for that reason tend to be robust to observational noise.</description>

      <title>Accurate modeling of continuous-time SAT solvers in SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing dynamical systems as solvers of NP-complete problems. In this paper, we present accurate implementations of two continuous-time dynamical solvers, known in the literature as analog SAT and digital memcomputing, using advanced numerical integration algorithms of SPICE circuit simulators. For this purpose, we have developed Python scripts that convert Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems into electronic circuits representing the analog SAT and digital memcomputing dynamical systems. Our Python scripts process conjunctive normal form (CNF) files and create netlists that can be directly imported into LTspice. We explore the SPICE implementations of analog SAT and digital memcomputing solvers by applying these to a selected set of problems and present some interesting and potentially useful findings related to digital memcomputing and analog SAT. In this work, we also introduce networks of continuous-time solvers with potential applications extending beyond the solution of Boolean satisfiability problems.</description>
