      <title>Quantum entropy as a harbinger of factorizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is a powerful probe for investigating the QCD structure of hadronic matter and testing the standard model (SM). DIS can be described through QCD factorization theorems which separate contributions to the scattering interaction arising from disparate scales - e.g., with nonperturbative matrix elements associated with long distances and a perturbative hard scattering kernel applying to short-distance parton-level interactions. The fundamental underpinnings of factorization may be recast in the quantum-theoretic terms of entanglement, (de)coherence, and system localization in a fashion which sheds complementary light on the dynamics at work in DIS from QCD bound states. In this Letter, we propose and quantitatively test such a quantum-information theoretic approach for dissecting factorization in DIS and its domain of validity; we employ metrics associated with quantum entanglement such as a differential quantum entropy and associated KL divergences in numerical tests. We deploy these methods on an archetypal quark-spectator model of the proton, for which we monitor quantum decoherence in DIS as underlying model parameters are varied. On this basis, we demonstrate quantitatively how factorization-breaking effects may be imprinted on quantum entropies in a kinematic regime where leading-twist factorization increasingly receives large corrections from finite-$Q^2$ effects; our findings suggest potential applications of quantum simulation to QCD systems and their interactions.</description>

      <title>Flavour and Electroweak Precision Constraints on a Simplified Dark Matter Model with a Light Spin-0 Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the allowed parameter spaces of a simplified dark matter (DM) model characterized by a spin-0 mediator with masses in the low to intermediate range ($ &lt; $ 10 GeV). We systematically divide the parameter space into various mass regions of the mediator and constrain the model parameters using a diverse set of observables, including flavour-changing charged and neutral current processes such as rare and semi-leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons (B and K), electroweak precision observables alongside data from fixed-target experiments. Additionally, we explore the model's capability to explain recent Belle-II data on invisible B-meson decays. Our study includes a detailed examination of DM properties and the constraints from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We present bounds on model parameters through individual and simultaneous analyses of the available inputs and highlight their implications for understanding DM phenomenology. Furthermore, we obtain the bound on the couplings of the possible gauge invariant dimension-5 operators, leading to the possible interactions between the spin-0 mediator and the SM gauge bosons and fermions. This study comprehensively investigates the constraints and theoretical implications associated with low-mass spin-0 mediator DM models.</description>

      <title>Supernova production of axion-like particles coupling to electrons, reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to electrons at tree-level in a relativistic plasma. We explicitly demonstrate the equivalence between pseudoscalar and derivative couplings, incorporate previously neglected processes for the first time-namely, semi-Compton production ($\gamma e^-\rightarrow a e^-$) and pair annihilation ($e^+e^-\rightarrow a\gamma$)-and derive analytical expressions for the bremsstrahlung ($e^- N\to e^- N a$) production rate, enabling a more computationally efficient evaluation of the ALP flux. Additionally, we assess uncertainties in the production rate arising from electron thermal mass corrections, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. The ALP emissivity is made available in a public repository as a function of the ALP mass, the temperature, and the electron chemical potential of the plasma. Finally, we examine the impact of ALP production and subsequent decays on astrophysical observables, deriving the leading bounds on ALPs coupling to electrons. At small couplings, the dominant constraints come from the previously neglected decay $a\to e^+ e^-\gamma$, except for a region of fireball formation where SN~1987A X-ray observations offer the best probe. At large couplings, bounds are dominated by the energy deposition argument, with a recently developed new prescription for the trapping regime.</description>

      <title>Charmonium content of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ in light-cone sum rules at twist 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize light-cone QCD sum rules at twist-3 accuracy to compute the coupling parameters of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ state with $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The analysis reveals that the observed $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ meson incorporates significant amounts of both charmonium and molecular components. Additionally, the interplay between these components highlights the exotic nature of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. Furthermore, implications for a possible mixing between a $\chi_{b1}(nP)$ state and a potential $B\bar{B}^*$ molecule is discussed. These findings contribute to the understanding of exotic hadron states and their intricate internal structures.</description>

      <title>Generic two-loop results for trilinear and quartic scalar self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the shape of the Higgs potential realised in Nature is a central part of the physics programme at the LHC and future colliders. In this context, accurate theoretical predictions for trilinear and quartic Higgs couplings are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present results that enable significant progress in the automation of these calculations at the two-loop level in a wide range of models. Specifically, we calculate the generic two-loop corrections for scalar n-point functions with n&lt;=4 assuming that all external scalars are identical. Working in the zero-momentum approximation, we express the results in terms of generic couplings and masses. Additionally, by exploiting permutation invariances, we reduce the number of Feynman diagrams appearing to a substantially smaller set of basis diagrams. To ease the application of our setup, we also provide routines that allow to map our generic results to scalar two-loop amplitudes generated with the package FeynArts. We perform a series of calculations to cross-check our results with existing results in the literature. Moreover, we present new two-loop results for the trilinear Higgs coupling in the general singlet extension of the Standard Model. We also present the public Python package Tintegrals, which allows for fast and stable evaluations of all relevant two-loop integrals with vanishing external momenta.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on Pion Fragmentation Functions from Simulated Electron-Ion Collider Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the anticipated impact of future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) measurements on the extraction of parton-to-pion fragmentation functions (FFs). Our analysis combines simulated semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) pseudo-data at EIC energies of 45 GeV and 140 GeV with existing single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation (SIA) and SIDIS experimental data. The pion fragmentation functions are determined at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy using a perturbative QCD framework and a neural network parametrization. Uncertainties are rigorously estimated through Monte Carlo sampling, accounting for both experimental errors and variations in input parton distribution functions. Our results demonstrate that while incorporating EIC pseudo-data has minimal impact on the central values of extracted FFs, it significantly reduces their uncertainties, especially at medium to large momentum fractions ($z$). This improvement is particularly pronounced for the gluon and selected quark FFs, highlighting the substantial role that EIC measurements will play in achieving high-precision extractions of FFs and informing future experimental and theoretical developments in collider physics.</description>

      <title>NLO corrections and factorization for transverse single-spin asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading order QCD corrections for the cross sections for $\ell p^\uparrow\to hX$, $\ell p^\uparrow\to {\mathrm{jet}}X$ with transversely polarized initial protons. These cross sections are known to be power-suppressed in QCD and probe twist-3 parton correlation functions in the proton. Our calculation exhibits the full complexity of a perturbative QCD analysis beyond leading power, involving in particular various derivatives of the parton correlation functions. We demonstrate that collinear factorization for these single-spin observables holds at one loop. We also present exploratory phenomenological results for the NLO single-spin asymmetry in $ep^\uparrow\to hX$ and compare to data from the HERMES experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the differential cross section for inclusive $\mathrm{D}^0$ production in ultraperipheral collisions within the Color Glass Condensate framework. Our predictions are found to be in relatively good agreement with the CMS data at small transverse momentum, which is the region of validity of our approach. Furthermore, we quantify saturation effects by a nuclear modification ratio $R_{pA}$ for $\mathrm{D}^0$ photoproduction and examine both analytically and numerically the collinear factorization limit of the $\mathrm{D}^0$ differential photoproduction cross section.</description>

      <title>Transverse Nucleon Single-Spin Asymmetry for Single-Inclusive Hadron and Jet Production at NLO Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the single-spin asymmetry for the single-inclusive production of hadrons and jets in collisions of transversely polarized nucleons and unpolarized leptons, $\ell N^\uparrow \to (h\,\mathrm{or\,jet})X$. We compute the spin-dependent cross section within collinear twist-3 factorization in perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. In this approach, multiparton correlations generate a non-vanishing effect. For the present paper, we focus on correlations in the nucleon initial-state rather than in the fragmentation process. We explicitly verify that collinear twist-3 factorization is valid at the one-loop level. Our analytical results show that at NLO the relevant multiparton correlation functions in the nucleon are probed on their full support in momentum fractions. Our numerical analysis for collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider indicates that the NLO corrections can be large and are sensitive to the functional form of the twist-3 correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Effects of tau-neutrino detection on non-standard interactions at DUNE with a short discussion on the nature of neutrino mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ detection at the DUNE far detector on the experiment's sensitivity to Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) in neutrino propagation. We show that the strongest observable NSI effect in the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance probabilities arises from $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$. We have studied the hierarchy sensitivity, CP violation sensitivity and octant sensitivity of DUNE from $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance channels in presence of NSI. We have also studied the detection sensitivity of NSI phases and the future constaints on NSI parameters from the tau neutrino appearance channels in DUNE. Additionally, we examine the role of $\nu_\tau$ detection in constraining the unitary nature of the PMNS matrix. These studies emphasize the importance of incorporating $\nu_\tau$ detection in long-baseline neutrino experiments such as DUNE.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the sea: universality of the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we demonstrate that back-to-back dijet correlations in dilute-dense collisions involving a small-$x$ quark from the nuclear target can be factorised in terms of universal transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) for the sea quarks. Two building blocks are needed to construct all these TMDs at the operator level: the sea quark TMD operator which appears in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) or in the Drell-Yan process and the elastic $S$-matrix for a quark-antiquark dipole. Compared to SIDIS, the saturation effects are stronger for dijet production in forward proton-nucleus collisions, due to additional scattering in the initial and final state, effectively resulting in a larger value for the nuclear saturation momentum.</description>

      <title>Emerging Excess Consistent with a Narrow Resonance at 152 GeV in High-Energy Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs boson discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN confirmed the existence of the last missing particle of the Standard Model (SM). The existence of new fundamental constituents of matter beyond the SM is of great importance for our understanding of Nature. In this context, indirect (non-resonant) indications for new scalar bosons were found in the data from the first run of the LHC, taken between 2010 and 2012 at CERN: an excess in the invariant mass of muon-electron pairs, consistent with a new Higgs boson ($S$) with a mass of $150\pm5$ GeV. Other processes with multiple leptons in the final state, moderate missing energy, and possibly (bottom quark) jets exhibit deviations from the SM predictions. These anomalies can be explained within a simplified model in which a new heavy Higgs boson $H$ decays into two lighter Higgses $S$. This lighter Higgs $S$ subsequently decays to $W$ bosons, bottom quarks and has also an invisible decay mode.
  Here, we demonstrate that using this model we can identify narrow excesses in di-photon and $Z$-photon spectra around 152 GeV. By incorporating the latest measurements of di-photons in association with leptons, we obtain a combined global significance of $5.4\sigma$. This represents the highest significance ever reported for an excess consistent with a narrow resonance beyond the SM (BSM) in high-energy proton-proton collision data at the LHC. Such findings have the potential to usher in a new era in particle physics - the BSM epoch - offering crucial insights into unresolved puzzles of nature.</description>

      <title>Lepton number violating/conserving heavy baryons four-body decays, in presence of two almost degenerated heavy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the four-body heavy baryon decay, including two leptons in the final state, of the form $B_A \to B_B P \ell_\alpha \ell_\beta$, which can be either a lepton number conserving (LNC) or a lepton number violating (LNV) process (where $B$, $P$ and $\ell$ are baryons, pseudoscalar mesons and leptons, respectively), including all kinematic allowed lepton pair possibilities. We work beyond the simplified assumption of a single heavy Majorana neutrino mixing with the active sector, considering potential interference effects when including two nearly degenerate heavy Majorana neutrinos. Particularly, we provide a first estimate of the decay channels involving different flavors for the external leptons (e.g., muon-tau), and elaborate on the interference pattern due to leptons exchange. We show that the results for the two heavy almost degenerate neutrinos can be recast into a single Majorana neutrino, and exhibit the features for both the LNC and LNV scenarios. We determine the potential exclusion region for the mass and heavy-light mixing parameters, of the neutrinos driving the decay, including finite size detector effects. We also obtain the Branching ratio as a function of the heavy neutrino mass for the current upper limit of the heavy-light mixings.</description>

Abstract: This work explores how assumptions regarding the particle-physics nature of dark matter can alter the evolution of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy and its expansive stellar stream. We run a large suite of $N$-body simulations to model the infall of a Sgr-like dwarf, exploring how the presence of dark matter self interactions impacts its evolution. For a scattering cross section of $\sigma/m_\chi = 30 \text{ cm}^2\text{/g}$ (at orbital velocity scales), these interactions result in significantly less stellar mass and little to no dark matter bound to the progenitor at the present day. To isolate the cause of this mass loss, we introduce a novel technique for controlling which pairs of dark matter simulation particles can interact. This enables us to identify ram-pressure evaporation - the scattering of satellite and host dark matter particles - as the primary source of the enhanced mass loss. The rapid disintegration of the Sgr progenitor when self interactions are allowed alters some key properties of the resulting stellar stream, most dramatically suppressing the presence of a "spur" on the apocenter of the trailing stream arm that correlates with the mass of the satellite at last pericenter. We demonstrate how the effects on the Sgr system scale with the particular choice of self-interaction cross section, which affects the degree of ram-pressure evaporation. These findings generalize beyond the Sgr system, underscoring that dwarf stellar streams and dwarf galaxies with close passages may serve as sensitive probes for dark matter self interactions.</description>

      <title>Stronger Constraints on Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Derived from the Thermal Evolution of the Intergalactic Medium over the Last Twelve Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15595</link>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been explored as potential dark matter candidates, with various astrophysical observations placing upper limits on the fraction $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ of dark matter in the form of PBHs. However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}\unicode{x2013}10^{17}$ g. Specifically, for $M_\mathrm{PBH} = 10^{16}$ g, we find $f_\mathrm{PBH} &lt; 5 \times 10^{-5}$ at 95% confidence, with the bound scaling approximately as $M_\mathrm{PBH}^{4}$ at other masses. Our inclusion of helium reionization and low-redshift temperature measurements strengthens previous IGM-based PBH constraints by an order of magnitude or more. Compared to other existing limits, our result is among the strongest, second only to the constraints from the 511 keV line from the Galactic Centre, but with distinct systematics. More broadly, this study highlights the IGM thermal history as a powerful and independent probe of beyond-standard-model physics.</description>

      <title>A low-redshift preference for an interacting dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an interacting dark sector model in trace-free Einstein gravity where dark energy has a constant equation of state, $w=-1$, and the energy-momentum transfer potential is proportional to the cold dark matter density. Compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, this scenario introduces a single additional dimensionless parameter, $\epsilon$, which determines the amplitude of the transfer potential. Using a combination of \textit{Planck} 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), DESI 2024 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data, we derive stringent constraints on the interaction, finding $\epsilon$ to be of the order of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$. While CMB and SNIa data alone do not favor the presence of such an interaction, the inclusion of DESI data introduces a mild $1\sigma$ preference for an energy-momentum transfer from dark matter to dark energy. This preference is primarily driven by low-redshift DESI BAO measurements, which favor a slightly lower total matter density $\Omega_m$ compared to CMB constraints. Although the interaction remains weak and does not significantly alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, our results highlight the potential role of dark sector interactions in late-time cosmology.</description>

      <title>Search for the radiative leptonic decay $D^+\to\gamma e^+\nu_e$ with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using 20.3$~\rm fb^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773$~\rm GeV$ with the BESIII detector, we report an improved search for the radiative leptonic decay $D^+\to\gamma e^+\nu_e$. An upper limit on its partial branching fraction for photon energies $E_\gamma&gt;10~\rm MeV$ is determined to be $1.2\times10^{-5}$ at 90\% confidence level, which excludes most current theoretical predictions. A sophisticated deep learning approach with thorough validation, based on the Transformer architecture, is implemented to efficiently distinguish the signal from massive backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models for Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum protocol for efficiently learning and sampling multivariate probability distributions that commonly appear in high-energy physics. Our approach introduces a bivariate probabilistic model based on generalized Chebyshev polynomials, which is (pre-)trained as an explicit circuit-based model for two correlated variables, and sampled efficiently with the use of quantum Chebyshev transforms. As a key application, we study the fragmentation functions~(FFs) of charged pions and kaons from single-inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation. We learn the joint distribution for the momentum fraction $z$ and energy scale $Q$ in several fragmentation processes. Using the trained model, we infer the correlations between $z$ and $Q$ from the entanglement of the probabilistic model, noting that the developed energy-momentum correlations improve model performance. Furthermore, utilizing the generalization capabilities of the quantum Chebyshev model and extended register architecture, we perform a fine-grid multivariate sampling relevant for FF dataset augmentation. Our results highlight the growing potential of quantum generative modeling for addressing problems in scientific discovery and advancing data analysis in high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the study of higher-form-symmetries to theories with supersymmetry. Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weil symmetries whose generators are constructed using invariant differential forms in super-manifolds. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetries and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges. Notably, the charge is proportional to the super-linking number between the super-hypersurface supporting the symmetry generator and the one supporting the defect.</description>

      <title>On the finite basis of two-loop `t Hooft-Veltman Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the finite basis topologies of two-loop dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals in the `t Hooft-Veltman scheme in the Standard Model. We present a functionally distinct finite basis of Master Integrals which spans the whole transcendental space of all two-loop Feynman integrals with external momenta in four dimensions. We also indicate that all the two-loop Master Integrals, in an appropriate basis, with more than 8 denominators do not contribute to the finite part of any two-loop scattering amplitude. In addition, we elaborate on the application of the `t Hooft-Veltman decomposition to improve the performance of numerical evaluation of Feynman integrals using AMFlow and DCT packages. Moreover, we analyze the spectrum of special functions and the corresponding geometries appearing in any two-loop scattering amplitude. Our work will allow for a reduction in the computational complexity required for providing high-precision predictions for future high-multiplicity collider observables, both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants, long-range correlations, and the antiproton puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze joint factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and point out that they obey the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p\rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$ as a function of acceptance when only long-range correlations are present in the system, such as global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations. This hypothesis can be directly tested experimentally without the need for corrections for volume fluctuations. We show that if correlations among protons and antiprotons are driven by global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations only, the equality $\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2 = \hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2$ holds for large systems created in central collisions. We point out that the experimental data of the STAR Collaboration from phase I of RHIC beam energy scan are approximately consistent with the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p \rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$, but the normalized antiproton correlations are stronger than that of protons, $-\hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2 &gt; -\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2$, indicating that global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations alone cannot explain the data. We also discuss high-order factorial cumulants which can be measured with sufficient precision within phase II of RHIC-BES.</description>

      <title>Apparent $w&lt;-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$&lt;-1$ to a present-day value~$&gt;-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.</description>

Abstract: The novel constraint on any solution to QCD has been exactly and uniquely derived in the framework of the the Slavnov-Taylor identities for the gauge particles propagators. It has the two independent solutions. 1). The first one leads to the general QCD, possessing the confinement phase transition. 2).The second one leads to the particular QCD, or, equivalently, the conventional QCD, does not possessing it. The dynamical source of this effect has to be identified with the constant tadpole term, having the dimension of a mass squared, contributing to the full gluon self-energy. Its renormalized version is conventionally called a mass gap. By formulating the proper subtraction scheme, we prove that it cannot be disregarded from the theory and its ground state by any means, but the perturbative renormalizability of QCD will not be affected.The general QCD forbids the free gluons to appear in the physical spectrum at large distances, and, at the time, has an asymptotic freedom behaviour at high energies. Finally, we describe how our advance results are connected to the Jaffe-Witten's theorem.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic description of direct photon spectra and elliptic flow in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high energy heavy ion collisions a new state of matter, the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma is formed that exhibits the similar properties as our Universe had just a couple of microseconds after the Big Bang, hence such collisions are usually referred as Little Bangs. Subsequent investigations showed that the created medium is a nearly perfect fluid whose time evolution can be described by hydrodynamic models. The distribution of the hadrons that are created in the freeze-out after a rapid expansion carry information about the final state. On the other hand, with penetrating probes, e.g., with direct photons, one can model the time evolution of the quark gluon plasma. In this paper, we present a hydrodynamic model that was inspired by an analytical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics, calculate the invariant transverse momentum spectrum and the elliptic flow of direct photons and compare our results to LHC ALICE data to obtain the value of the model parameters. Based on the the results we give an estimation for the initial temperature of the plasma.</description>

      <title>ALPs and HNLs at LHC and Muon Colliders: Uncovering New Couplings and Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) and heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are two well-motivated classes of particles beyond the Standard Model. It is intriguing to explore the new detection opportunities that may arise if both particle types coexist. Part of the authors already investigated this scenario in a previous publication, within a simplified model containing an ALP and a single HNL, identifying particularly promising processes that could be searched for at the LHC. In this paper, we first consider the same setup with a broader range of both production processes and final states, both at the High-Luminosity LHC and at a future muon collider. Subsequently, we expand it to the more realistic scenario with at least two HNLs, necessary to describe the active neutrino masses. Different phenomenological signals are expected and we examine the complexities that emerge in this setup. This study paves the way for dedicated analysis at (forthcoming) colliders, potentially pinpointing the dynamics of ALPs and HNLs.</description>

      <title>Analysis on Neutrino Masses and Leptogenesis in the CP-Violating Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article investigates leptogenesis by extending the CP-violating Standard Model (CPVSM) from the quark sector to the lepton sector. Using two known neutrino mass-squared differences (MSDs), the third MSD and the absolute neutrino masses are predicted. These predictions constrain the possible ranges of neutrino masses and provide valuable guidance for designing future neutrino experiments. Additionally, by applying Jarlskog's CP-violation (CPV) measure $\Delta_{CP} \equiv~ J \cdot \Delta_{ij} \cdot \Delta_{jk} \cdot \Delta_{ki}$ (where $J$ is the Jarlskog invariant and $\Delta_{ij}$ represents mass-squared differences between generations), calculations reveal that leptogenesis in this framework is at least 71 orders of magnitude weaker than baryogenesis. This dramatic difference indicates that physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is needed if leptogenesis is expected to contribute significantly to the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU).</description>

      <title>On the origin of the peak of the sound velocity for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a system composed of strongly interacting matter with an isospin imbalance, using as an effective description of QCD the two-flavor Linear Sigma Model with quarks. From the one-loop effective potential, including the two light quarks, pions and sigma contributions, and enforcing the restrictions imposed by chiral symmetry, we show that the development of an isospin condensate comes together with the emergence of a Goldstone mode that provides a constraint for the chiral and isospin condensates as a result of a non-trivial mixing between the charged pions and the sigma. We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the peak of the sound velocity to the proper treatment of the Goldstone mode and to the non-trivial mixing of the charged pions and sigma in the isospin condensed phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions exhibit collective flow, which emerges as a dynamical response of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) to the initial state geometry of the collision. Collective flow in heavy-ion collisions is usually described within multi-stage evolution models, which employ a viscous relativistic hydrodynamic description of the space-time evolution of the QGP. By comparing event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory and viscous hydrodynamics in OO, AuAu and PbPb collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, we quantify to what extent a macroscopic hydrodynamic description can accurately describe the development of collective flow and to what extent collective flow in small systems, such as OO, is sensitive to the non-equilibrium evolution of the QGP beyond hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the first measurements of the same ion species in OO collisons at RHIC and LHC, we propose an observable to distinguish whether collective behavior builds up through a hydrodynamic expansion of a strongly interacting QGP or few final state re-scatterings. Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on anisotropic flow. We validate its ability to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Searching for MeV-mass neutrinophilic Dark Matter with Large Scale Dark Matter Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The indirect detection of dark matter (DM) through its annihilation products is one of the primary strategies for DM detection. One of the least constrained classes of models is neutrinophilic DM, because the annihilation products, weakly interacting neutrinos, are challenging to observe. Here, we consider a scenario where MeV-mass DM exclusively annihilates to the third neutrino mass eigenstate, which is predominantly of tau and muon flavor. In such a scenario, the potential detection rate of the neutrinos originating from the DM annihilation in our Galaxy in the conventional detectors would be suppressed by up to approximately two orders of magnitude. This is because the best sensitivity of such detectors for neutrinos with energies below approximately 100 MeV is for electron neutrino flavor. In this work, we highlight the potential of large-scale DM detectors in uncovering such signals in the tens of MeV range of DM masses. In addition, we discuss how coincident signals in direct detection DM experiments and upcoming neutrino detectors such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO could provide new perspectives on the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical catalysis constrained by LQCD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidences of vortical effects have been recently found by experiments in heavy ion collisions, instigating new insights into the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Considering the effect of rotations, lattice QCD data shows that the temperatures for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration should increase with real angular velocity, and the dominant effects are related to gluonic degrees of freedom. These findings could be essential for quark models in rotating systems that lack gluonic interactions, which predicts the decreasing of the chiral temperature transition with the angular velocity. To address this issue properly, in this work we apply the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to explore the phase diagram in a rotating rigid cylinder with constant angular velocity in the mean field approximation. To circumvent the absence of gluons, we propose the application of an effective coupling dependent of the angular velocity, fitted to match the pseudocritical temperature of chiral phase transition in the model through lattice QCD data. Our results indicate that the running coupling induces the enhancement of the chiral condensate as a function of angular velocity, strengthening the breaking of chiral symmetry, an effect previously dubbed as chiral vortical catalysis. For the chiral susceptibility we observe stronger fluctuations around the transition temperature when we consider the running coupling. The phase diagram is affected by these findings shifting the critical end point (CEP) to higher temperatures and chemical potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal short-distance constraints on hadronic light-by-light scattering and tensor meson contributions to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-distance constraints from the operator product expansion in QCD play an important role in the evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While conventional hadronic models involving a finite number of resonances fail to reproduce the correct power laws implied by them, holographic QCD has been shown to naturally incorporate the Melnikov-Vainshtein constraint on the longitudinal amplitude following from the triangle anomaly in the asymmetric limit, where one photon virtuality remains small compared to the others. This is saturated by an infinite tower of axial vector mesons, and their numerical contribution to the muon $g-2$ in AdS/QCD models agrees rather well with a recent dispersive analysis and alternative approaches. However, the longitudinal short-distance constraint where all virtualities are large turns out to be matched only at the level of 81\%. In this Letter we show that tensor mesons, whose contribution to the muon $g-2$ has recently been found to be underestimated, can fill this gap, because in holographic QCD their infinite tower of excited mesons only contributes to the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint. Numerically, they give rise to a sizeable positive contribution from the low-energy region below 1.5 GeV, a small one from the mixed region, and a negligible one from the high-energy region, which could explain the remaining gap between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for the complete hadronic light-by-light contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze vanishing cycles of Feynman loop integrals by means of the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence. A complete classification of possible vanishing geometries are obtained. We employ this result for establishing an asymptotic expansion for the loop integrals near their singularity locus, then give explicit formulas for the coefficients of such an expansion. The further development of this framework may potentially lead to exact calculations of one- and two-loop Feynman diagrams, as well as other next-to-leading and higher-order diagrams, in studies of radiative corrections for upcoming lepton-hadron scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal, fast, and robust inference of reionization-era cosmology with the 21cmPIE-INN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning will allow for simulation-based inference from reionization-era 21cm observations at the Square Kilometre Array. Our framework combines a convolutional summary network and a conditional invertible network through a physics-inspired latent representation. It allows for an efficient and extremely fast determination of the posteriors of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, jointly with well-calibrated and on average unbiased summaries. The sensitivity to non-Gaussian information makes our method a promising alternative to the established power spectra.</description>

      <title>The Born regime of gravitational amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $2 \to 2$ scattering in the regime where the wavelength of the scattered objects is comparable to their distance but is much larger than any Compton wavelength in the quantum field theory. We observe that in this regime - which differs from the eikonal - the Feynman diagram expansion takes the form of a geometric series, akin to the Born series of quantum mechanics. Conversely, we can define the Feynman diagram expansion as the Born series of a relativistic effective-one-body (EOB) Schr\"odinger equation. For a gravitational theory in this regime we observe that the EOB Schr\"odinger equation reduces to the Regge-Wheeler or Teukolsky wave equations. We make use of this understanding to study the tree-level Compton scattering off a Kerr black hole. We compute the scalar and photon Compton amplitude up to $O(a^{30})$ in the black hole spin $a$ and propose an all-order expression. Remarkably, we find that boundary terms, which are typically neglected, give non-zero contact pieces necessary for restoring crossing symmetry and gauge invariance of the Kerr-Compton amplitude.</description>

      <title>Qutrit and Qubit Circuits for Three-Flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Dark matter cooling during early matter-domination boosts sub-earth halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of an early matter-dominated epoch prior to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis may lead to a scenario where the thermal dark matter cools faster than plasma before the radiation-dominated era begins. In the radiation-dominated epoch, dark matter free-streams after it decouples both chemically and kinetically from the plasma. In the presence of an early matter-dominated era, chemical decoupling of the dark matter may succeed by a partial kinetic decoupling before reheating ends, depending upon the contributions of different partial wave amplitudes in the elastic scattering rate of the dark matter. We show that the s-wave scattering is sufficient to partially decouple the dark matter from the plasma, if the entropy injection during the reheating era depends on the bath temperature, while p-wave scattering leads to full decoupling in such cosmological backdrop. The decoupling of dark matter before the end of reheating causes an additional amount of cooling, reducing its free-streaming horizon compared to the usual radiation-dominated cosmology. The enhanced matter perturbations for scales entering the horizon prior to the end of reheating, combined with the reduced free-steaming horizon, increase the number density of sub-earth mass halos. The resulting boost in the dark matter annihilation signatures could offer an intriguing probe to differentiate pre-BBN non-standard cosmological epochs. We show that the free-streaming horizon of the dark matter requires to be smaller than a cut-off to ensure a boost in the sub-earth halo populations. As case studies we present two examples: one for a scalar dark matter with $s$-wave elastic scattering and the other one featuring a fermionic dark matter with $p$-wave elastic scattering. We identify regions of parameter space in both models where the dark matter kinetically decouples during reheating, amplifying small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang-Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang-Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang-Mills fields is defined. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, stabilise the chromo-magnetic vortices and dynamically induce, as non-trivial topological features, chiral symmetry-breaking. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation can be derived that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant and yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework allowing to make an explicit connection between the phenomenology of QCD, namely the properties of the gluon correlator and Wilson loops, and a particular relativistic model for the description of nuclear matter and neutron stars, the chiral confining model. Starting with the Field Correlator Method, which incorporates explicitly and simultaneously confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, we describe how to obtain the response of the composite nucleon to the nuclear scalar field, the relative role of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the in-medium nucleon mass evolution, generating the three-body forces needed for the saturation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD model for heavy and exotic mesons at finite density: A self-consistent dynamical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent dynamical holographic QCD model to investigate the mass spectra and melting behavior of heavy and exotic mesons at finite temperature and finite density. Our approach is based on the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework and incorporates an elsewhere already introduced, albeit by hand, phenomenological non-quadratic dilaton profile. This allows one to capture the non-linear Regge trajectories of heavy-flavor mesons and model certain exotic states. We show how to construct such models by actually solving the coupled Einstein, Maxwell, and dilaton field equations, ensuring mathematical self-consistency to replace any ad-hoc input. At finite temperature, we analyze the confinement-deconfinement transition via a Hawking-Page phase transition. We compute the spectral functions, revealing the sequential melting of quarkonia as the temperature is increased. Extending to finite density, we explore the impact of baryon chemical potential on meson stability, showing significant modifications in spectral peaks and effective potentials that indicate a more rapid melting of mesonic states as the chemical potential increases in the deconfined phase. The dual of the small/large black hole transition now indicates towards a first order phase transition line ending at a second order critical point. Interestingly, the spectral functions smoothly cross this phase transition line.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical understanding of deep learning remains elusive despite its empirical success. In this study, we propose a novel "synaptic field theory" that describes the training dynamics of synaptic weights and biases in the continuum limit. Unlike previous approaches, our framework treats synaptic weights and biases as fields and interprets their indices as spatial coordinates, with the training data acting as external sources. This perspective offers new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of deep learning and suggests a pathway for leveraging well-established field-theoretic techniques to study neural network training.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernova explosions hindered by eV-mass sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>
