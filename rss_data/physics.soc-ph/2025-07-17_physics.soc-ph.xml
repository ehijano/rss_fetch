      <title>Stochastic Dynamics of Ripple XRP for Cross-Border Settlement Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feasibility of XRP as a liquidity medium in cross-border transactions is assessed in this paper using a thorough stochastic framework. We use simulations of settlement latency, regime-switching volatility, and jump-diffusion models. The models are calibrated using historical data from public exchanges and RippleNet corridors, and they assess FX dynamics, liquidity depth, and tail risks in real-world scenarios. The behavior of XRP differs significantly from the conventional GBM assumptions, according to the results, and stochastic volatility with regime awareness provides a reliable path to corridor optimization. Our empirical validation shows that adding volatility feedback and routing adjustments significantly increases remittance success rates.</description>

      <title>La \'Ultima Frontera de La Filosof\'ia: Hacia una S\'intesis de La \'Etica del Futuro a Largo Plazo, el Riesgo Existencial y la Ontolog\'ia Posthumana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanity's unprecedented technological capacity and concurrent existential risks reveal a critical lacuna in the philosophical tradition: the absence of a systematic framework for the long-term future. This article argues that formulating such a framework is the central ethical imperative of our era. To defend this thesis, it synthesizes the normative ethics of Hans Jonas and Derek Parfit with the analytical framework of Nick Bostrom's work on existential risk and longtermism. The analysis further addresses the ontological challenge posed by posthumanism to the human 'subject' and explores the functional role of a secular cosmic purpose in motivating long-term action. The paper's main contribution is the articulation of a synthetic research agenda for a prospective philosophy, one that integrates axiology, risk management, and ontology to guide humanity through its perilous technological adolescence.</description>

      <title>Perception of Brain-Computer Interface Implantation Surgery for Motor, Sensory, and Autonomic Restoration in Spinal Cord Injury and Stroke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Stroke and SCI are conditions that can significantly impact the QoL of survivors in both the physical and psychosocial domains. Both diseases often result in significant motor and sensory impairments that are not fully reversible despite current available therapies. Invasive BCIs have emerged as a promising means to bypass the site of injury and potentially restore motor and sensory function. However, to maximize the utility and participant satisfaction with such technology, participants' willingness to embrace BCIs must be assessed, and placed in context with functional goals and rehabilitative priorities. Hence, we conducted a survey of a cohort of stroke (n=33), SCI (n=37), and both (n=1) participants regarding their receptiveness to invasive ECoG-based BCIs as well as to assess their goals for functional rehabilitation. Overall, participants indicated a high level of willingness to undergo surgery to implant ECoG grids for BCI technology if basic motor functions, including upper extremity, gait, bowel/bladder, and sensory function were restored. There was no correlation between participant willingness to undergo a prospective BCI implantation and the level of functional recovery offered by the BCI. Similarly, there was no correlation between willingness to undergo surgery and the participants' perceived rehabilitative priorities and level of disability. These findings indicate that participants were interested in invasive BCI technology even if only basic functions can be restored, regardless of their level of disability and their rehabilitative priorities. Such observations imply that first generation commercial invasive BCIs may not need extensive functions to garner adoption. Conversely, it also raises a concern that participants from the stroke and SCI cohort may be overly enthusiastic about such technology, which poses potential risks for medical exploitation.</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Physics-Informed Model for Predicting Extreme Conflict Fatalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of armed conflicts is expressed in the number of fatalities that may span several orders of magnitude. This study presents a minimalist, physics-informed approach to estimating the likelihood of extreme conflict fatalities at the country level of analysis using Bayesian modeling and energy-based dynamics. Leveraging the Boltzmann distribution to construct a Dirichlet prior, we formulate a predictive measure that captures the underlying entropy and energy states of conflict severity. By analyzing a dataset of 112 countries in conflict, we support the predictive power of the proposed measure. The findings suggest that extreme conflict events may be better understood through a minimal but theoretically grounded approach.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Delivery Mobility: A City-Scale, Path-Reconstructed Trajectory Dataset of Instant Delivery Riders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the on-demand economy has profoundly reshaped urban mobility and logistics, yet high-resolution trajectory data on delivery riders' consistent movements remains scarce. Here, we present a city-scale, high-resolution spatiotemporal trajectory dataset of on-demand instant delivery riders in Beijing. This dataset was produced through a path-reconstruction methodology applied to an open dataset containing delivery order information. Subsequently, detailed and continuous trajectories were reconstructed by simulating cycling routes via a major online map service to ensure they were realistically aligned. For validation, the reconstructed paths were compared against ground-truth travel metrics, revealing a strong correlation with actual travel patterns. The analysis yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 for route distance and 0.79 for route duration. This high fidelity ensures the dataset's utility for describing delivery riders' mobility. This publicly available resource offers unprecedented opportunities for researchers in urban planning, transportation studies, logistics optimization, and computational social science to investigate rider behavior, model urban freight systems, and develop more efficient and sustainable city-wide logistics solutions.</description>

      <title>Peer Review and the Diffusion of Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines a fundamental yet overlooked function of peer review: its role in exposing reviewers to new and unexpected ideas. Leveraging a natural experiment involving over half a million peer review invitations covering both accepted and rejected manuscripts, and integrating high-scale bibliographic and editorial records for 37,279 submitting authors, we find that exposure to a manuscript's core ideas significantly influences the future referencing behavior and knowledge of reviewer invitees who decline the review invite. Specifically, declining reviewer invitees who could view concise summaries of the manuscript's core ideas not only increase their citations to the manuscript itself but also demonstrate expanded breadth, depth, diversity, and prominence of citations to the submitting author's broader body of work. Overall, these results suggest peer review substantially influences the spread of scientific knowledge. Ironically, while the massive scale of peer review, entailing millions of reviews annually, often drives policy debates about its costs and burdens, our findings demonstrate that precisely because of this scale, peer review serves as a powerful yet previously unrecognized engine for idea diffusion, which is central to scientific advances and scholarly communication.</description>

      <title>Social polarization promoted by sparse higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many social interactions are group-based, yet their role in social polarization remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap here we introduce a higher-order framework that takes into account both group interactions and homophily. We find that group interactions can strongly enhance polarization in sparse systems by limiting agents' exposure to dissenting views. Conversely, they can suppress polarization in fully connected societies, an effect that intensifies as the group size increases. Our results highlight that polarization depends not only on the homophily strength but also on the structure and microscopic arrangement of group interactions.</description>

      <title>SETI Post-Detection Futures: Directions for Technosignature Research and Readiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This white paper highlights the work that is needed to anticipate the challenges and societal impacts of a possible technosignature detection. We recommend practical steps to strengthen NASA's astrobiology agenda, guided by the existing interdisciplinary framework of the SETI PostDetection Hub (est. 2022) at the University of St Andrews (Elliot et al. 2023), which emphasizes comprehensive preparedness across science, society, governance, and communication. NASA can significantly enhance readiness by supporting deep interdisciplinary integration, funding SETI post-detection research infrastructure, and cultivating international collaboration. We outline six key dimensions of readiness-directed evidence-based research: cross-divisional methodologies, humanities and social sciences integration, communication, strategic foresight, and development of resilient global infrastructures.</description>

      <title>A Cellular Automata Approach to Donation Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The donation game is a well-established framework for studying the emergence and evolution of cooperation in multi-agent systems. The cooperative behavior can be influenced by the environmental noise in partially observable settings and by the decision-making strategies of agents, which may incorporate not only reputation but also traits such as generosity and forgiveness. Traditional simulations often assume fully random interactions, where cooperation is tested between randomly selected agent pairs. In this paper, we investigate cooperation dynamics using the concept of Stephen Wolfram's one-dimensional binary cellular automata. This approach allows us to explore how cooperation evolves when interactions are limited to neighboring agents. We define binary cellular automata rules that conform to the donation game mechanics. Additionally, we introduce models of perceptual and action noise, along with a mutation matrix governing the probabilistic evolution of agent strategies. Our empirical results demonstrate that cooperation is significantly affected by agents' mobility and their spatial locality on the game board. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between entirely random multi-agent systems and those in which agents are more likely to interact with their nearest neighbors.</description>

      <title>Decoupling geographical constraints from human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by access to large volumes of movement data, the study of human mobility has grown rapidly over the past decades. The field has shown that human mobility is scale-free, proposed models to generate scale-free moving distance distributions, and explained how the scale-free distribution arises. It has not, however, explicitly addressed how mobility is structured by geographical constraints. How mobility relates to the outlines of landmasses, lakes, and rivers; by the placement of buildings, roadways, and cities. Based on millions of moves, we show how separating the effect of geography from mobility choices, reveals a power law spanning five orders of magnitude. To do so, we incorporate geography via the `pair distribution function' that encapsulates the structure of locations on which mobility occurs. Showing how the spatial distribution of human settlements shapes human mobility, our approach bridges the gap between distance- and opportunity-based models of human mobility.</description>

      <title>Negative Ties Highlight Hidden Extremes in Social Media Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05590v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human interactions in the online world comprise a combination of positive and negative exchanges. These diverse interactions can be captured using signed network representations, where edges take positive or negative weights to indicate the sentiment of the interaction between individuals. Signed networks offer valuable insights into online political polarization by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides on social media platforms. This study analyzes polarization on Meneame, a Spanish social media platform that facilitates engagement with news stories through comments and voting. Using a dual-method approach, Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks, we investigate how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization levels across different conversation topics on the platform. While the unsigned Meneame network effectively delineates ideological communities, only by incorporating negative ties can we identify ideologically extreme users who engage in antagonistic behaviors: without them, the most extreme users remain indistinguishable from their less confrontational ideological peers.</description>

      <title>Effective one-dimension reduction of multi-compartment complex systems dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broad class of systems, including ecological, epidemiological, and sociological ones, are characterized by populations of individuals assigned to specific categories, e.g., a chemical species, an opinion or an epidemic state, that are modeled as compartments. Due to interactions and intrinsic dynamics, individuals are allowed to change category, leading to concentrations varying over time with complex behavior, typical of reaction-diffusion systems. While compartmental modeling provides a powerful framework for studying the dynamics of such populations and describe the spatiotemporal evolution of a system, it mostly relies on deterministic mean-field descriptions to deal with systems with many degrees of freedom. Here, we propose a method to alleviate some of the limitations of compartmental models by capitalizing on tools originating from quantum physics to systematically reduce multi-dimensional systems to an effective one-dimensional representation. Using this reduced system, we are able to not only investigate the mean-field dynamics and their critical behavior, but we can additionally study stochastic representations that capture fundamental features of the system. We demonstrate the validity of our formalism by studying the critical behavior of models widely adopted to study epidemic, ecological and economic systems.</description>
