      <title>Dynamical topology of chiral and nonreciprocal state transfers in a non-Hermitian quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental concept underlying topological phenomena posits the geometric phase associated with eigenstates. In contrast to this prevailing notion, theoretical studies on time-varying Hamiltonians allow for a new type of topological phenomenon, known as topological dynamics, where the evolution process allows a hidden topological invariant associated with continuous flows. To validate this conjecture, we study topological chiral and nonreciprocal dynamics by encircling the exceptional points (EPs) of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in a trapped ion system. These dynamics are topologically robust against external perturbations even in the presence dissipation-induced nonadiabatic processes. Our findings indicate that they are protected by dynamical vorticity -- an emerging topological invariant associated with the energy dispersion of non-Hermitian band structures in a parallel transported eigenbasis. The symmetry breaking and other key features of topological dynamics are directly observed through quantum state tomography. Our results mark a significant step towards exploring topological properties of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optical contrast-based determination of number of layers for two-dimensional van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20938</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in revealing intrinsic magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials have highlighted their potential for future spintronic applications, driven by their novel physical properties, promising for future spintronic devices. In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\,cm$^-1$ \&amp; 190\,cm$^-1$. Both modes show the intensity dependence on the thickness of FGT, same as out-of-plane (A$_{1g}$) Raman modes.</description>

      <title>The 2/3 Rule of Glass Physics Implies Universalities in Crystal Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since more than 100 years, melting is thought to be governed by the Lindemann criterion. It assumes that a crystal melts when, upon heating, the growing atomic vibration amplitudes become sufficiently large to destabilize its crystalline lattice. However, it is unclear why the viscosities eta or the related relaxation times tau of the resulting liquids, measured directly at the melting point Tm, differ by up to nine decades, depending on the material. Based on the empirical rule that the ratio of the glass-transition temperature and Tm is about 2/3, here we show that this strong variation is due to differences in the liquid's fragilities, a property associated with pronounced non-Arrhenius behavior and often ascribed to cooperative motions. We propose that, without cooperativity, all crystals would melt into liquids with a universal viscosity value and relaxation time. Hence, the real melting point is only partly determined by the Lindemann criterion and strongly enhanced by the cooperativity of the resulting liquid. Our findings are corroborated by the determination of the idealized, fragility-free melting temperatures, and of the corresponding eta and tau values for various example materials.</description>

      <title>The derivation of the Liouville equation from the Schrodinger equation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new way of deriving classical mechanics from quantum mechanics. A key feature of the method is its compatibility with the standard approach used to derive transition rates between quantum states due to interactions. We apply the developed method to derive the main formulas of physical kinetics. We observe that, through the Liouville equation, we can deduce the non-collision part of the Boltzmann equation, and that, through the matrix of transition rates, we can deduce the collision integral. As a final result of the manuscript, we derive the Boltzmann equation from the Schr\"odinger equation as a single piece of formal mathematical manipulation, without any non-rigorous plausible reasoning used to glue together its different parts.</description>
