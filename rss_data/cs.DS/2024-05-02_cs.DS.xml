      <title>Finding Diverse Strings and Longest Common Subsequences in a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study for the first time the Diverse Longest Common Subsequences (LCSs) problem under Hamming distance. Given a set of a constant number of input strings, the problem asks to decide if there exists some subset $\mathcal X$ of $K$ longest common subsequences whose diversity is no less than a specified threshold $\Delta$, where we consider two types of diversities of a set $\mathcal X$ of strings of equal length: the Sum diversity and the Min diversity defined as the sum and the minimum of the pairwise Hamming distance between any two strings in $\mathcal X$, respectively. We analyze the computational complexity of the respective problems with Sum- and Min-diversity measures, called the Max-Sum and Max-Min Diverse LCSs, respectively, considering both approximation algorithms and parameterized complexity. Our results are summarized as follows. When $K$ is bounded, both problems are polynomial time solvable. In contrast, when $K$ is unbounded, both problems become NP-hard, while Max-Sum Diverse LCSs problem admits a PTAS. Furthermore, we analyze the parameterized complexity of both problems with combinations of parameters $K$ and $r$, where $r$ is the length of the candidate strings to be selected. Importantly, all positive results above are proven in a more general setting, where an input is an edge-labeled directed acyclic graph (DAG) that succinctly represents a set of strings of the same length. Negative results are proven in the setting where an input is explicitly given as a set of strings. The latter results are equipped with an encoding such a set as the longest common subsequences of a specific input string set.</description>

      <title>Improved Massively Parallel Triangle Counting in $O(1)$ Rounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we give a novel algorithm for $O(1)$ round triangle counting in bounded arboricity graphs. Counting triangles in $O(1)$ rounds (exactly) is listed as one of the interesting remaining open problems in the recent survey of Im et al. [IKLMV23]. The previous paper of Biswas et al. [BELMR20], which achieved the best bounds under this setting, used $O(\log \log n)$ rounds in sublinear space per machine and $O(m\alpha)$ total space where $\alpha$ is the arboricity of the graph and $n$ and $m$ are the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. Our new algorithm is very simple, achieves the optimal $O(1)$ rounds without increasing the space per machine and the total space, and has the potential of being easily implementable in practice.</description>

      <title>Subquadratic Submodular Maximization with a General Matroid Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fast algorithms for monotone submodular maximization with a general matroid constraint. We present a randomized $(1 - 1/e - \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that requires $\tilde{O}_{\epsilon}(\sqrt{r} n)$ independence oracle and value oracle queries, where $n$ is the number of elements in the matroid and $r \leq n$ is the rank of the matroid. This improves upon the previously best algorithm by Buchbinder-Feldman-Schwartz [Mathematics of Operations Research 2017] that requires $\tilde{O}_{\epsilon}(r^2 + \sqrt{r}n)$ queries.
  Our algorithm is based on continuous relaxation, as with other submodular maximization algorithms in the literature. To achieve subquadratic query complexity, we develop a new rounding algorithm, which is our main technical contribution. The rounding algorithm takes as input a point represented as a convex combination of $t$ bases of a matroid and rounds it to an integral solution. Our rounding algorithm requires $\tilde{O}(r^{3/2} t)$ independence oracle queries, while the previously best rounding algorithm by Chekuri-Vondr\'{a}k-Zenklusen [FOCS 2010] requires $O(r^2 t)$ independence oracle queries. A key idea in our rounding algorithm is to use a directed cycle of arbitrary length in an auxiliary graph, while the algorithm of Chekuri-Vondr\'{a}k-Zenklusen focused on directed cycles of length two.</description>

      <title>Improved linearly ordered colorings of hypergraphs via SDP rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of linearly ordered (LO) coloring of hypergraphs. A hypergraph has an LO coloring if there is a vertex coloring, using a set of ordered colors, so that (i) no edge is monochromatic, and (ii) each edge has a unique maximum color. It is an open question as to whether or not a 2-LO colorable 3-uniform hypergraph can be LO colored with 3 colors in polynomial time. Nakajima and Zivn\'{y} recently gave a polynomial-time algorithm to color such hypergraphs with $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ colors and asked if SDP methods can be used directly to obtain improved bounds. Our main result is to show how to use SDP-based rounding methods to produce an LO coloring with $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/5})$ colors for such hypergraphs. We first show that we can reduce the problem to cases with highly structured SDP solutions, which we call balanced hypergraphs. Then we show how to apply classic SDP-rounding tools in this case. We believe that the reduction to balanced hypergraphs is novel and could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Clique-free t-matchings in degree-bounded graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider problems of finding a maximum size/weight $t$-matching without forbidden subgraphs in an undirected graph $G$ with the maximum degree bounded by $t+1$, where $t$ is an integer greater than $2$. Depending on the variant forbidden subgraphs denote certain subsets of $t$-regular complete partite subgraphs of $G$. A graph is complete partite if there exists a partition of its vertex set such that every pair of vertices from different sets is connected by an edge and vertices from the same set form an independent set. A clique $K_t$ and a bipartite clique $K_{t,t}$ are examples of complete partite graphs. These problems are natural generalizations of the triangle-free and square-free $2$-matching problems in subcubic graphs. In the weighted setting we assume that the weights of edges of $G$ are vertex-induced on every forbidden subgraph. We present simple and fast combinatorial algorithms for these problems. The presented algorithms are the first ones for the weighted versions, and for the unweighted ones, are faster than those known previously. Our approach relies on the use of gadgets with so-called half-edges. A half-edge of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints.</description>

      <title>A quantum neural network framework for scalable quantum circuit approximation of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Lie group theoretic approach for parametric representation of unitary matrices. This leads to develop a quantum neural network framework for quantum circuit approximation of multi-qubit unitary gates. Layers of the neural networks are defined by product of exponential of certain elements of the Standard Recursive Block Basis, which we introduce as an alternative to Pauli string basis for matrix algebra of complex matrices of order $2^n$. The recursive construction of the neural networks implies that the quantum circuit approximation is scalable i.e. quantum circuit for an $(n+1)$-qubit unitary can be constructed from the circuit of $n$-qubit system by adding a few CNOT gates and single-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Structure learning of Hamiltonians from real-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of Hamiltonian structure learning from real-time evolution: given the ability to apply $e^{-\mathrm{i} Ht}$ for an unknown local Hamiltonian $H = \sum_{a = 1}^m \lambda_a E_a$ on $n$ qubits, the goal is to recover $H$. This problem is already well-studied under the assumption that the interaction terms, $E_a$, are given, and only the interaction strengths, $\lambda_a$, are unknown. But is it possible to learn a local Hamiltonian without prior knowledge of its interaction structure?
  We present a new, general approach to Hamiltonian learning that not only solves the challenging structure learning variant, but also resolves other open questions in the area, all while achieving the gold standard of Heisenberg-limited scaling. In particular, our algorithm recovers the Hamiltonian to $\varepsilon$ error with an evolution time scaling with $1/\varepsilon$, and has the following appealing properties: (1) it does not need to know the Hamiltonian terms; (2) it works beyond the short-range setting, extending to any Hamiltonian $H$ where the sum of terms interacting with a qubit has bounded norm; (3) it evolves according to $H$ in constant time $t$ increments, thus achieving constant time resolution. To our knowledge, no prior algorithm with Heisenberg-limited scaling existed with even one of these properties. As an application, we can also learn Hamiltonians exhibiting power-law decay up to accuracy $\varepsilon$ with total evolution time beating the standard limit of $1/\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Release of Israel's National Registry of Live Births</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In February 2024, Israel's Ministry of Health released microdata of live births in Israel in 2014. The dataset is based on Israel's National Registry of Live Births and offers substantial value in multiple areas, such as scientific research and policy-making. At the same time, the data was processed so as to protect the privacy of 2014's mothers and newborns. The release was co-designed by the authors together with stakeholders from both inside and outside the Ministry of Health. This paper presents the methodology used to obtain that release. It also describes the considerations involved in choosing the methodology and the process followed.
  We used differential privacy as our formal measure of the privacy loss incurred by the released dataset. More concretely, we prove that the released dataset is differentially private with privacy loss budget \varepsilon = 9.98. We extensively used the private selection algorithm of Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019) to bundle together multiple steps such as data transformation, model generation algorithm, hyperparameter selection, and evaluation. The model generation algorithm selected was PrivBayes (Zhang et al., SIGMOD 2014). The evaluation was based on a list of acceptance criteria, which were also disclosed only approximately so as to provide an overall differential privacy guarantee. We also discuss concrete challenges and barriers that appear relevant to the next steps of this pilot project, as well as to future differentially private releases.</description>

      <title>Metric geometry of the privacy-utility tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data are an attractive concept to enable privacy in data sharing. A fundamental question is how similar the privacy-preserving synthetic data are compared to the true data. Using metric privacy, an effective generalization of differential privacy beyond the discrete setting, we raise the problem of characterizing the optimal privacy-accuracy tradeoff by the metric geometry of the underlying space. We provide a partial solution to this problem in terms of the "entropic scale", a quantity that captures the multiscale geometry of a metric space via the behavior of its packing numbers. We illustrate the applicability of our privacy-accuracy tradeoff framework via a diverse set of examples of metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Realizing temporal graphs from fastest travel times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we initiate the study of the temporal graph realization problem with respect to the fastest path durations among its vertices, while we focus on periodic temporal graphs. Given an $n \times n$ matrix $D$ and a $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}$, the goal is to construct a $\Delta$-periodic temporal graph with $n$ vertices such that the duration of a fastest path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ is equal to $D_{i,j}$, or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist. The variations of the problem on static graphs have been well studied and understood since the 1960's (e.g. [Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, 1960], [Hakimi and Yau, 1965]).
  As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal) counterpart. First, we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the ``tree-likeness''. We prove a tight classification between such parameters that allow fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and those which imply W[1]-hardness. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number (and therefore also any smaller parameter such as treewidth, degeneracy, and cliquewidth) of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the feedback edge number (and therefore also any larger parameter such as maximum leaf number) of the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>A Tight Lower Bound for 3-Coloring Grids in the Online-LOCAL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, \citeauthor*{akbari2021locality}~(ICALP 2023) studied the locality of graph problems in distributed, sequential, dynamic, and online settings from a {unified} point of view. They designed a novel $O(\log n)$-locality deterministic algorithm for proper 3-coloring bipartite graphs in the $\mathsf{Online}$-$\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model. In this work, we establish the optimality of the algorithm by showing a \textit{tight} deterministic $\Omega(\log n)$ locality lower bound, which holds even on grids. To complement this result, we have the following additional results:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We show a higher and {tight} $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for 3-coloring toroidal and cylindrical grids.
  \item Considering the generalization of $3$-coloring bipartite graphs to $(k+1)$-coloring $k$-partite graphs, %where $k \geq 2$ is a constant,
  we show that the problem also has $O(\log n)$ locality when the input is a $k$-partite graph that admits a \emph{locally inferable unique coloring}. This special class of $k$-partite graphs covers several fundamental graph classes such as $k$-trees and triangular grids. Moreover, for this special class of graphs, we show a {tight} $\Omega(\log n)$ locality lower bound.
  \item For general $k$-partite graphs with $k \geq 3$, we prove that the problem of $(2k-2)$-coloring $k$-partite graphs exhibits a locality of $\Omega(n)$ in the $\onlineLOCAL$ model, matching the round complexity of the same problem in the $\LOCAL$ model recently shown by \citeauthor*{coiteux2023no}~(STOC 2024). Consequently, the problem of $(k+1)$-coloring $k$-partite graphs admits a locality lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ when $k\geq 3$, contrasting sharply with the $\Theta(\log n)$ locality for the case of $k=2$. \end{enumerate}</description>

      <title>Parameterized Linear Time Transitive Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inquiries such as whether a task A depends on a task B, whether an author A has been influenced by a paper B, whether a certain protein is associated with a specific biological process or molecular function, or whether class A inherits from class B, are just a few examples of inquiries that can be modeled as reachability queries on a network (Directed Graph). Digital systems answer myriad such inquiries every day.
  In this paper, we discuss the transitive closure problem. We focus on applicable solutions that enable us to answer queries fast, in constant time, and can serve in real-world applications. In contrast to the majority of research on this topic that revolves around the construction of a two-dimensional adjacency matrix, we present an approach that builds a reachability indexing scheme. This scheme enables us to answer queries in constant time and can be built in parameterized linear time. In addition, it captures a compressed data structure. Our approach and algorithms are validated by extensive experiments that shed light on the factors that play a key role in this problem. To stress the efficiency of this solution and demonstrate the potential to apply our approach to important problems, we use it to speed up Fulkerson's method for finding the width of a DAG. Our results challenge the prevailing belief, reiterated over the last thirty years, regarding the efficiency of this method.
  Our approach is based on the concept of chain decomposition. Before we delve into its description, we introduce, analyze, and utilize a chain decomposition algorithm. Furthermore, we explore how chain decomposition can facilitate transitive closure solutions introducing a general purpose linear time reduction technique that removes a large subset of transitive edges given any chain decomposition.</description>

      <title>Maximum Matchings in Geometric Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.02123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an intersection graph of $n$ geometric objects in the plane. We show that a maximum matching in $G$ can be found in $O(\rho^{3\omega/2}n^{\omega/2})$ time with high probability, where $\rho$ is the density of the geometric objects and $\omega&gt;2$ is a constant such that $n \times n$ matrices can be multiplied in $O(n^\omega)$ time.
  The same result holds for any subgraph of $G$, as long as a geometric representation is at hand. For this, we combine algebraic methods, namely computing the rank of a matrix via Gaussian elimination, with the fact that geometric intersection graphs have small separators.
  We also show that in many interesting cases, the maximum matching problem in a general geometric intersection graph can be reduced to the case of bounded density. In particular, a maximum matching in the intersection graph of any family of translates of a convex object in the plane can be found in $O(n^{\omega/2})$ time with high probability, and a maximum matching in the intersection graph of a family of planar disks with radii in $[1, \Psi]$ can be found in $O(\Psi^6\log^{11} n + \Psi^{12 \omega} n^{\omega/2})$ time with high probability.</description>

Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>
