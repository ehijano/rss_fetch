      <title>A Tokenized Sovereign Debt Conversion Mechanism for Dynamic Public Debt Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Tokenized Sovereign Debt Conversion Mechanism (TSDCM), a smart-contracted instrument that, upon meeting both debt-to-GDP and GDP-growth thresholds, automates the retirement of sovereign debt. TSDCM initiates the conversion of a portion of outstanding bonds into performance-linked tokens by integrating a two-state regime-switching jump-diffusion framework into decentralized protocols. We prove finite-time activation and expected debt reduction through new propositions, establish the existence and uniqueness of the underlying stochastic processes, and introduce a main theorem that ensures a strict decline in expected debt levels. With significant tail-risk mitigation, calibration using IMF data and MATLAB Monte Carlo simulations shows a 20-25% decrease in expected debt-to-GDP ratios over a ten-year period. A transparent and incentive-aligned route to sustainable sovereign debt management is provided by TSDCM.</description>

      <title>A Keynesian Intertemporal Synthesis (KIS) Model: Towards a unified and empirically grounded framework for fiscal policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new generation of the Keynesian Intertemporal Synthesis (KIS) Model, a macroeconomic framework designed to reconcile the empirical strengths of the Post-Keynesian (PK) and New Keynesian (NK) traditions. The central innovation of this work is the abandonment of the traditional Cobb-Douglas production function in favor of a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) specification. This modification is directly motivated by the compelling evidence from the meta-analysis by Gechert et al. (2021), which emphatically rejects the hypothesis of a unit elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. We integrate this finding with the conclusions from a wide range of meta-analyses on the state-dependent heterogeneity of fiscal multipliers (Gechert and Rannenberg, 2018), the productivity of public capital (Bom and Ligthart, 2014), the effectiveness hierarchy of spending instruments (Gechert, 2015), and the empirical failure of Ricardian Equivalence (Stanley, 1998). The resulting KIS-CES model, while based on intertemporal optimization, incorporates household heterogeneity, non-standard preferences that value wealth and penalize debt, and a monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound. The mathematical derivations reveal that the elasticity of substitution, calibrated to an empirically plausible value of $\sigma &lt; 1$, becomes a key parameter that modulates income distribution and magnifies the crowding-in effect of public investment. The model generates an endogenous MPC, a nonlinear fiscal multiplier that increases dramatically in crises, and a multiplier for public investment that is structurally higher than that for consumption, thus offering a unified, rigorous, and, above all, empirically disciplined theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Concentration and Markups in International Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives a closed-form expression linking aggregate markups on imported inputs to concentration in a model of firm-to-firm trade with two-sided market power. Our theory extends standard oligopoly insights in two dimensions. First, it reveals that markups increase with exporter concentration and decrease with importer concentration, reflecting the balance of oligopoly and oligopsony forces. Second, it adapts conventional market definitions to reflect rigid trading relationships, yielding new concentration measures that capture competition in firm-to-firm trade. Analysis of Colombian transaction-level import data shows these differences are key to understanding markup dynamics in international trade.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.</description>

      <title>Formal Power Series Representations in Probability and Expected Utility Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance a general theory of coherent preference that surrenders restrictions embodied in orthodox doctrine. This theory enjoys the property that any preference system admits extension to a complete system of preferences, provided it satisfies a certain coherence requirement analogous to the one de Finetti advanced for his foundations of probability. Unlike de Finetti's theory, the one we set forth requires neither transitivity nor Archimedeanness nor boundedness nor continuity of preference. This theory also enjoys the property that any complete preference system meeting the standard of coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the reals. Representability by utility is a corollary of this paper's central result, which at once extends H\"older's Theorem and strengthens Hahn's Embedding Theorem.</description>

      <title>J4CC, A Frame for Communication Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Politics increasingly faces conflicts that appear irreconcilable, where one party's requirements directly contradict those of another. We propose J4CC, a frame for mapping how four forces (Power, Capital, Morality, and Knowledge) influence rule-making. J4CC provides a jargon for analyzing rule-making conversations. Beyond ideas about framing (Lakoff 2004; Rein &amp; Sch\"on, 1996), it draws on ideas from legal theory (Fuller 1967), institutional economics (Coase 1937), anthropology (Douglas 1992), and AI (Lewis et al. 2020). While our ultimate goal is to develop a working and usable AI language model (actually a 'jargon model'), this article focuses for now on its conceptual foundation. We demonstrate J4CC's analytical power through three case studies that profile seemingly incompatible positions. First, of influential thinkers (Confucius, Friedman, Montesquieu, Popper, Goodfellow) and their environments. Then, of governance dynamics (in the US during the first 5 months of 2025). Finally, of two contrasting interpretations thereof (Klein-Taylor's (2025) "end of time fascism" versus Bobbitt's (2025) "constitutional degradation"). The studies confirm that J4CC can profile positions from incompatible governance philosophies without clogging communication channels, sometimes also by providing translation mechanisms. Rather than eliminating disagreements, the framework enables productive engagement by making explicit the underlying tensions that lead to institutional conflicts. Our case studies lead to the conclusion that J4CC in its current form is a usable instrument for analyzing failing political debate. We add in the appendix our position on the feasibility that the J4CC framework can develop its intended jargon through application in an AI language model trained on large numbers of negotiation records.</description>

      <title>Renegotiation-Proof Cheap Talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An informed Advisor and an uninformed Decision-Maker, with conflicting interests, engage in repeated cheap talk communication in always new decision problems. While the Decision-Maker's optimal payoff is attainable in some subgame-perfect equilibrium, no payoff profile close to the Decision-Maker's optimal one is immune to renegotiation. Pareto efficient renegotiation-proof equilibria entail a compromise between the Advisor and the Decision-Maker. This could involve the Advisor being truthful and the Decision-Maker not fully utilizing this information to their advantage, or the Advisor exaggerating the truth and the Decision-Maker pretending to believe them.</description>

      <title>The (Mis)use of Information in Decentralised Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seller offers an asset in a decentralised market. Buyers have private signals about their common value. I study whether the market becomes allocatively more efficient with (i) more buyers, (ii) better-informed buyers. Both increase the information available about buyers' common value, but also the adverse selection each buyer faces. With more buyers, trade surplus eventually increases and converges to the full-information upper bound if and only if the likelihood ratios of buyers' signals are unbounded from above. Otherwise, it eventually decreases and converges to the no-information lower bound. With better information about trades buyers would have accepted, trade surplus increases. With better information about trades they would have rejected, trade surplus decreases--unless adverse selection is irrelevant. For binary signals, a sharper characterisation emerges: stronger good news increase total surplus, but stronger bad news eventually decrease it.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Estimating Preferences Using Response Time Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general methodology for recovering preference parameters from data on choices and response times. Our methods yield estimates with fast ($1/n$ for $n$ data points) convergence rates when specialized to the popular Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), but are broadly applicable to generalizations of the DDM as well as to alternative models of decision making that make use of response time data. The paper develops an empirical application to an experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically relevant parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimally Dictatorial Committees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the optimal voting mechanism for a committee that must decide whether to enact or block a policy of unknown benefit. Information can come both from committee members who can acquire it at cost, and a strategic lobbyist who wishes the policy to be enacted. I show that the dictatorship of the most-demanding member is a dominant voting mechanism: any other voting mechanism is (i) less likely to enact a good policy, (ii) more likely to enact a bad policy, and (iii) burdens each member with a greater cost of acquiring information.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>
