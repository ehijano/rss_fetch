      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Plasmon-Enabled Monolithic Bragg Reflectors for Infrared Light via Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-reflectivity mirrors in the mid-infrared (MIR) range are essential for next-generation optoelectronic devices but are still constrained by strain accumulation, poor thermal conductivity, and growth instability of thick multi-alloy stacks in conventional distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). We introduce plasmon-enabled DBRs (PE DBRs) based on modulation-doped monolithic InP, where plasmonic dispersion in highly doped layers provides a strong refractive-index contrast. Using inverse-design optimization targeting reduced free-carrier absorption and maximized reflectivity, we demonstrate that PE DBRs can achieve reflectivities approaching 100%. Experimentally grown 14 {\mu}m thick InP PE DBRs exhibit up to 99% reflectance with bandwidths reaching 18% of the design wavelength. The monolithic, junction-free configuration ensures low resistivity and enhanced thermal performance, offering a scalable platform for efficient plasmonic mirrors in MIR photonics, with potential applications in photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and lasers.</description>

      <title>Multiband Topological Heterojunctions on the Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogue Hamiltonian simulation (AHS) in photonic systems can be an enticing alternative to direct experimental study of complex Hamiltonian systems as a result of the low cost and high degree of control one can have over the system's properties. Notably, the field of topological photonics has emerged in the last decade primarily by simulating tight-binding models of electrons within topologically nontrivial condensed-matter systems. Optical simulation of topologically nontrivial Hamiltonians requires optical resonators with minimal loss and well-matched frequencies whose intersite coupling can also be precisely controlled. The Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) platform satisfies all these requirements, exhibiting ultra-low loss operation and sub-angstrom fabrication precision, making it an excellent platform for AHS. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first topologically nontrivial photonic SNAP devices by coupling together axial modes of adjacent SNAP microresonators to form a variety of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. The devices manifest numerous distinct topological band structures corresponding to each axial mode of the microresonators, enabling us to observe behavior both close to and far from the topological-trivial phase transition. We further expand the scope of topological SNAP systems to contain not just higher-order generalizations of SSH lattices, but junctions between multiband lattices with dissimilar topological phases created by coupling up to 21 uniform and well-matched SNAP microresonators. Analyzing such "heterojunctions" necessitated our development of generalized topological polarization methods. We thus demonstrate the exceptional promise of the SNAP platform for AHS of 1D topological insulators, and also open the door to the potential for simulating &gt;2 dimensional systems by utilizing nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'erot Metacavities with Single-Layered Dielectric Metamirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator is a cornerstone of photonics and wave physics, providing a universal mechanism for spectral confinement and resonant enhancement of wave-matter interactions. In this work, we establish an analytically tractable class of Fabry-P\'{e}rot metacavities in which the reflecting elements are realized by single-layer periodic arrays of circular dielectric cylinders acting as metamirrors. Both the reflection efficiency and reflection phase of such metamirrors are obtained in closed form and shown to be widely and independently tunable, encompassing ideal electric and magnetic mirror limits with unit reflectivity. Building on these results, we derive explicit analytical expressions that fully describe the optical responses of Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavities composed of two such parallel metamirrors. Our combined analytical and numerical investigations reveal that these metamirrors provide exceptional flexibility for tailoring Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonances across a broad spectral range, enabling precise control over resonance positions and quality factors. In particular, the framework naturally predicts the emergence of Fabry-P\'{e}rot bound states in the continuum with formally infinite Q-factors. These results establish dielectric-metamirror-based Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavities as a versatile and fundamentally transparent platform for engineering high-Q optical resonances.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle time-refraction at optical frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large and abrupt variations in the electromagnetic properties of materials lead to dramatic effects: even a single step-like change in the refractive index induces striking phenomena, such as time-refraction and time-reflection. When the refractive index varies periodically in time, multiple time-refractions and -reflections interfere, giving rise to photonic time-crystals (PTCs). Importantly, PTCs display momentum bands separated by gaps in which the modes experience exponential amplification, drawing energy from the modulation in a non-resonant fashion. Ordinary nonlinear optics does not operate in this regime: the material response is either very weak or very slow. One of the immediate consequences is that time-reflection of light at optical frequencies has never been observed in experiments. Here, we experimentally realize an order-unity change in the refractive index occurring at sub-cycle rates, and explore the phenomena emerging from it. By varying the duration of the index change from extending over many cycles to being significantly below a single cycle, we observe that the frequency shift of the time-refraction is enhanced as the index variation occurs faster. Our experiment is the gateway for realizing sharp time-interfaces at optical frequencies, which are the key for experimenting with time-reflection, PTCs and new phenomena expected from light-matter interactions in time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics of Enantiomers in Chiral Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, the absence of mirror symmetry, is a fundamental molecular property with far-reaching consequences from chemistry to biology. Yet enantiosensitive optical responses are very weak. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework in which a chiral optical cavity under strong coupling directly lifts the degeneracy of opposite enantiomers at the electronic-dipole level. The cavity's parity-breaking field inside the cavity induces distinct site-energy shifts for left- versus right-handed molecules, producing robust enantioselective polariton states that overcome the weakness of traditional chiroptical effects. Using cavity quantum electrodynamics simulations, we show that strong light-matter coupling reshapes the polaritonic energy landscape and leads to enantiomer-specific coherence lifetimes and relaxation pathways. To reveal these dynamics, we propose ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) as a probe, capable of resolving polaritonic splittings on femtosecond timescales. Simulated 2DES spectra exhibit unambiguous enantioselective signatures of the cavity-induced asymmetry. These findings establish that chiral cavities provide a powerful platform for detecting and controlling molecular handedness beyond the limits of conventional optical methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tailoring of Inhomogeneous Optical Response Using Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles is a key challenge in advancing light-matter interaction engineering. We present a comparative study of two spectral tailoring approaches using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS): the prepulse and double-pulse (DP) methods. In the prepulse scheme, a high-intensity pulse induces Rabi oscillations, modulating the 2D spectral amplitude and lineshape when its spectral bandwidth matches the ensemble full width at half maximum (FWHM). To overcome this limitation, the DP method employs variable inter-pulse delay to generate predetermined periodic spectral modulation without bandwidth constraints. Moreover, tuning the relative phase between DP pulses allows selective switching of frequency components, enabling controlled enhancement or suppression of distinct spectral features. These observations highlight that, while the prepulse approach is constrained by spectral bandwidth, the DP method provides a more versatile and reliable route to manipulate the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles. We are hoping these findings might stimulate further research in optical switching and coherent storage for quantum memory devices using inhomogeneous ensembles.</description>

      <title>Phonon Trapping Lateral Field Excited Suspended Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators (XBARs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBARs) underpin modern wireless communication by enabling compact, high-performance RF filters in modern smartphones. Traditionally, these FBAR devices work with quasi-plane waves of sound where the transverse extent of the acoustic field $\gg$ the acoustic wavelength ($\lambda_a$). On the other hand, strong modal confinement is needed for achieving the interaction strengths necessary for building efficient microwave to optical quantum photon transducers (MW-OT) around an FBAR opto-mechanical cavity platform. Here, we fabricate a small mode-volume phonon trapping lateral field excited FBAR resonator (XBAR) by shaping the piezoelectric layer into a spherical lens, show an improvement in modal confinement and quality factor ($\approx$ 4$\times$), and discuss the improvements needed for building efficient MW-OTs around this XBAR geometry.</description>

      <title>Spin waves excited by hard x-ray transient gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in ultrafast x-ray sources helped establish x-rays as an important tool for probing lattice and magnetic dynamics initiated by femtosecond optical pulses. Here, we explore the potential of ultrashort hard x-ray pulses for driving magnetic dynamics. We use a transient grating technique in which a spatially periodic x-ray excitation pattern gives rise to material excitations at a well-defined wave vector, whose dynamics are monitored via diffraction of an optical probe pulse. The excitation of a ferrimagnetic gadolinium bismuth iron garnet film placed in an external tilted magnetic field by x-rays at the Gd L3 edge results in both magnetic and non-magnetic transient gratings whose contributions to the diffracted signal are separated by polarization analysis. We observe the magnetization precession at both longitudinal acoustic and spin wave frequencies. An analysis with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation indicates that the magnetization precession is driven by strain resulting from thermal expansion induced by absorbed x-rays. The results establish x-ray transient gratings as a tool for driving coherent phonons and magnons, with the potential of accessing wave vectors across the entire Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the metal-dielectric metasurface unit cell for sensitivity enhancement in determination of IgG concentration in solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on developing a metal-dielectric sensor structure with optimized unit cell geometry for determination of protein Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration in aqueous solutions. The research combines both experimental and theoretical investigations, utilizing the differential microwave dielectrometry method and numerical modeling with COMSOL software. Complex permittivity (CP) values dependence of IgG water solutions on the protein concentration was experimentally obtained at the microwaves using original microwave dielectrometer setup. It was shown that increase of IgG concentration resulted in the CP values of the solutions studied decrease. The experimentally obtained CP data for the IgG water solutions were used as a basis for microwave metal-dielectric metasurface unit cell numerical modeling. The metal-dielectric metasurface consisting of Teflon substrate and plane copper microresonators was combined with a standard 96-well microplate used in clinical laboratories. Optimization of the obtained metasurface unit cell revealed that the size and position of the copper microresonators within the unit cell significantly impact the sensor sensitivity for determining the IgG concentration in aqueous solutions. The metasurface with the unit cell containing four copper microresonators provided the most sensitive platform for detecting variations in the IgG concentration in the sample. The frequency shift of the reflection coefficient was directly related to changes in the protein concentration. The calibration graph was developed for effective determination of IgG concentrations in the aqueous solutions.</description>

      <title>Terahertz metasurface sensor with graphene microstrips for biosensing: modeling and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study is devoted to development and optimization of a metasurface-based sensor with graphene constituents for potential biosensing applications. A unit cell of the proposed metasurface consists of a thin flexible dielectric substrate layer with a centrally positioned graphene microstrip. As a result of numerical modeling of spectral properties of the metasurface by COMSOL Multiphysics software in terahertz range from 5 to 35 THz the absorption spectrum maxima (resonance modes) are revealed. The following stages of the study demonstrate that placement of a layer of tested liquid sample (water or Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution) on the metasurface causes a low frequency shift of the plasmonic resonance mode chosen for biosensing measurements. This frequency shift, along with the change in the amplitude of the absorption peak, are highly sensitive to the refractive index of the tested liquid sample. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the developed metasurface-based sensor with graphene microstrips for application as a sensing structure to determine proteins and other biomolecules in liquid samples.</description>

      <title>Increasing The Sensitivity of a Surface Plasmon Resonance Sensor using Ti3C2 Mxene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensors based on the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance have limited sensitivity, up to 123 degree/Refractive Index Unit, which restricts their applicability in detecting subtle changes gin biological media (around 10-5 RIU). To address this, a sensor dependent on the Kretschmann-Reather configuration was modified using Ti3C2 MXene material. The sensor was modeled using the finite element method (FEM), yielding the dependence of the wave reflection parameter on the angle of incidence. Founded on these results, the sensitivity of the sensor was calculated and demonstrated a 10% improvement compared to the conventional Kretschmann-Reather configuration. In addition, human biological real-world samples were modeled using refractive index data, and the error of the proposed approach was determined to be approximately 3%.</description>

      <title>Scaleable LED-pumped Room-temperature Maser using a Multi-blade Optical Injector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the performance of room-temperature masers has improved over the last decade, relatively little attention has been paid to the optics used to pump the maser's gain medium. In this work, we investigate a novel multi-blade optical ``injector'' that permits more effective and more scaleable pumping. The reported work encompasses an interdisciplinary mix of conceptualization, simulation, crystal growth, fabrication, and microwave engineering. Our gain medium is pentacene dissolved as a solid solution with para-terphenyl (Pc:PTP) molecular crystal. We accurately determine this pentacene's molecular absorption cross-section as a function of wavelength. Ray-tracing is then used to assess how different designs of waveguide inject light into the Pc:PTP crystal. A multi-blade injector made of high-refractive-index glass (namely Ohara S-TIH6) is predicted to pump it more completely and uniformly than previous designs. Upon hand-fabricating such an injector and Bridgman-growing a crystal of 0.1% Pc:PTP over it, an experimental maser oscillator using this combined injector-crystal assembly is demonstrated. The performance and scaleability of multiblade injection vis-a-vis alternative strategies is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Directed Nano-antennas for Laser Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why do we use nano-antennas for fusion? In three sentences: The present laser induced fusion plans use extreme mechanical shock compression to get one hotspot and then ignition. Still fusion burning spreads slower than expansion, and mechanical instabilities may also develop. With nano-antennas in radiation dominated systems, simultaneous ignition can be achieved in the whole target volume and there is no time left for mechanical instabilities. Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.
  Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target. This arises from a mistaken assumption, [1] that the detonation normal 4-vector should have vanishing time-like component, and this assumption eliminates the possibility to rapid or even simultaneous, radiation dominated detonations, (which are well known in the burning (or hadronization) of Quark Gluon Plasma).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation (BISER) appears as a bright temporally and spatially coherent Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray source driven by compact multi-terawatt femtosecond lasers in gas targets. There BISER originates from relativistic plasma singularities, so that the emission source size has a nanometer scale. The BISER x-ray yield quadratically depends on the driving laser power. BISER spectra have hundreds of electronvolt (eV) bandwidth embracing the 'water window' region (284 - 543 eV). Simulations predict that BISER pulses have durations close to the transform limit, which promises pulses shorter than the atomic unit of time (24 attoseconds). Based on the BISER brightness at ~20 terawatt laser power and the quadratic scaling, the brightness of BISER driven by petawatt-class lasers is predicted to exceed XUV free electron lasers. The BISER concept creates a new framework for a wide range of media emitting travelling waves capable of constructive interference, including gravitational waves. Here we review the BISER experimental discovery, its explanation based on the relativistic laser plasma simulations and catastrophe theory, experimental validation of the theoretical BISER model, proposal for imaging fast moving singularities, driving laser requirements, and future prospects emphasizing the driving laser wavelength scalability and possibility of terawatt attosecond coherent x-ray pulse generation.</description>

      <title>A computational and pedagogical framework for projectile motion using Python visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projectile motion is one of the most fundamental problems in introductory physics, offering a clear context to connect algebraic reasoning with conceptual understanding. This work presents a computational and pedagogical framework that combines the analytical formulation of projectile motion with interactive visualizations developed in Python. Using reproducible simulations, the dependence of the maximum height and horizontal range on the launch parameters $(v_0,\theta)$ is examined through trajectory plots, parameter-space maps, and iso-curves. These visual representations reveal non-trivial combinations of initial conditions that yield equivalent outcomes, reinforcing physical intuition and providing an accessible open-source tool for teaching and learning classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Exponential: Decoherence-Driven Power-Law Spontaneous Emission in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system coupled to a photonic waveguide, showing that dynamical dephasing in the photon modes profoundly alters the decay law. In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduced, a robust power-law decay emerges already at short times, driven by photon diffusion in the dynamically disordered environment rather than spectral edge effects. These results reveal a novel, decoherence-induced mechanism for non-exponential spontaneous emission in waveguide QED platforms.</description>

      <title>Below-threshold error reduction in single photons through photon distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computers use the bosonic statistics of photons to construct, through quantum interference, the large entangled states required for measurement-based quantum computation. Therefore, any which-way information present in the photons will degrade quantum interference and introduce errors. While quantum error correction can address such errors in principle, it is highly resource-intensive and operates with a low error threshold, requiring numerous high-quality optical components. We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We anticipate photon distillation will find uses in large-scale quantum computers. We also expect this work to inspire the search for additional intrinsically bosonic error-reduction strategies, even for fault-tolerant architectures.</description>

      <title>Exceptional rings in nonlinear non-Hermitian planar optical microcavities: implementation, signal enhancement, and topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems hosting exceptional points (EPs) exhibit signal enhancement and unconventional mode dynamics. Going beyond isolated EPs, here we report on the existence of exceptional rings (ERs) in planar optical resonators with specific form of circular dichroism and TE-TM splitting. Such exceptional rings possess intriguing topologies as discussed earlier for condensed matter systems, but they remain virtually unexplored in presence of nonlinearity, for which our photonic platform is ideal. We find that when Kerr-type nonlinearity (or saturable gain) is introduced, the linear ER splits into two concentric ERs, with the larger-radius ring being a ring of third-order EPs. Transitioning from linear to nonlinear regime, we present a rigorous analysis of (spectral and band) topologies and report enhanced and adjustable perturbation response in the nonlinear regime. Whereas certain features are specific to our system, the results on non-Hermitian topologies and nonlinearity-enhanced perturbation response are generic and equally relevant to a broad class of other nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, providing a universal framework for engineering ERs and EPs in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

      <title>Astigmatism-free 3D Optical Tweezer Control for Rapid Atom Rearrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 136 $\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.</description>

      <title>From Light Diffusion to Photocatalytic Rates: Compact Scaling Laws for Strongly Scattering Porous Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light transport in strongly scattering porous photocatalytic materials governs the spatial distribution of absorbed photons and therefore the generation of charge carriers driving photocatalytic reactions. Yet translating measured optical properties of such media into intrinsic reaction rate constants remains challenging, as it requires simultaneously accounting for multiple scattering, boundary losses, photochemical efficiency, and surface kinetics. Here we develop a compact analytical framework that unifies these processes for nanoparticle-loaded photocatalytic slabs. Using a finite-slab diffusion model with extrapolated boundaries, we derive closed-form expressions for the fluence field and couple them to a photochemical quantum efficiency and first-order surface kinetics. The resulting predictors yield intrinsic volumetric and areal rate constants whose dependence on the transport mean free path, optical thickness, and surface-to-volume ratio emerges transparently. Validation against Monte-Carlo photon-migration simulations shows that the diffusion approximation reproduces the fluence and generation-rate profiles with a modest multiplicative mismatch, typically within a factor of about 1.20-1.39, depending on the anisotropy and scattering phase function. This level of agreement is consistent with the known limits of the diffusion approximation and is sufficient to enable reliable, design-oriented predictions. The analytical descriptors introduced here, such as l*, S/V and the extrapolation length zb are general, physically interpretable, and directly integrable into data-driven optimisation and geometry-engineered reactor design. The framework thus provides a versatile and physically grounded tool for photocatalytic systems across diverse applications, including VOC photo-degradation, indoor air purification, and solar-fuel production.</description>

Abstract: We show that first-return statistics in three-dimensional Henyey Greenstein scattering require a Boundary Truncation Factor (BTF) that takes a Cauchy kernel form. In our previous work (6), we established that first-return probabilities in 1D scattering expand in Catalan and Motzkin numbers. Extending this to 3D anisotropic scattering requires a BTF that, as Monte Carlo reveals, follows a Cauchy kernel:</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Basic quantum effects are often illustrated using single particle interferences in two-path interferometers. A wider range of non-classical phenomena can be illustrated using three-path interferometers, but the increased complexity of quantum statistics in a three-dimensional Hilbert space makes it difficult to identify a representative set of observable properties that could be used to characterize specific phenomena. Here, I propose a characterization of pure states based on a five-stage interferometer recently introduced to demonstrate the relation between different measurement contexts (Optica Quantum 1, 63 (2023)). It is shown that the orthogonality relations between the states representing the different measurement contexts can be used to classify pure states within the three-dimensional Hilbert space according to the non-classical correlations between different contexts expressed by negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.</description>

      <title>Microscopy system for in situ sea ice structure and biology observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sea ice harbours a rich community of well-adapted microorganisms that inhabit liquid micro-spaces where extreme conditions prevail. Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.</description>
