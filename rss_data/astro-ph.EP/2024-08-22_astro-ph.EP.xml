      <title>Aggregate Cloud Particle Effects in Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosol opacity has emerged as a critical factor controlling transmission and emission spectra. We provide a simple guideline for the effects of aerosol morphology on opacity and residence time in the atmosphere, as it pertains to transit observations, particularly those with flat spectra due to high altitude aerosols. This framework can be used for understanding complex cloud and haze particle properties before getting into detailed microphysical modeling. We consider high altitude aerosols to be composed of large fluffy particles that can have large residence times in the atmosphere and influence the deposition of stellar flux and/or the emergence of thermal emission in a different way than compact droplet particles, as generally modeled to date for extrasolar planetary atmospheres. We demonstrate the important influence of aggregate particle porosity and composition on the extent of the wavelength independent regime. We also consider how such fluffy particles reach such high altitudes and conclude that the most likely scenario is their local production at high altitudes via UV bombardment and subsequent blanketing of the atmosphere, rather than some mechanism of lofting or transport from the lower atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Phase equilibria of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of non-ideal chemical interaction between silicate and overlying hydrogen-rich envelopes for rocky planets using basic tenets of phase equilibria. Based on our current understanding of the temperature and pressure conditions for complete miscibility of silicate and hydrogen, we find that the silicate-hydrogen binary solvus will dictate the nature of atmospheres and internal layering in rocky planets that garnered H$_2$-rich primary atmospheres. The temperatures at the surfaces of supercritical magma oceans will correspond to the silicate-hydrogen solvus. As a result, the radial positions of supercritical magma ocean-atmosphere interfaces, rather than their temperatures and pressures, should reflect the thermal states of these planets. The conditions prescribed by the solvus influence the structure of the atmosphere, and thus the transit radii of sub-Neptunes. Separation of iron-rich metal to form metal cores in sub-Neptunes and super-Earths is not assured due to prospects for neutral buoyancy of metal in silicate melt induced by dissolution of H, Si, and O in the metal at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>A JWST MIRI MRS View of the $\eta$ Tel Debris Disk and its Brown Dwarf Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report JWST MIRI MRS observations of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group member, $\eta$ Telescopii ($\eta$ Tel) A and its brown dwarf binary companion, $\eta$ Tel B. Following PSF subtraction, we recover the spatially resolved flux from the debris disk around $\eta$ Tel A, along with the position of the companion exterior to the disk. We present a new 5-26 $\mu$m epoch of spectroscopy for the disk, in which we discover a 20 $\mu$m silicate feature. We also present the first ever 11-21 $\mu$m spectrum of $\eta$ Tel B, which indicates a bare photosphere. We derive a new epoch of relative astrometry for the companion, extending the baseline of measurements to 25 years, and find that its current location is consistent with the apocentre of an eccentric, long-period orbit. The companion's orbit is close enough to the disk that it should significantly perturb the planetesimals within it, resulting in a detectable mid-IR pericentre glow and near-alignment with the companion. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the disk appears to be axisymmetric and potentially misaligned with the companion in the MIRI MRS data. We posit that this may be due to the presence of an additional, yet-undetected 0.7-30 $M_J$ planet orbiting interior to the disk with a semi-major axis of 3-19 au.</description>

      <title>K2-399 b is not a planet. The Saturn that wandered through the Neptune desert is actually a hierarchical eclipsing binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transit technique has been very efficient in detecting planet candidate signals over the past decades. The so-called statistical validation approach has become a popular way of verifying a candidate's planetary nature. However, the incomplete consideration of false positive scenarios and data quality can lead to the misinterpretation of the results. In this work we revise the planetary status of K2-399\,b, a validated planet with an estimated false positive probability of 0.078% located in the middle of the so-called Neptunian desert, and hence a potential key target for atmospheric prospects. We use radial velocity data from the CARMENES, HARPS and TRES spectrographs, as well as ground-based multi-band transit photometry LCOGT MuSCAT3 and broad band photometry to test the planetary scenario. Our analysis of the available data does not support the existence of this (otherwise key) planet, and instead points to a scenario composed of an early G-dwarf orbited in a $846.62^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$~days period by a pair of eclipsing M-dwarfs (hence a hierarchical eclipsing binary) likely in the mid-type domain. We thus demote K2-399 b as a planet. We conclude that the validation process, while very useful to prioritise follow-up efforts, must always be conducted with careful attention to data quality while ensuring that all possible scenarios have been properly tested to get reliable results. We also encourage developers of validation algorithms to ensure the accuracy of a priori probabilities for different stellar scenarios that can lead to this kind of false validation. We further encourage the use of follow-up observations when possible (such as radial velocity and/or multi-band light curves) to confirm the planetary nature of detected transiting signals rather than only relying on validation tools.</description>

      <title>Survey of Complex Organic Molecules in Starless and Prestellar Cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold ($\sim$10 K) and dense ($\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) cores of gas and dust within molecular clouds, known as starless and dynamically evolved prestellar cores, are the birthplaces of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) stars. As detections of interstellar complex organic molecules, or COMs, in starless cores has increased, abundance comparisons suggest that some COMs might be seeded early in the star formation process and inherited to later stages (i.e., protostellar disks and eventually comets). To date observations of COMs in starless cores have been limited, with most detections reported solely in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. It is therefore still a question whether different environments affect abundances. We have surveyed 35 starless and prestellar cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope detecting both methanol, CH$_3$OH, and acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, in 100% and 49% of the sample, respectively. In the sub-sample of 15 cores where CH$_3$CHO was detected at $&gt;3\sigma$ ($\sim$18 mK) with the ARO 12m, follow-up observations with the Yebes 40m telescope were carried out. Detections of formic acid, $t$-HCOOH, ketene, H$_2$CCO, methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, vinyl cyanide, CH$_2$CHCN, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, are seen in at least $20\%$ of the cores. We discuss detection statistics, calculate column densities, and compare abundances across various stages of low-mass star formation. Our findings have more than doubled COM detection statistics in cold cores and show COMs are prevalent in the gas before star and planet formation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud.</description>

      <title>Filament formation due to diffusive instabilities in dusty protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the finding of a new, local diffusion instability in a protoplanetary disk, which can operate in a dust fluid, subject to mass diffusion, shear viscosity, and dust-gas drag, provided diffusivity, viscosity, or both decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing dust surface mass density. We devise a vertically averaged, axisymmetric hydrodynamic model to describe a dense, mid-plane dust layer in a protoplanetary disk. The gas is modeled as a passive component, imposing an effective, diffusion-dependent pressure, mass diffusivity, and viscosity onto the otherwise collisionless dust fluid, via turbulence excited by the gas alone, or dust and gas in combination. In particular, we argue that such conditions are met when the dust-gas mixture generates small-scale turbulence through the streaming instability, as supported by recent measurements of dust mass diffusion slopes in simulations. We hypothesize that the newly discovered instability may be the origin of filamentary features, almost ubiquitously found in simulations of the streaming instability. In addition, our model allows for growing oscillatory modes, which operate in a similar fashion as the axisymmetric viscous overstability in dense planetary rings. However, it remains speculative if the required conditions for such modes can be met in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic criterion for the formation of Circumplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of circumplanetary disks is central to our understanding of giant planet formation, influencing their growth rate during the post-runaway phase and observability while embedded in protoplanetary disks. We use 3D global multifluid radiation hydrodynamics simulations with the FARGO3D code to define the thermodynamic conditions that enable circumplanetary disk formation around Jovian planets on wide orbits. Our simulations include stellar irradiation, viscous heating, static mesh refinement, and active calculation of opacity based on evolving dust fluids. We find a necessary condition for the formation of circumplanetary disks in terms of a mean cooling time: when the cooling time is at least one order of magnitude shorter than the orbital time scale, the specific angular momentum of the gas is nearly Keplerian at scales of $R_{\rm{Hill}}/3$. We show that the inclusion of multifluid dust dynamics favors rotational support because dust settling produces an anisotropic opacity distribution that favors rapid cooling. In all our models with radiation hydrodynamics, specific angular momentum decreases as time evolves in agreement with the formation of an inner isentropic envelope due to compressional heating. The isentropic envelope can extend up to $R_{\rm{Hill}}/3$ and shows negligible rotational support. Thus, our results imply that young gas giant planets may host spherical isentropic envelopes, rather than circumplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>The open-source sunbather code: modeling escaping planetary atmospheres and their transit spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape is thought to significantly influence the evolution of exoplanets, especially for sub-Jupiter planets on short orbital periods. Theoretical models predict that hydrodynamic escape could erode the atmospheres of such gaseous planets, leaving only a rocky core. Deriving atmospheric mass-loss rates from observations is necessary to check these predictions. One of the ways to obtain mass-loss rate estimates is to fit transit spectra of the 10830 {\AA} helium or UV metal lines with Parker wind models. We aim to provide the community with a tool that enables performing this type of analysis, and present sunbather, an open-source Python code to model escaping exoplanet atmospheres and their transit spectra. sunbather incorporates the Parker wind code p-winds and the photoionization code Cloudy, with the ability to calculate any currently known spectral tracer at an arbitrary atmospheric composition. With sunbather, we investigate how the atmospheric structure of a generic hot Neptune planet depends on the metallicity. We find that the mass-loss rate drops by roughly one order of magnitude as we increase the metallicity from solar to 50 times solar. Line cooling by metal species is important already for a solar composition, and more so at higher metallicity. We then demonstrate how sunbather can be used to interpret observations of spectral lines that form in the upper atmosphere. We fit the observed helium spectrum of the mini-Neptune TOI-2134 b and show how even for helium data, the inferred mass-loss rate depends on the metallicity by up to a factor of three.</description>

      <title>The interior of Uranus: Thermal profile, bulk composition and the distribution of rock, water and hydrogen and helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present improved empirical density profiles of Uranus and interpret them in terms of their temperature and composition using a new random algorithm. The algorithm to determine the temperature and composition is agnostic with respect to the temperature gradient in non-isentropic regions and chooses randomly amongst all possible gradients that are stable against convection and correspond to an Equation of State compatible composition. Our empirical models are based on an efficient implementation of the Theory of Figures up to 10th order including a proper treatment of the atmosphere. The accuracy of 10th order ToF enables us to present accurate calculations of the gravitational moments of Uranus up to $J_{14}$: $J_{6} = ( 5.3078 \pm 0.3312)\cdot10^{-7}$, $J_{8} = (-1.1114 \pm 0.1391)\cdot10^{-8}$, $J_{10} = ( 2.8616 \pm 0.5466)\cdot10^{-10}$, $J_{12} = (-8.4684 \pm 2.0889)\cdot10^{-12}$ and $J_{14} = ( 2.7508 \pm 0.7944)\cdot10^{-13}$. We consider two interior models of Uranus that differ with respect to the maximal number of materials allowed per layer of Uranus (three vs. four composition components). The case with three materials does not allow Hydrogen and Helium in deeper parts of Uranus and results in a higher water abundance which leads to lower central temperatures. On the other hand, the models with four materials allow H-He to be mixed into the deeper interior and lead to rock-dominated solutions. We find that these four composition components models are less reliable due to the underlying empirical models incompatibility with realistic Brunt frequencies. Most of our models are found to be either purely convective with the exception of boundary layers, or only convective in the outermost region. Almost all of our models possess a region that is convective and consists of ionic H$_{2}$O which could explain the generation of Uranus' magnetic field.</description>

      <title>AtLAST Science Overview Report</title>

Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Effect of Tilted Corner Cube Reflector Arrays on Lunar Laser Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the effect of the tilt of corner cube reflector (CCR) arrays on lunar laser ranging (LLR). A mathematical model was established to study the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR arrays. The study found that, ideally, when the laser ranging pulse width is 10 picoseconds or less, it is possible to distinguish from which specific corner cubes within the CCR array each peak in the echo signal originates. Consequently, partial data from the echo can be extracted for signal processing, significantly reducing random errors and improving the single-shot precision of LLR. The distance obtained by extracting part of the echo can be reduced to the center position of the array, thereby providing multiple higher-precision ranging results from each measurement. This not only improves the precision of LLR but also increases the data volume. A simulation experiment based on the 1.2 m laser ranging system at Yunnan Observatories was conducted. By extracting one peak for signal processing, the single-shot precision improved from 32.24 mm to 2.52 mm, validating the theoretical analysis results. Finally, an experimental laser ranging system based on a 53 cm binocular telescope system was established for ground experiments. The experimental results indicated that the echo signal could identify the tilt state of the CCR array. By extracting the peak returned by the central CCR for signal processing, the ranging precision was greatly improved. Through theoretical analyses, simulation experiments, and ground experiments, a solution to reduce the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR array was provided. This offers an approach to enhance the single-shot precision of future LLR and provides a reference for upgrading ground-based equipment at future laser ranging stations.</description>
