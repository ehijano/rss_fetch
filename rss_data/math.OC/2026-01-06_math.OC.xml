      <title>Gradient-Free Approaches is a Key to an Efficient Interaction with Markovian Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with stochastic optimization problems involving Markovian noise with a zero-order oracle. We present and analyze a novel derivative-free method for solving such problems in strongly convex smooth and non-smooth settings with both one-point and two-point feedback oracles. Using a randomized batching scheme, we show that when mixing time $\tau$ of the underlying noise sequence is less than the dimension of the problem $d$, the convergence estimates of our method do not depend on $\tau$. This observation provides an efficient way to interact with Markovian stochasticity: instead of invoking the expensive first-order oracle, one should use the zero-order oracle. Finally, we complement our upper bounds with the corresponding lower bounds. This confirms the optimality of our results.</description>

      <title>Scalable Method for Mean Field Control with Kernel Interactions via Random Fourier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a scalable algorithm for mean field control problems with kernel interactions by combining particle system simulations with random Fourier feature approximations. The method replaces the quadratic-cost kernel evaluations by linear-time estimates, enabling efficient stochastic gradient descent for training feedback controls in large populations. We provide theoretical complexity bounds and demonstrate through crowd motion and flocking examples that the approach preserves control performance while substantially reducing computational cost. The results indicate that random feature approximations offer an effective and practical tool for high dimensional and large scale mean field control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Methods for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a stochastic control framework for global optimization over both finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In the Euclidean setting, the original minimization problem is approximated by a family of regularized stochastic control problems; using dynamic programming, we analyze the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations and obtain tractable representations via the Cole--Hopf transform and the Feynman--Kac formula. For optimization over probability measures, we formulate a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, and further approximate it by controlled $N$-particle systems. We establish that, as the regularization parameter tends to zero (and as the particle number tends to infinity for the optimization over probability measures), the value of the control problem converges to the global minimum of the original objective. Building on the resulting probabilistic representations, Monte Carlo-based numerical schemes are proposed and numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the practical performance of the methods and to support the theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Concave Certificates: Geometric Framework for Distributionally Robust Risk and Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally Robust (DR) optimization aims to certify worst-case risk within a Wasserstein uncertainty set. Current certifications typically rely either on global Lipschitz bounds, which are often conservative, or on local gradient information, which provides only a first-order approximation. This paper introduces a novel geometric framework based on the least concave majorants of the growth rate function. Our proposed concave certificate establishes a tight bound of DR risk that remains applicable to non-Lipschitz and non-differentiable losses. We extend this framework to complexity analysis, introducing a deterministic bound that complements standard statistical generalization bound. Furthermore, we utilize this certificate to bound the gap between adversarial and empirical Rademacher complexity, demonstrating that dependencies on input diameter, network width, and depth can be eliminated. For practical application in deep learning, we introduce the adversarial score as a tractable relaxation of the concave certificate that enables efficient and layer-wise analysis of neural networks. We validate our theoretical results in various numerical experiments on classification and regression tasks on real-world data.</description>

      <title>On IDA-PBC with Maximum Energy Shapeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) is a well-established stabilization technique for affine nonlinear systems. However, its application is generally hindered by the requirement of solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), i.e., the so-called matching equation. This paper introduces the notion of \emph{maximum energy shapeability} which describes the scenario that the homogeneous part of the matching equation admits $m$ independent solutions with $m$ the dimension of the control input. We demonstrate that the maximum energy shapeability enables a systematic procedure for the IDA-PBC design by transforming the matching equation into a set of easier-to-solve PDEs. Sufficient conditions for maximum energy shapeability are also provided. It is shown that some existing constructive IDA-PBC designs actually implicitly exploit the maximum energy shapeability. The proposed procedure for the IDA-PBC design is illustrated with the magnetic levitation system.</description>

      <title>Multiscale replay: A robust algorithm for stochastic variational inequalities with a Markovian buffer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Multiscale Experience Replay (MER) algorithm for solving a class of stochastic variational inequalities (VIs) in settings where samples are generated from a Markov chain and we have access to a memory buffer to store them. Rather than uniformly sampling from the buffer, MER utilizes a multi-scale sampling scheme to emulate the behavior of VI algorithms designed for independent and identically distributed samples, overcoming bias in the de facto serial scheme and thereby accelerating convergence. Notably, unlike standard sample-skipping variants of serial algorithms, MER is robust in that it achieves this acceleration in iteration complexity whenever possible, and without requiring knowledge of the mixing time of the Markov chain. We also discuss applications of MER, particularly in policy evaluation with temporal difference learning and in training generalized linear models with dependent data.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Functions can Exactly Quantify Rate Performance of Nonlinear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pointwise-in-time stability notions for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) provide quantitative metrics for system performance by establishing bounds on the rate of decay of the system state in terms of initial condition -- allowing stability to be quantified by e.g. the maximum provable decay rate. Such bounds may be obtained by finding suitable Lyapunov functions using, e.g. Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization. While Lyapunov tests have been proposed for numerous pointwise-in-time stability notions, including exponential, rational, and finite-time stability, it is unclear whether these characterizations are able to provide accurate bounds on system performance.
  In this paper, we start by proposing a generalized notion of rate performance -- with exponential, rational, and finite-time decay rates being special cases. Then, for any such notion and rate, we associate a Lyapunov condition which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a system to achieve that rate. Finally, we show how the proposed conditions can be enforced using SOS programming in the case of exponential, rational, and finite-time stability. Numerical examples in each case demonstrate that the corresponding SOS test can achieve tight bounds on the rate performance with accurate inner bounds on the associated regions of performance.</description>

      <title>A MINRES-based Linesearch Algorithm for Nonconvex Optimization with Non-positive Curvature Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a MINRES-based Newton-type algorithm for solving unconstrained nonconvex optimization problems. Our approach uses the minimal residual method (MINRES), a well-known solver for indefinite symmetric linear systems, to compute descent directions that leverage second-order and non-positive curvature (NPC) information. Comprehensive asymptotic convergence properties are derived under standard assumptions. In particular, under the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality and a mild NPC-detectability condition, we prove that our algorithm can avoid strict saddle points and converge to second-order critical points. This is primarily achieved by integrating proper regularization techniques and forward linesearch mechanisms along NPC directions. Furthermore, fast local superlinear convergence to potentially non-isolated minima is established, when the local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition is satisfied. Numerical experiments on the CUTEst test collection and on a deep auto-encoder problem illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider some optimal control problems governed by elliptic partial differential equations. The solution is the state variable, while the control variable is, depending on the case, the coefficient of the PDE, the potential, the right-hand side. The cost functional is of integral type and involves both the state and control variables.</description>

      <title>A Three-Tier Time-Scale Architecture for Controlling Complex Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a three-tier computational architecture for the real-time control of nonlinear complex systems, such as time-dependent PDEs. There is an important class of such problems for which existing single- and two-time-scale approaches are fundamentally insufficient due to lack of a priori system knowledge, computational complexity, model fidelity requirements, and uncertainty. The proposed architecture consists of an offline, meso-scale, and real-time layer of computation, with distinct roles for each layer and specific information flow between them. The result is a practical systems-level paradigm that enables real-time operation of complex nonlinear control problems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Maximum Principles and Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control Problems for Fractional Backward Stochastic Evolution Equations in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework for optimal control of systems governed by fractional backward stochastic evolution equations (FBSEEs) in Hilbert spaces. We first establish a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) as a necessary condition for optimality. This is achieved by introducing spike variations, deriving precise estimates for the associated variational equations, and constructing an adjoint process tailored to the fractional dynamics. Subsequently, we apply this general principle to solve the linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem explicitly. The resulting optimal control is characterized in closed form via the adjoint process and is shown to be governed by a system of coupled fractional forward-backward stochastic equations. Our work bridges fractional calculus with stochastic control theory, providing a rigorous foundation for controlling infinite-dimensional systems with memory and long-range dependencies.</description>

We derive a necessary and sufficient condition characterizing the well-posedness of these systems. Furthermore, we show that the well-posedness and full control and observation implies exact controllability and exact observability.

      <title>Adaptive Thrust Regulation in Solid-fuel Ramjet with Variable Geometry Inlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of a novel data-driven adaptive control technique, dynamic mode adaptive control (DMAC), to regulate thrust in a solid-fuel ramjet (SFRJ). A quasi-static one-dimensional model of SFRJ with a variable geometry inlet is developed to compute thrust. An adaptive tracking controller is then designed using the DMAC framework, which leverages dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the local system behavior, followed by a tracking controller designed around the identified model. Simulation results demonstrate that DMAC achieves accurate thrust regulation across a range of commanded profiles and operating conditions, without requiring an analytical model of the SFRJ. These findings indicate that DMAC provides a reliable and effective approach for model-free thrust regulation in an SFRJ with variable-geometry inlets as the control input.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Convergence and Stability of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Smooth Non-convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods, such as AdaGrad, have become fundamental tools in deep learning. Despite their widespread use, the asymptotic convergence of AdaGrad remains poorly understood in non-convex scenarios. In this work, we present the first rigorous asymptotic convergence analysis of AdaGrad-Norm for smooth non-convex optimization. Using a novel stopping-time partitioning technique, we establish a key stability result: the objective function values remain bounded in expectation, and the iterates are bounded almost surely under a mild coercivity assumption. Building on these stability results, we prove that AdaGrad-Norm achieves both almost sure and mean-square convergence. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to RMSProp and show that, with appropriate hyperparameter choices, it also enjoys stability and asymptotic convergence. The techniques developed herein may be of independent interest for analyzing other adaptive stochastic optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Perturbed DCA for Computing d-Stationary Points of Nonsmooth DC Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02084v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient perturbed difference-of-convex algorithm (pDCA) for computing d-stationary points of an important class of structured nonsmooth difference-of-convex problems. Compared to the principal algorithms introduced in [J.-S. Pang, M. Razaviyayn, and A. Alvarado, Math. Oper. Res. 42(1):95--118 (2017)], which may require solving several subproblems for a one-step update, pDCA only requires solving a single subproblem. Therefore, the computational cost of pDCA for one-step update is comparable to the widely used difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) introduced in [D. T. Pham and H. A. Le Thi, Acta Math. Vietnam. 22(1):289--355 (1997)] for computing a critical point. Importantly, under practical assumptions, we prove that every accumulation point of the sequence generated by pDCA is a d-stationary point almost surely. Numerical experiment results on several important examples of nonsmooth DC programs demonstrate the efficiency of pDCA for computing d-stationary points.</description>

      <title>Complexity of quadratic penalty methods with adaptive accuracy under a PL condition for the constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quadratic penalty method (QPM) for smooth nonconvex optimization problems with equality constraints. Assuming the constraint violation satisfies the PL condition near the feasible set, we derive sharper worst-case complexity bounds for obtaining approximate first-order KKT points. When the objective and constraints are twice continuously differentiable, we show that QPM equipped with a suitable first-order inner solver requires at most $O(\varepsilon_{0}^{-1}\varepsilon_{1}^{-2})$ first-order oracle calls to find an $(\varepsilon_{0},\varepsilon_{1})$-approximate KKT point -- that is, a point that is $\varepsilon_{0}$-approximately feasible and $\varepsilon_{1}$-approximately stationary. Furthermore, when the objective and constraints are three times continuously differentiable, we show that QPM with a suitable second-order inner solver requires at most $O\left(\varepsilon_{0}^{-1/2}\varepsilon_{1}^{-3/2}\right)$ second-order oracle calls to find an $(\varepsilon_{0},\varepsilon_{1})$-approximate KKT point. We also introduce an adaptive, feasibility-aware stopping criterion for the subproblems, which relaxes the stationarity tolerance when far from feasibility. This rule preserves all theoretical guarantees while substantially reducing computational effort in practice.</description>

We incorporate financial risk hedging using conditional value at risk (CVaR) within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and propose efficient, exact solution methods for these models. In addition, we introduce a power reliability-oriented risk measure and present new, computationally efficient models for risk-averse grid planning and operations.</description>

      <title>Extended real number arithmetics via Dedekind cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown how Dedekind cuts can be used to introduce the extended real numbers along with sound arithmetic laws via one simple rule for the addition of sets. The crucial idea is that the use of the lower and the upper part of the cuts, respectively, leads to two different additions which are known in the literature as inf-addition and sup-addition. Moreover, the two resulting structures are conlinear spaces which at the same time are complete lattices with respect to the natural order. This admits the definition of pseudo-differences on the extended reals which also provide formulas for expressions like $(+\infty) - (+\infty)$, $(-\infty) - (-\infty)$. There are two major motivations: one is that proper and improper extended real-valued functions can be treated in a unified manner, the other that set-valued functions can often be represented by families of scalar functions which may include improper ones.</description>

      <title>Solving Matrix Games with Even Fewer Matrix-Vector Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium of a two-player, bilinear, zero-sum game with a bounded payoff matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, when the players' strategies are constrained to lie in simple sets. We provide algorithms which solve this problem in $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ matrix-vector multiplies (matvecs) in two well-studied cases: $\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ games, where the players' strategies are both in the probability simplex, and $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ games, where the players' strategies are in the unit Euclidean ball and probability simplex respectively. These results improve upon the previous state-of-the-art complexities of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-8/9})$ for $\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ and of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-7/9})$ for $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ due to [KOS '25]. In particular, our result for $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$, which corresponds to hard-margin support vector machines (SVMs), matches the lower bound of [KS '25] up to polylogarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Disruption Resilience in Intermodal Transport Networks: Integrating Flow Weighting and Centrality Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilient intermodal freight networks are vital for sustaining supply chains amid increasing threats from natural hazards and cyberattacks. While transportation resilience has been widely studied, understanding how random and targeted disruptions affect both structural connectivity and functional performance remains a key challenge. To address this, our study evaluates the robustness of the U.S. intermodal freight network, comprising rail and water modes, using a simulation-based framework that integrates graph-theoretic metrics with flow-weighted centrality measures. We examine disruption scenarios including random failures as well as targeted node and edge removals based on static and dynamically updated degree and betweenness centrality. To reflect more realistic conditions, we also consider flow-weighted degree centralities and partial node degradation. Two resilience indicators are used: the size of the giant connected component (GCC) to measure structural connectivity, and flow-weighted network efficiency (NE) to assess freight mobility under disruption. Results show that progressively degrading nodes ranked by Weighted Degree Centrality to 60% of their original functionality causes a sharper decline in normalized NE, for up to approximately 45 affected nodes, than complete failure (100% loss of functionality) applied to nodes targeted by weighted betweenness centrality or selected at random. This highlights how partial degradation of high-tonnage hubs can produce disproportionately large functional losses. The findings emphasize the need for resilience strategies that go beyond network topology to incorporate freight flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion Analysis of Compressed Query Delegation with Low-Rank Riemannian Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounded-context agents fail when intermediate reasoning exceeds an effective working-memory budget. We study compressed query delegation (CQD): (i) compress a high-dimensional latent reasoning state into a low-rank tensor query, (ii) delegate the minimal query to an external oracle, and (iii) update the latent state via Riemannian optimization on fixed-rank manifolds. We give a math-first formulation: CQD is a constrained stochastic program with a query-budget functional and an oracle modeled as a noisy operator. We connect CQD to classical rate-distortion and information bottleneck principles, showing that spectral hard-thresholding is optimal for a natural constrained quadratic distortion problem, and we derive convergence guarantees for Riemannian stochastic approximation under bounded oracle noise and smoothness assumptions. Empirically, we report (A) a 2,500-item bounded-context reasoning suite (BBH-derived tasks plus curated paradox instances) comparing CQD against chain-of-thought baselines under fixed compute and context; and (B) a human "cognitive mirror" benchmark (N=200) measuring epistemic gain and semantic drift across modern oracles.</description>

      <title>Scalable Data-Driven Reachability Analysis and Control via Koopman Operators with Conformal Coverage Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable reachability-based framework for probabilistic, data-driven safety verification of unknown nonlinear dynamics. We use Koopman theory with a neural network (NN) lifting function to learn an approximate linear representation of the dynamics and design linear controllers in this space to enable closed-loop tracking of a reference trajectory distribution. Closed-loop reachable sets are efficiently computed in the lifted space and mapped back to the original state space via NN verification tools. To capture model mismatch between the Koopman dynamics and the true system, we apply conformal prediction to produce statistically-valid error bounds that inflate the reachable sets to ensure the true trajectories are contained with a user-specified probability. These bounds generalize across references, enabling reuse without recomputation. Results on high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks (11D Hopper, 28D Swimmer) and 12D quadcopters show improved reachable set coverage rate, computational efficiency, and conservativeness over existing methods.</description>

      <title>European Options in Market Models with Multiple Defaults: the BSDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-linear Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) driven by a Brownian motion and p default martingales. The driver of the BSDE with multiple default jumps can take a generalized form involving an optional finite variation process. We first show existence and uniqueness. We then establish comparison and strict comparison results for these BSDEs, under a suitable assumption on the driver. In the case of a linear driver, we derive an explicit formula for the first component of the BSDE using an adjoint exponential semimartingale. The representation depends on whether the finite variation process is predictable or only optional. We apply our results to the problem of pricing and hedging a European option in a linear complete market with two defaultable assets and in a non-linear complete market with p defaultable assets. Two examples of the latter market model are provided: an example where the seller of the option is a large investor influencing the probability of default of a single asset and an example where the large seller's strategy affects the default probabilities of all p assets.</description>

      <title>Towards a Principled Muon under $\mu\mathsf{P}$: Ensuring Spectral Conditions throughout Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\mu$-parameterization ($\mu$P) provides a principled foundation for large language model (LLM) training by prescribing width-independent learning dynamics, which in turn enables predictable scaling behavior and robust hyperparameter transfer across model sizes. A central requirement of $\mu$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $\mu$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $\mu$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $\mu$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $\mu$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training. We also take the first step towards an adaptive spectral condition by incorporating data-dependent effects, making it better suited for long-horizon LLM training.</description>

      <title>GlycoPy: An Equation-Oriented and Object-Oriented Software for Hierarchical Modeling, Optimization, and Control in Python</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing model predictive control (MPC) applications in process industries employ lin-ear models, although real-world (bio)chemical processes are typically nonlinear. The use of linear models limits the performance and applicability of MPC for processes that span a wide range of operating conditions. A challenge in employing nonlinear models in MPC for com-plex systems is the lack of tools that facilitate hierarchical model development, as well as lack of efficient implementations of the corresponding nonlinear MPC (NMPC) algorithms. As a step towards making NMPC more practical for hierarchical systems, we introduce Gly-coPy, an equation-oriented, object-oriented software framework for process modeling, opti-mization, and NMPC in Python. GlycoPy enables users to focus on writing equations for modeling while supporting hierarchical modeling. GlycoPy includes algorithms for parame-ter estimation, dynamic optimization, and NMPC, and allows users to customize the simula-tion, optimization, and control algorithms. Three case studies, ranging from a simple differ-ential algebraic equation system to a multiscale bioprocess model, validate the modeling, optimization, and NMPC capabilities of GlycoPy. GlycoPy has the potential to bridge the gap between advanced NMPC algorithms and their practical application in real-world (bio)chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling of unbounded random stopping times: computing committor functions and exit rates without reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare events in molecular dynamics are often related to noise-induced transitions between different macroscopic states (e.g., in protein folding). A common feature of these rare transitions is that they happen on timescales that are on average exponentially long compared to the characteristic timescale of the system, with waiting time distributions that have (sub)exponential tails and infinite support. As a result, sampling such rare events can lead to trajectories that can be become arbitrarily long, with not too low probability, which makes the reweighting of such trajectories a real challenge. Here, we discuss rare event simulation by importance sampling from a variational perspective, with a focus on applications in molecular dynamics, in particular the computation of committor functions. The idea is to design importance sampling schemes that (a) reduce the variance of a rare event estimator while controlling the average length of the trajectories and (b) that do not require the reweighting of possibly very long trajectories. In doing so, we study different stochastic control formulations for committor and mean first exit times, which we compare both from a theoretical and a computational point of view, including numerical studies of some benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Decentralized Optimization via Overlapping Local Steps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization has emerged as a critical paradigm for distributed learning, enabling scalable training while preserving data privacy through peer-to-peer collaboration. However, existing methods often suffer from communication bottlenecks due to frequent synchronization between nodes. We present Overlapping Local Decentralized SGD (OLDSGD), a novel approach to accelerate decentralized training by computation-communication overlapping, significantly reducing network idle time. With a deliberately designed update, OLDSGD preserves the same average update as Local SGD while avoiding communication-induced stalls. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for smooth non-convex objectives, showing that OLDSGD retains the same iteration complexity as standard Local Decentralized SGD while improving per-iteration runtime. Empirical results demonstrate OLDSGD's consistent improvements in wall-clock time convergence under different levels of communication delays. With minimal modifications to existing frameworks, OLDSGD offers a practical solution for faster decentralized learning without sacrificing theoretical guarantees.</description>

Abstract: Model-based policy optimization is a well-established framework for designing reliable and high-performance controllers across a wide range of control applications. Recently, this approach has been extended to model predictive control policies, where explicit dynamical models are embedded within the control law. However, the performance of the resulting controllers, and the convergence of the associated optimization algorithms, critically depends on the accuracy of the models. In this paper, we demonstrate that combining gradient-based policy optimization with recursive system identification ensures convergence to an optimal controller design and showcase our finding in several control examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal spectral inequalities for Landau operators in full space and in arbitrary dimension. Spectral inequalities are lower bounds on the L 2 -mass of functions in spectral subspaces of finite energy when integrated over a sampling set S $\subset$ R d . Landau operators are Schr{\"o}dinger operators associated with a constant magnetic field of the form (-$\nabla$ + A(x)) 2 where A is a -in case of non-vanishing magnetic field -unbounded vector potential. Our strategy relies on so-called magnetic Bernstein estimates and analyticity, adapting an approach used by Kovrijkine in the context of the Logvinenko-Sereda theorem. We generalize results previously only known in dimension d = 2. The main difficulty in dimension d $\ge$ 3 are the magnetic Bernstein inequalities which, in comparison to the twodimensional case, lead to additional complications and require more delicate estimates. Our results have immediate consequences for control theory, spectral theory and mathematical physics which we comment on.</description>

Abstract: Recent control algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been designed using an implicit analogy with well-established optimization algorithms. In this paper, we adopt the quasi-Newton method (QNM) from convex optimization to introduce a novel control algorithm coined as quasi-policy iteration (QPI). In particular, QPI is based on a novel approximation of the ``Hessian'' matrix in the policy iteration algorithm, which exploits two linear structural constraints specific to MDPs and allows for the incorporation of prior information on the transition probability kernel. While the proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as value iteration, it exhibits an empirical convergence behavior similar to that of QNM with a low sensitivity to the discount factor.</description>

      <title>Computational Guarantees for Restarted PDHG for LP based on "Limiting Error Ratios" and LP Sharpness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14774v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in solving linear optimization problems - or more simply "LP" - using first-order methods in order to avoid the costly matrix factorizations of traditional methods for huge-scale LP instances. The restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method (PDHG) - together with some heuristic techniques - has emerged as a powerful tool for solving huge-scale LPs. However, the theoretical understanding of the restarted PDHG and the validation of various heuristic implementation techniques are still very limited. Existing complexity analyses have relied on the Hoffman constant of the LP KKT system, which is known to be overly conservative, difficult to compute, and fails to offer insight into instance-specific characteristics of the LP problems. These limitations have limited the capability to discern which characteristics of LP instances lead to easy versus difficult instances. With the goal of overcoming these limitations, we introduce and develop two purely geometry-based condition measures for LP instances: "limiting error ratio" and LP sharpness. We provide new computational guarantees for the restarted PDHG based on these two condition measures. For limiting error ratio, we provide a computable upper bound and show its relationship with the data instance's proximity to infeasibility under perturbation. For LP sharpness, we prove its equivalence to the stability of the LP optimal solution set under perturbation of the objective function. Our computational guarantees are validated by constructed instances. Conversely, our computational guarantees validate the practical efficacy of certain heuristic techniques (row preconditioners and step-size tuning) that improve computational performance. Finally, we present computational experiments on LP relaxations from the MIPLIB dataset that demonstrate the promise of various implementation strategies.</description>

      <title>Subsampled Ensemble Can Improve Generalization Tail Exponentially</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble learning is a popular technique to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. It traditionally hinges on the rationale that aggregating multiple weak models can lead to better models with lower variance and hence higher stability, especially for discontinuous base learners. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on ensembling. By selecting the most frequently generated model from the base learner when repeatedly applied to subsamples, we can attain exponentially decaying tails for the excess risk, even if the base learner suffers from slow (i.e., polynomial) decay rates. This tail enhancement power of ensembling applies to base learners that have reasonable predictive power to begin with and is stronger than variance reduction in the sense of exhibiting rate improvement. We demonstrate how our ensemble methods can substantially improve out-of-sample performances in a range of numerical examples involving heavy-tailed data or intrinsically slow rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To leverage prediction models to make optimal scheduling decisions in service systems, we must understand how predictive errors impact congestion due to externalities on the delay of other jobs. Motivated by applications where prediction models interact with human servers (e.g., content moderation), we consider a large queueing system comprising of many single server queues where the class of a job is estimated using a prediction model. By characterizing the impact of mispredictions on congestion cost in heavy traffic, we design an index-based policy that incorporates the predicted class information in a near-optimal manner. Our theoretical results guide the design of predictive models by providing a simple model selection procedure with downstream queueing performance as a central concern, and offer novel insights on how to design queueing systems with AI-based triage. We illustrate our framework on a content moderation task based on real online comments, where we construct toxicity classifiers by finetuning large language models.</description>

      <title>McCormick envelopes in mixed-integer PDE-constrained optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07891v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: McCormick envelopes are a standard tool for deriving convex relaxations of optimization problems that involve polynomial terms. Such McCormick relaxations provide lower bounds, for example, in branch-and-bound procedures for mixed-integer nonlinear programs but have not gained much attention in PDE-constrained optimization so far. This lack of attention may be due to the distributed nature of such problems, which on the one hand leads to infinitely many linear constraints (generally state constraints that may be difficult to handle) in addition to the state equation for a pointwise formulation of the McCormick envelopes and renders bound-tightening procedures that successively improve the resulting convex relaxations computationally intractable.
  We analyze McCormick envelopes for a problem class that is governed by a semilinear PDE involving a bilinearity and integrality constraints. We approximate the nonlinearity by averaging the involved terms over the cells of a partition of the computational domain on which the PDE is defined. This yields convex relaxations that underestimate the original problem up to an a priori error estimate that depends on the mesh size of the discretization. These approximate McCormick relaxations can be improved by means of an optimization-based bound-tightening procedure. We show that their minimizers converge to minimizers to a limit problem with a pointwise formulation of the McCormick envelopes when driving the mesh size to zero.
  We provide a computational example, for which we certify all of our imposed assumptions. The results point to both the potential of the methodology and the gaps in the research that need to be closed.</description>

Abstract: We study the internal non null-controllability properties of the heat equation on 2-dimensional almost-Riemannian manifolds with an interior singularity, and under the assumption that the closure of the control zone does not contain the whole singularity. We show that if locally, around the singularity, the sub-Riemannian metric can be written in a Grushin form, or equivalently the sub-Laplacian writes as a generalized Grushin operator, then, achieving null-controllability requires at least a minimal amount of time. As locally the manifold looks like a rectangular domain, we consequently focus ourselves on the non null-controllability properties of the generalized Grushin-like heat equation on various Euclidean domains.</description>

Such a model captures the desired features of both fuzzy fractional differential inclusions with integral boundary conditions and fractional differential variational inequalities within the same framework. The existence of solutions for such a novel system is obtained under some mild conditions. Moreover, a numerical example is provided to illustrate our abstract results.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Proximal Gradient ADMM for Nonconvex Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Perturbed Proximal Gradient ADMM (PPG-ADMM) framework for solving general nonconvex composite optimization problems, where the objective function consists of a smooth nonconvex term and a nonsmooth weakly convex term for both primal variables.
  Unlike existing ADMM-based methods which necessitate the function associated with the last updated primal variable to be smooth, the proposed PPG-ADMM removes this restriction by introducing a perturbation mechanism, which also helps reduce oscillations in the primal-dual updates, thereby improving convergence stability.
  By employing a linearization technique for the smooth term and the proximal operator for the nonsmooth and weakly convex term, the subproblems have closed-form solutions, significantly reducing computational complexity. The convergence is established through a technically constructed Lyapunov function, which guarantees sufficient descent and has a well-defined lower bound.
  With properly chosen parameters, PPG-ADMM converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point at a sublinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$.
  Furthermore, by appropriately tuning the perturbation parameter $\beta$, it achieves an $\epsilon$-stationary point, providing stronger optimality guarantees. We further apply PPG-ADMM to two practical distributed nonconvex composite optimization problems, i.e., the distributed partial consensus problem and the resource allocation problem. The algorithm operates in a fully decentralized manner without a central coordinating node. Finally, numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of PPG-ADMM, demonstrating its improved convergence performance.</description>

      <title>AdGT: Decentralized Gradient Tracking with Tuning-free Per-Agent Stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT achieves linear convergence to the global optimal solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.</description>

      <title>Constructing Magic Squares: an integer constraint satisfaction problem and a fast approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20017v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic squares are a fascinating mathematical challenge that has intrigued mathematicians for centuries. Given a positive (and possibly large) integer \( n \), one of the main challenges that still remains is to find, within a computational time, a magic square of order \( n \), that is, a square matrix of order \( n \) with unique integers from \( a_{\min} \) to \( a_{\max} \), such that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal equals a constant \( \mathcal{C}(A) \). In this work, we first present an integer constraint satisfaction problem for constructing a magic square of order \( n \). Nonetheless, the solution time of this problem grows exponentially as the order increases. To overcome this limitation, we also propose a that constructs magic squares depending on whether \( n \) is odd, singly even, or doubly even. Moreover, we provide a proof of the correctness of this novel approach. Our numerical results show that our method can construct magic squares of order up to \num{70000} in less than \num{140} seconds, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Burer-Monteiro factorizability of nuclear norm regularized optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between the nuclear norm-regularized minimization problem, which minimizes the sum of a $C^2$ function $h$ and a positive multiple of the nuclear norm, denoted by $f$, and its factorized problem obtained by the Burer-Monteiro technique. We are interested in deriving conditions that ensure every second-order stationary point of the factorized problem corresponds to a global minimizer of $f$, a property we call the $r$-factorizability of $f$ in this paper. Under suitable restricted isometry property (RIP) type assumptions on $h$, we prove the $r$-factorizability of $f$. Moreover, the RIP constant in our paper is tight, in the sense that we can construct concrete examples of $f$ that fail to be $r$-factorizable when the RIP constant is below the threshold. Our technique for constructing such examples is novel and may be of independent interest: specifically, we use a variant of the Von Neumann's trace inequality and relate the existence of such examples to the optimal value of a quadratic program involving the RIP constant, then we explicitly solve this optimization problem to detect all the possible counterexamples.</description>

Abstract: Employing two distinct types of regularization terms, we propose two regularized extragradient methods for solving equilibrium problems on Hadamard manifolds. The sequences generated by these extragradient algorithms converge to a solution of the equilibrium problem without requiring the Lipschitz continuity of the bifunction or imposing additional conditions on the parameters. We establish convergence results for both algorithms and derive global error bounds along with $R$-linear convergence rates in cases where the bifunction is strongly pseudomonotone. Finally, we present numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15735v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Haraux function is an important tool in monotone operator theory and its applications. One of its salient properties for a maximally monotone operator is to be valued in $[0,+\infty]$ and to vanish only on the graph of the operator. Sharper lower bounds for this function have been proposed in specific cases. We derive lower bounds in the general context of set-valued operators in reflexive real Banach spaces. These bounds are new, even for maximally monotone operators acting on Euclidean spaces, a scenario in which we show that they can be better than existing ones. As a by-product, we obtain lower bounds on the Fenchel--Young function in variational analysis. Several examples are given and applications to composite monotone inclusions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note presents a novel and efficient Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme specifically designed for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. To address the stability challenge of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems, a new concept of convergence filters is introduced. Three alternative convergence filters are designed accordingly to be incorporated into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon approach without explicit terminal state constraints is adopted. This design allows for a flexible trade-off among convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden via simple parameter adjustment. Moreover, sufficient conditions are rigorously derived to guarantee recursive feasibility and stability. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated through simulations on a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.</description>

      <title>Convex Formulation of the Maritime Fleet Size and Mix Problem Considering Battery Electric Ships</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of determining a minimum-cost fleet of battery electric ships for a given liner shipping operation. The problem is strongly nonlinear and includes integer-valued decision variables, which make it intractable for most real-world instances. The conventional approach in the literature is to formulate a linear approximation by restricting available ship types to a small number of predetermined alternatives. Contrary to the conventional linearization approach, this paper models the nonlinearities directly. We show that the problem exhibits a hidden convex structure uncovered by changes of variables. Computational experiments show that our convex formulation achieves 15.1\% lower fleet cost on average and reduces the solve time by at least 10x compared to the linear formulation. The solve time advantage is attributed to the elimination of binary variables associated with ship type selection. Our implementation is available at https://users.aalto.fi/~aritari/convex_ESFSMP.html.</description>

      <title>Qualification-free convex analysis via the joint supporting subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In convex analysis, qualification conditions (also termed constraint qualifications) help avoid pathological behavior at domain boundaries. In this work we remove the need for such conditions by localizing to an affine subspace -- the joint supporting subspace -- that contains the feasible region and ensures qualification conditions hold after localization.
  Our theory generalizes Borwein and Wolkowicz's facial reduction beyond conic programs to convex programs of the form $f(x) + g(Ax)$. Intuitively, the joint supporting subspace corresponds to a bilateral facial reduction between any two convex sets. It enables simple qualification-free generalizations for a host of central results of convex analysis. These include: an exact Fenchel-Rockafellar dual; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions; attained infimal convolution for convex conjugates; subdifferential sum and chain rules; and a characterization of the normal cones of the intersection of two convex sets. All generalizations reduce seamlessly to their original formulations when qualification conditions hold.
  We offer a number of characterizations for the joint supporting subspace, one of which is constructive. Our proofs are self-contained, and introduce a novel theoretical framework consisting of nested normals and supporting subspaces, which simultaneously describe both the boundary of convex sets and the lattice of faces.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanations for Integer Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) offer a human-understandable way to explain decisions by identifying specific changes to the input parameters of a base or present model that would lead to a desired change in the outcome. For optimization models, CEs have primarily been studied in limited contexts and little research has been done on CEs for general integer optimization problems. In this work, we address this gap. We first show that the general problem of constructing a CE is $\Sigma_2^p$-complete even for binary integer programs with just a single mutable constraint. Second, we propose solution algorithms for several of the most tractable special cases: (i) mutable objective parameters, (ii) a single mutable constraint, (iii) mutable right-hand-side, and (iv) all input parameters can be modified. We evaluate our approach using classical knapsack problem instances, focusing on cases with mutable constraint parameters. Additionally, we present experiments on the resource constrained shortest path problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper designs a communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithm for optimization problems subject to coupled equality constraints. By means of duality theory, the original problem is reformulated to tackle the coupled equality constraints. Furthermore, compressed communication is employed to enhance efficiency whereas introducing compression errors that degrade the performance. To address this, differential compression techniques with dynamic scaling factors are incorporated into the algorithm design. It is shown that the proposed distributed compressed algorithm achieves linear convergence under different compressors. Numerical results further demonstrate its robust performance under different types of compressors while satisfying the equality constraints.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Exponential Stability Criterion for Integral Difference Equations and Delay Differential Equations in various state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the exponential stability of Integral Difference Equations and Delay Difference Equations, in the usual state space of continuous functions, is equivalent to the location of the roots of its associated characteristic equation strictly in the open left half-plane (see e.g. [16, Chapter 9]). In this paper, we use results from [15, Chapter 4] to show that this characterization still holds for other functional state spaces: Lebesgue spaces, the space of Borel measurable bounded functions, and the space of functions with bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Complete Characterizations of Well-Posedness in Parametric Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides complete characterization of well-posedness for Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems associated with general problems of perturbed composite optimization. Leveraging the property of parabolic regularity for composite models, we show that the second-order subderivative of the cost function reduces to the novel second-order variational function playing a crucial role in the subsequent analysis. This foundational result implies that the strong second-order sufficient condition introduced in this work for the general class of composite optimization problems naturally extends the classical second-order sufficient condition in nonlinear programming. Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption. These insights lead us to multiple equivalent conditions for the major Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of KKT systems, including SOQC combined with the new second-order subdifferential condition and SOQC combined with tilt stability of local minimizers. Furthermore, under $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility, we prove that the Lipschitz-like property of the reference KKT system is equivalent to its strong regularity. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lipschitz-like property is equivalent to the nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian associated with the KKT system under a certain verifiable assumption. These results provide a unified and rigorous framework for analyzing stability and sensitivity of solutions to composite optimization problems, as well as for the design and justification of numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>A first-order method for nonconvex-strongly-concave constrained minimax optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonconvex-strongly-concave constrained minimax problem. Specifically, we propose a first-order augmented Lagrangian method for solving it, whose subproblems are nonconvex-strongly-concave unconstrained minimax problems and suitably solved by a first-order method developed in this paper that leverages the strong concavity structure. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed method achieves an operation complexity of $O(\varepsilon^{-3.5}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$, measured in terms of its fundamental operations, for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution of the constrained minimax problem, which improves the previous best-known operation complexity by a factor of $\varepsilon^{-0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Semismooth Newton Augmented Lagrangian Algorithm for Adaptive Lasso Penalized Least Squares in Semiparametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a partially linear semiparametric regression model containing an unknown regression coefficient, an unknown nonparametric function, and an unobservable Gaussian distributed random error. We focus on the case of simultaneous variable selection and estimation with a divergent number of covariates under the assumption that the regression coefficient is sparse. We consider the applications of the least squares to semiparametric regression and particularly present an adaptive lasso penalized least squares (PLS) method to select the regression coefficient. We note that there are many algorithms for PLS in various applications, but they seem to be rarely used in semiparametric regression. This paper focuses on using a semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian (SSNAL) algorithm to solve the dual of PLS which is the sum of a smooth strongly convex function and an indicator function. At each iteration, there must be a strongly semismooth nonlinear system, which can be solved by semismooth Newton by making full use of the penalized term. We show that the algorithm offers a significant computational advantage, and the semismooth Newton method admits fast local convergence rate. Numerical experiments on simulated and real data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the PLS method and the progressiveness of the SSNAL algorithm.</description>

      <title>Beyond Expectations: Learning with Stochastic Dominance Made Practical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dominance serves as a general framework for modeling a broad spectrum of decision preferences under uncertainty, with risk aversion as one notable example, as it naturally captures the intrinsic structure of the underlying uncertainty, in contrast to simply resorting to the expectations. Despite theoretical appeal, the application of stochastic dominance in machine learning has been scarce, due to the following challenges: $\textbf{i)}$, the original concept of stochastic dominance only provides a $\textit{partial order}$, and therefore, is not amenable to serve as a general optimality criterion; and $\textbf{ii)}$, an efficient computational recipe remains lacking due to the continuum nature of evaluating stochastic dominance.
  In this work, we make the first attempt towards establishing a general framework of learning with stochastic dominance. We first generalize the stochastic dominance concept to enable feasible comparisons between any arbitrary pair of random variables. We next develop a simple and computationally efficient approach for finding the optimal solution in terms of stochastic dominance, which can be seamlessly plugged into many learning tasks. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance as standard risk-neutral strategies and obtains better trade-offs against risk across a variety of applications including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced Regularization in Deep ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with a large number of parameters often do not overfit, owing to implicit regularization that favors \lq good\rq{} networks. Other related and puzzling phenomena include properties of flat minima, saddle-to-saddle dynamics, and neuron alignment. To investigate these phenomena, we study the local geometry of deep ReLU neural networks. We show that, for a fixed architecture, as the weights vary, the image of a sample $X$ forms a set whose local dimension changes. The parameter space is partitioned into regions where this local dimension remains constant. The local dimension is invariant under the natural symmetries of ReLU networks (i.e., positive rescalings and neuron permutations). We establish then that the network's geometry induces a regularization, with the local dimension serving as a key measure of regularity. Moreover, we relate the local dimension to a new notion of flatness of minima and to saddle-to-saddle dynamics. For shallow networks, we also show that the local dimension is connected to the number of linear regions perceived by $X$, offering insight into the effects of regularization. This is further supported by experiments and linked to neuron alignment. Our analysis offers, for the first time, a simple and unified geometric explanation that applies to all learning contexts for these phenomena, which are usually studied in isolation. Finally, we explore the practical computation of the local dimension and present experiments on the MNIST dataset, which highlight geometry-induced regularization in this setting.</description>

      <title>Robust Appointment Scheduling with Waiting Time Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Appointment scheduling problems under uncertainty encounter a fundamental trade-off between cost minimization and customer waiting times. Most existing studies address this trade-off using a weighted sum approach, which puts little emphasis on individual waiting times and, thus, customer satisfaction. In contrast, we study how to minimize total cost while providing waiting time guarantees to all customers. Given box uncertainty sets for service times and no-shows, we introduce the Robust Appointment Scheduling Problem with Waiting Time Guarantees. We show that the problem is NP-hard in general and introduce a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved in reasonable computation time. For special cases, we prove that polynomial-time variants of the well-known Smallest-Variance-First sequencing rule and the Bailey-Welch scheduling rule are optimal. Furthermore, a case study with data from the radiology department of a large university hospital demonstrates that the approach not only guarantees acceptable waiting times but, compared to existing robust approaches, may simultaneously reduce costs incurred by idle time and overtime. This work suggests that limiting instead of minimizing customer waiting times is a win-win solution in the trade-off between customer satisfaction and cost minimization. Additionally, it provides an easy-to-implement and customizable appointment scheduling framework with waiting time guarantees.</description>

      <title>Characterization of decay rates for discrete operator semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a power-bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space $X$, and let $S$ be a bounded linear operator from another Hilbert space $Y$ to $X$. We investigate the non-exponential rate of decay of $\|T^nS\|$ as $n \to \infty$. First, when $X = Y$ and $S$ commutes with $T$, we characterize the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ in terms of the growth rate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$ as $|\lambda| \downarrow 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Next, we provide another characterization by means of an integral estimate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$. The second characterization is then applied to asymptotic estimates for perturbed discrete operator semigroups. Finally, we present some results on the relation between the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ and the boundedness of the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\|T^nSy\|^p$ for all $y \in Y$ in the Banach space setting, where $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to(0,\infty)$ and $p \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) power many modern applications, but their inference procedure poses unique scheduling challenges: the Key-Value (KV) cache grows dynamically during response generation, and memory overflow triggers eviction that can cascade into system-wide failures. Even when memory capacity exceeds the theoretical requirement, conventional scheduling algorithms fail because they do not account for this dynamic memory growth -- a system that should be stable can become unstable under poor scheduling.
  This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to establish a tractable benchmark and derive the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm. WAIT uses threshold-based batching to prevent eviction by keeping the system near load balance, achieving near-optimal throughput when output lengths are known.
  For practical settings where output lengths are unknown at arrival, we introduce Nested WAIT. Rather than predicting output lengths, Nested WAIT classifies prompts on-the-fly: short prompts complete early and exit, while longer prompts naturally advance to later segments. A safety buffer provides high-probability protection against memory overflow with only logarithmic overhead.
  Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal performance in the asymptotic regime. Experiments on Llama-7B with an A100 GPU demonstrate that our approach achieves superior throughput and reduced latency compared to vLLM and Sarathi. This work applies operations research principles to establish a theoretical framework for LLM deployment under memory constraints.</description>

      <title>A data-driven framework for team selection in Fantasy Premier League</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Under a fixed budget, managers select squads to maximize future Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points. This study formulates lineup selection as data-driven optimization and develops deterministic and robust mixed-integer linear programs that choose the starting eleven, bench, and captain under budget, formation, and club-quota constraints (maximum three players per club). The objective is parameterized by a hybrid scoring metric that combines realized FPL points with predictions from a linear regression model trained on match-performance features identified using exploratory data analysis techniques. The study benchmarks alternative objectives and cost estimators, including simple and recency-weighted averages, exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Monte Carlo simulation. Experiments on the 2023/24 Premier League season show that ARIMA with a constrained budget and a rolling window yields the most consistent out-of-sample performance; weighted averages and Monte Carlo are also competitive. Robust variants and hybrid scoring metrics improve some objectives but are not uniformly superior. The framework provides transparent decision support for fantasy roster construction and extends to FPL chips, multi-week rolling-horizon transfer planning, and week-by-week dynamic captaincy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of a time-dependent variational mean field game system with local couplings and either periodic or Neumann boundary conditions. Following a variational approach, we employ a finite difference discretization and solve the resulting finite-dimensional optimization problem using the Chambolle--Pock primal--dual algorithm. As this involves computing proximal operators and solving ill-conditioned linear systems at each iteration, we embed within our solver a general class of parallel-in-time preconditioners based on suitably-chosen diagonalization techniques, applied using discrete Fourier transforms. These enable efficient, scalable iterative solvers for each linear system, with robustness across a wide range of viscosities. We further develop fast solvers for the resulting ill-conditioned systems arising at each time step, using exact recursive schemes for structured grids while allowing for other geometries. Numerical experiments confirm the improved performance and parallel scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Linear Behavior in Large-Scale Dynamical Systems via Spatial Averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, can be described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for Quantum State Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an indispensable tool for characterizing many-body quantum systems. However, due to the exponential scaling of the cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), an algorithmic framework for sparse signal recovery, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large sparse recovery problems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction error by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation. Our work advances the state of low-rank QST and may be applicable to other quantum tomography protocols.</description>

      <title>Auditing Human Decision-Making in High-Stakes Environments via Prescriptive AI: A Stress-Test on Real-Time Tactical Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-stakes decision-making is often compromised by cognitive biases and outcome dependency. Current AI models typically mimic historical human behavior, inheriting these biases and limiting their utility for normative improvement. Here, we introduce a Prescriptive AI framework designed to audit, rather than automate, human judgment in real-time environments. By decoupling decision quality from stochastic outcomes, we quantify "decision latency" and status quo bias in elite soccer management - a high-pressure adversarial domain. Analyzing 2018 FIFA World Cup data, our system exposes critical risk states, such as performance collapse following salient positive events (e.g., an assist), which human experts systematically overlook due to outcome bias. These findings demonstrate that interpretable auditing systems can reveal structural flaws in human reasoning that predictive models obscure.
