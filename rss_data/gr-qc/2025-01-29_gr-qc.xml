      <title>Dynamics of test particles and scalar perturbations around Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a black hole coupled with cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion and scalar perturbations of the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CS). By employing the effective potential approach, we analyze the trajectories of massless and massive test particles around this regular BH solution. The interplay between nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and CS significantly modifies the spacetime geometry, resulting in distinct dynamical properties for test particles. The behavior of null and timelike geodesics, including their stability and escape conditions, is thoroughly examined. In addition to the geodesic analysis, we study scalar perturbations by deriving the Klein-Gordon equation for massless scalar fields in this spacetime. The resulting Schr\"odinger-like wave equation reveals an effective potential that depends intricately on the NLED and CS parameters. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factors (GFs) to explore the energy transmission and absorption properties of theBH. Our results demonstrate that the NLED parameter $g$ and the CS parameter $\alpha$ play pivotal roles in modulating the GFs, influencing the energy spectrum of scalar radiation. These results provide significant understanding of the observational characteristics of the ABG NLED-CS BH in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors, reflectionless scattering modes, and echoes of ultracompact horizonless objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently discovered connection between the greybody factors of black holes and the ringdown signal, we investigate the greybody factors of ultracompact horizonless objects, also elucidating their connection to echoes. The greybody factor of ultracompact objects features both low-frequency resonances and high-frequency, quasi-reflectionless scattering modes, which become purely reflectionless in the presence of symmetric cavity potentials, as it might be the case for a wormhole. We show that it is these high-frequency (quasi-)reflectionless scattering modes, rather than low-frequency resonances, to be directly responsible for the echoes in the time-domain response of ultracompact objects or of black holes surrounded by matter fields localized at large distances.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Neural Network Surrogate Models: Application to Black Hole Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate models of numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes provide the most accurate tools for gravitational-wave data analysis. Neural network-based surrogates promise evaluation speedups, but their accuracy relies on (often obscure) tuning of settings such as the network architecture, hyperparameters, and the size of the training dataset. We propose a systematic optimization strategy that formalizes setting choices and motivates the amount of training data required. We apply this strategy on NRSur7dq4Remnant, an existing surrogate model for the properties of the remnant of generically precessing binary black hole mergers and construct a neural network version, which we label NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN. The systematic optimization strategy results in a new surrogate model with comparable accuracy, and provides insights into the meaning and role of the various network settings and hyperparameters as well as the structure of the physical process. Moreover, NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN results in evaluation speedups of up to $8$ times on a single CPU and a further improvement of $2,000$ times when evaluated in batches on a GPU. To determine the training set size, we propose an iterative enrichment strategy that efficiently samples the parameter space using much smaller training sets than naive sampling. NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN requires $O(10^4)$ training data, so neural network-based surrogates are ideal for speeding-up models that support such large training datasets, but at the moment cannot directly be applied to numerical relativity catalogs that are $O(10^3)$ in size. The optimization strategy is available through the gwbonsai package.</description>

      <title>The Regular Ricci-Inverse Cosmology with Multiple Anticurvature Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the modified gravity in which the Lagrangian of gravity is a function of the trace of the n-th matrix power of Ricci tensor in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW) spacetime. When n is negative, the inverse of Ricci tensor, also called the anticurvature tensor, will be introduced. We design a new class of Ricci-inverse theory containing two anticurvature scalars and resulting to be free from the singularity problem.</description>

      <title>Statistical biases in parameterized searches for gravitational-wave polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tests of gravity using gravitational waves (GWs), GW events analyzed are often selected based on specific criteria, particularly the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, such event selection can introduce bias into parameter estimation unless the selection effect is appropriately taken into account in the analysis. In this paper, we investigate how event selection with certain prior information affects parameter inference within the scalar-tensor polarization framework, focusing on the measurement of the scalar mode amplitude parameters. We find that for the Tensor+Scalar(dipole) model, the amplitude of the scalar dipole radiation is overestimated when its true value is nonzero while there is no false deviation in the absence of the scalar mode. The same bias is expected to occur also for the Tensor+Scalar(quadrupole) model. However, error typically exceeds the bias as the scalar quadrupole mode is difficult to be distinguished from the tensor mode.</description>

      <title>Dipolar perturbations of nonbidiagonal black holes in bigravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bimetric gravity, nonbidiagonal solutions describing a static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole are given by a pair of Schwarzschild geometries, one in each metric sector. The two geometries are linked by a nontrivial diffeomorphism, which can be fully determined analytically if the two geometries possess the same isometries. This exact solution depends on four free parameters: the mass parameters of the two black holes, the ratio between the areal radii of the two metrics, and the proportionality constant between their (appropriately normalized) time-translation invariance Killing vector fields. We study the dynamics of axial dipolar perturbations on such a background and obtain general analytical solutions for their evolution. We show that, in general, the characteristic curves followed by dipolar gravitational waves are spacelike with respect to both metrics, and thus the propagation is superluminal. In fact, the velocity of a pulse, as measured by a static observer, turns out to increase with the distance to the black hole. The only exception to this general behavior corresponds to the special case where the two proportionality constants linking the areal radii and the Killing vectors coincide, for which waves travel at the speed of light. Therefore, we conclude that this is the only physically reasonable background, and thus our results restrict the class of viable black-hole solutions in bimetric gravity.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dual cascade in gravitational wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically simulate, in both the forced and decay regimes, a fourth-order nonlinear diffusion equation derived from the kinetic equation of gravitational wave turbulence in the limit of strongly local quartic interactions. When a forcing is applied to an intermediate wavenumber $k_i$, we observe a dual cascade of energy and wave action. In the stationary state, the associated flux ratio is proportional to $k_i$, and the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra are recovered. In decaying turbulence, the study reveals that the wave action spectrum can extend to wavenumbers greater than the initial excitation $k_i$ with constant negative flux, while the energy flux is positive with a power law dependence in $k$. This leads to an unexpected result: a single inertial range with a Kolmogorov-Zakharov wave action spectrum extending progressively to wavenumbers larger than $k_i$. We also observe a wave action decay in time in $t^{-1/3}$ while the front of the energy spectrum progresses according to a $t^{1/3}$ law. These properties can be understood with simple theoretical arguments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and squeezing of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the self-interactions present in the effective field theory formulation of general relativity can couple gravitational wave modes and generate nonclassical states. The output of gravitational nonlinear processes can also be sensitive to quantum features of the input states, indicating that nonlinearities can act both as sources and detectors of quantum features of gravitational waves. Due to gauge and quantization issues in strongly curved spacetimes, we work in the geometric optics limit of gravitational radiation, but we expect the key ideas extend to situations of astrophysical interest. This offers a new direction for probing the quantum nature of gravity, analogous to how the quantumness of electrodynamics was established through quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Domain Walls Biased by Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the simplest standard model extensions leading to a domain wall network is a real scalar $S$ with a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry spontaneously broken during universe evolution. Motivated by the swampland program, we explore the possibility that quantum gravity effects are responsible for violation of the discrete symmetry, triggering the annihilation of the domain wall network. We explore the resulting cosmological implications in terms of dark radiation, dark matter, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, and wormholes connected to baby universes.</description>

      <title>Tackling artefacts in the timing of relativistic pulsar binaries: towards the SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common signal-processing approximations produce artefacts when timing pulsars in relativistic binary systems, especially edge-on systems with tight orbits, such as the Double Pulsar. In this paper, we use extensive simulations to explore various patterns that arise from the inaccuracies of approximations made when correcting dispersion and Shapiro delay. In a relativistic binary, the velocity of the pulsar projected onto the line-of-sight varies significantly on short time scales, causing rapid changes in the apparent pulsar spin frequency, which is used to convert dispersive delays to pulsar rotational phase shifts. A well-known example of the consequences of this effect is the artificial variation of dispersion measure (DM) with binary phase, first observed in the Double Pulsar 20 years ago. We show that ignoring the Doppler shift of the spin frequency when computing the dispersive phase shift exactly reproduces the shape and magnitude of the reported DM variations. We also simulate and study two additional effects of much smaller magnitude, which are caused by the assumption that the spin frequency used to correct dispersion is constant over the duration of the sub-integration and over the observed bandwidth. We show that failure to account for these two effects leads to orbital phase-dependent dispersive smearing that leads to apparent orbital DM variations. The functional form of the variation depends on the orbital eccentricity. In addition, we find that a polynomial approximation of the timing model is unable to accurately describe the Shapiro delay of edge-on systems with orbits less than 4 hours, which poses problems for the measurements of timing parameters, most notably the Shapiro delay. This will be a potential issue for sensitive facilities like the FAST and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA); therefore, a more accurate phase predictor is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave inference of star cluster properties from intermediate-mass black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will observe mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) out to high redshift. Such IMBHs can form through runaway tidal encounters in the cores of dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we ask if the gravitational wave observation of a single merger event between two IMBHs, occurring in the aftermath of the coalescence of the clusters in which they formed, can be used to infer the properties of their host clusters, such as mass, redshift, and half-mass radius. We implement an astrophysically motivated analytic model for cluster evolution and IMBH growth, and we perform IMBH binary parameter estimation using a network of three next-generation detectors. We find that inferring the structural properties of clusters in this way is challenging due to model degeneracy. However, the posteriors on the cluster formation redshifts have relatively narrow peaks, and it may still be possible to infer the cluster formation history by measuring a whole population of IMBH binary merger events.</description>

      <title>A new look at multi-gravity and dimensional deconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been understood that certain theories of ghost free massive gravity and their multi-graviton extensions can be thought of as arising from a higher dimensional theory of gravity, upon discretising the extra dimension. However, this correspondence between standard multi-gravity and extra dimensional gravity holds only when one discretises the extra dimension after gauge fixing the lapse function associated to the various lower dimensional hypersurfaces. The lapse provides crucial structure to the extra dimensional theory: in pure general relativity (GR), it ensures full diffeomorphism invariance of the theory, and enforces its Hamiltonian constraint. Thus, upon deconstruction, important information related to the extra dimension is missing in the resulting multi-gravity theory; as a result one could never hope to recover higher dimensional GR in its entirety upon taking the appropriate continuum limit. Here, we develop an improved deconstruction procedure that maintains the free lapse, and show that the resulting deconstructed theory is essentially multi-gravity equipped with additional dynamical scalar fields, whose field equations encode the Hamiltonian constraint in the extra dimensional theory. As an example, we explicitly demonstrate that - with an FLRW ansatz for the metrics in this new theory - one may recover all of the equations and constraints of 5-dimensional brane cosmology upon taking the continuum limit. We then treat the deconstructed theory as an entity in its own right, and generalise it to arbitrary dimension and interaction structures beyond those admitting a well-defined continuum limit. We dub this theory `scalar-tensor multi-gravity', and show that the new scalar equations change the structure of some simple solutions that were previously allowed in standard multi-gravity, in a manner that exactly mirrors what we expect from higher dimensional GR.</description>

      <title>Mass gap in non-perturbative quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity via Dyson-Schwinger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply in a simple model derived from quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity the technique of Dyson-Schwinger equations to solve for its corresponding quantum theory. Particularly, we solve the classical equations of motion to get a solution to the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger equations in the limit of large coupling. The model is obtained by looking for conformally flat solutions. The model admits Higgs-like solutions with a single particle having a finite mass. Assuming a Fubini-Lipatov instanton for the vacuum instead, the spectrum is given by an infinite set of excitations of finite mass. In both cases, the model develops a mass gap due to the presence of the quadratic Ricci scalar, after the breaking of the conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Bulk Flow Analysis in Modified Gravity Theories: $f(R)$ and Perturbed $f(R)$ Models with Neutrino Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the characteristics of bulk flow across various redshift ranges within the frameworks of $f(R)$ gravity, perturbed $f(R)$ gravity, and perturbed $f(R)$ gravity coupled with neutrinos. Our investigation reveals profound insights into large-scale cosmic flows and their interactions with major cosmic structures, such as the Sloan Great Wall (SGW) and the King Ghidorah Supercluster (KGSc). We find that incorporating neutrinos into the perturbed $f(R)$ gravity model results in a substantial increase in bulk flow velocities across all redshifts, with notable enhancements in the higher redshift ranges, where velocities can exceed $3000 \, \mathrm{km/s}$ in the $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.4$ range. Moreover, the direction of the bulk flow in this model closely aligns with the dark energy dipole, especially at redshifts $z &gt; 0.4$, showing near-perfect congruence with cosmic superclusters. This suggests a significant interaction between neutrinos and cosmic structures, influencing cosmic acceleration. At lower redshifts, such as $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2$, the bulk flow aligns with the SGW, while in the $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$ range, it aligns with the KGSc. In the low redshift range $0.001 &lt; z &lt; 0.016$, although velocities are lower, neutrinos still subtly increase the bulk flow velocity and maintain alignment with nearby cosmic structures, like the Local Supercluster. Our results underscore the critical role of neutrinos in shaping cosmic flows and offer new insights into the interplay between dark energy, neutrinos, and modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>The thermal index of neutron-star matter in the virial approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by gravitational wave observations of binary neutron-star mergers, we study the thermal index of low-density, high-temperature dense matter. We use the virial expansion to account for nuclear interaction effects. We focus on the region of validity of the expansion, which reaches $10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$ at $T=5$ MeV up to almost saturation density at $T=50$ MeV. In pure neutron matter, we find an analytical expression for the thermal index, and show that it is nearly density- and temperature-independent, within a fraction of a percent of the non-interacting, non-relativistic value of $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$. When we incorporate protons, electrons and photons, we find that the density and temperature dependence of the thermal index changes significantly. We predict a smooth transition between an electron-dominated regime with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 4/3$ at low densities to a neutron-dominated region with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$ at high densities. This behavior is by and large independent of proton fraction and is not affected by nuclear interactions in the region where the virial expansion converges. We model this smooth transition analytically and provide a simple but accurate parametrization of the inflection point between these regimes. When compared to tabulated realistic models of the thermal index, we find an overall agreement at high temperatures that weakens for colder matter. The discrepancies can be attributed to the missing contributions of nuclear clusters. The virial approximation provides a clear and physically intuitive framework for understanding the thermal properties of dense matter, offering a computationally efficient solution that makes it particularly well-suited for the regimes relevant to neutron star binary remnants.</description>

      <title>Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. Recent observations, e.g. DESI, have shown that the sound horizon-independent measurement of $H_0$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. On the one hand, imposing some prior from other cosmological probes is often used to strengthen the constraints on the results, however, these priors are usually derived using the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM, it is not suitable to apply these so-called $\Lambda$CDM priors (e.g., the $n_s$ prior from CMB), which would bias the results, to early new physics because these early new physics are usually accompanied by shifts of the $\Lambda$CDM parameters. On the other hand, the constraints on $H_0$ in the sound horizon-independent EFTofLSS analysis arise from not only the shape of the power spectrum ($k_\text{eq}$-based $H_0$), but also the overall amplitude (when combined with CMB lensing observations) and the relative amplitudes of the BAO wiggles, thus besides $k_\text{eq}$ other information may also play a role in constraining $H_0$. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty ruling out early new physics.</description>

      <title>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter presents Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the proposal that, below a certain acceleration scale $a_0$, dynamics departs from the Newtonian expectation. In that context, the determining factor for the emergence of apparent missing matter in galactic systems is predicted to be the acceleration, and not the mass or size of the system. MOND enables, for example, the prediction of rotation curves from only the baryonic distribution of galaxies. The simple rule is that the acceleration observed in the low-acceleration regime is the square root of the Newtonian expectation times $a_0$. Immediately, the flatness of rotation curves follows, as well as the proportionality of the fourth power of the asymptotic circular speed to only the baryonic mass of the galaxy. While the asymptotic circular speed is predicted not to depend on the baryonic surface density of galaxies of fixed baryonic mass, the inner shape of rotation curves is predicted to strongly depend on it. More generally, MOND implies an algebraic relation between the acceleration expected from Newtonian gravity and the total observed acceleration, at any radius in a galaxy. This is known, observationally, as the Radial Acceleration Relation. For galaxy clusters, it is commonly accepted that MOND fails, needing a stronger gravitational force (or more baryonic mass than observed) to account for the thermodynamic state of galaxy clusters, their lensing and kinematics. MOND, however, is not a complete theory, but a phenomenological non-relativistic paradigm in the limit of low accelerations, in need of embedding in a more fundamental theory. While various non-relativistic field theories of MOND exist, the search for a relativistic theory that recovers general relativity for high accelerations and MOND for low accelerations in the quasi-static limit, as well as a cosmology compatible with observations, is still on-going.</description>

      <title>Observing Hot Holographic Quark Star With Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the equation of state for hot quark matter from a holographic $2+1$ flavor QCD model, which could form the core of a stable compact star. By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies and we obtain stable stars with the maximum mass of around 23 to 30 solar masses, and the compactness around $0.1$. The I-Love-Q-C relations are further discussed, and compared with the neutron star cases. These compact stars are candidates for black hole mimickers, which could be observed by gravitational waves and distinguished by properties like nonzero tidal Love number and electromagnetic signals.</description>

      <title>The interaction of neutrinos with Phantom, Quintessence, and Quintum scalar fields and its effect on the formation of structures in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the fact that the mass of the neutrinos is so small, they are produced in such vast numbers in the early Universe that their mass induces subtle effects on cosmological observables, primarily the growth of structure and the expansion history in the Universe. We consider the models where neutrino interacts with dark energy scalar field models; phantom, quintessence, and quintom. Also, we obtained the $z_{\rm nr}$ (the redshift at which a mass of neutrino $m_{\nu}$ will become non-relativistic) and surveyed the effect of non-relativistic neutrinos on the structure formation. The data used in this paper are Pantheon + Analysis catalog, CMB, and BAO data. We obtained coupling constant $\beta$ for neutrino and three scalar fields and found that larger $\beta$ values will generally lead to larger neutrino mass in the Universe. For combination data, we found that the total mass of neutrino $\sum m_{\nu}&lt; 0.1197$eV $(95\% $ Confidence Level (C.L.) for quintom model and $\sum m_{\nu}&lt; 0.121 $eV $(95\% $ Confidence Level (C.L.) for phantom model and $\sum m_{\nu}&lt; 0.122$eV $(95\% $ Confidence Level (C.L.) for quintessence model. These results are in broad agreement with the results of Planck 2018 where the total neutrino mass is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.12$eV ($95\%$ C.L., TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing+BAO). Using the neutrino mass obtained from different models, we calculated $z_{\rm nr}$ and co-moving wave number $k_{\rm nr}$ and showed that neutrinos played a role on the structure formation in the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: The recently reported signal of common red noise between pulsars by several pulsar timing array collaborations has been thought as evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) due to the Helling-Downs correlation. In this Letter, we search for the non-Gaussianity of SGWB through its non-linear effect on the overlap reduction function in NANOGrav 15-year data set. In particular, we focus on a folded component to SGWB whose amplitude is quantified with a single parameter $\alpha$ in the unpolarized case. The resulting Bayes factor of $1.68 \pm 0.01$ ($1.78 \pm 0.01$ in the case of signals from SMBHBs) indicates that there is no evidence of such a non-Gaussianity of SGWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data yet. If it is detected in future PTA experiments, it will impact our understanding on the origin of the detected SGWB.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Gravitational Wave Bounds from Galactic Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Frequency Gravitational Waves (HFGWs) constitute a unique window on the early Universe as well as exotic astrophysical objects. If the current gravitational wave experiments are more dedicated to the low frequency regime, the graviton conversion into photons in a strong magnetic field constitutes a powerful tool to probe HFGWs. In this paper, we show that neutron stars, due to their extreme magnetic field, are a perfect laboratory to study the conversion of HFGWs into photons. Using realistic models for the galactic neutron star population, we calculate for the first time the expected photon flux induced by the conversion of an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background in the magnetosphere of the ensemble of neutron stars present in the Milky Way. We compare this photon flux to the observed one from several telescopes and derive upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave background in the frequency range $10^8 \, \rm Hz$ - $10^{25}\, \rm Hz$. We find our limits to be competitive in the frequency range $10^8 \, \rm Hz$ - $10^{15}\, \rm Hz$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic Gravity supplements the Einstein-Hilbert action by terms quadratic in the spacetime curvature. This leads to a rich phase space of static, compact gravitating objects including the Schwarzschild black hole, wormholes, and naked singularities. For the first time, we study the collapse of a spherically symmetric star with uniform dust density in this setting. We assume that the interior geometry respects the symmetries of the matter configuration, i.e., homogeneity and isotropy, thus it is insensitive to the Weyl-squared term and the interior dynamics is fully determined by $R$ and $R^2$. As our main result, we find that the collapse leads to the formation of a horizon, implying that the endpoint of a uniform dust collapse with a homogeneous and isotropic interior is not a horizonless spacetime. We also show that the curvature-squared contribution is responsible for making the collapse into a singularity faster than the standard Oppenheimer-Snyder scenario. Furthermore, the junction conditions connecting spacetime inside and outside the matter distribution are found to be significantly more constraining than their counterparts in General Relativity and we discuss key properties of any exterior solution matching to the spacetime inside the collapsing star. Finally, we comment on the potentially non-generic behavior entailed by our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics in extremal Kerr-Newman black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the null geodesics in the extremal Kerr-Newman exterior. We clarify the roots of the radial potential and obtain the parameter space of the azimuthal angular momentum and the Carter constant of the light rays for varieties of the orbits. It is known that one of the unique features of extremal black holes for the null geodesics is the existence of the stable double root at the horizon, giving rise to the stable spherical motion. For the black hole's spin $a&lt;M/2$, the stable double root is isolated from the unstable one. However, for $ a\ge M/2$, the unstable and stable double roots merge at the triple root so that the unstable double root in some parameter region can lie at the horizon, giving a very different shape to the light ring. We then find the analytical expressions of light orbits, which can reach spatial infinity for both nonequatorial and equatorial motions. In particular, for the orbits starting from the near horizon of the extremal Kerr-Newman black holes with the parameters for the unstable double and triple roots, the solutions are remarkably simple in terms of elementary functions. It is also found that the analytical solutions of the equatorial motion can shed light on the deflection of the light by black holes. Varying the azimuthal angular momentum, as either the double or triple root at the horizon is approached from the turning point, the stronger power-law divergence in the deflection angle is found in comparison with the typical logarithmic divergence in nonextremal black holes in the strong deflection limit. This could be another interesting effect of light deflection by extremal black holes.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed derivation of the spectral density of the stochastic background generated by the superposition of coalescing compact binaries. We show how the expression often used in the literature emerges from an average over the extrinsic parameters of the binaries (times of arrival, polarization angles, arrival directions and orbit inclinations) and how the Stokes parameters related to circular and linear polarization are set to zero by such averaging procedure. We then consider the effect of shot noise, i.e. the fact that for the superposition of a finite number of sources these averages are only approximate, and we show how it generates circular and linear polarizations (even for isotropic backgrounds) as well as spatial anisotropies, and we compute them explicitly for a realistic population of binary black holes and binary neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is being developed by ESA with NASA participation. As it has recently passed the Mission Adoption milestone, models of the instruments and noise performance are becoming more detailed, and likewise prototype data analyses must as well. Assumptions such as Gaussianity, stationarity, and data continuity are unrealistic, and must be replaced with physically motivated data simulations, and data analysis methods adapted to accommodate such likely imperfections. To this end, the LISA Data Challenges have produced datasets featuring time-varying and unequal constellation armlength, and measurement artifacts including data interruptions and instrumental transients. In this work, we assess the impact of these data artifacts on the inference of Galactic Binary and Massive Black Hole properties. Our analysis shows that the treatment of noise transients and gaps is necessary for effective parameter estimation, as they substantially corrupt the analysis if unmitigated. We find that straightforward mitigation techniques can significantly if imperfectly suppress artifacts. For the Galactic Binaries, mitigation of glitches was essentially total, while mitigations of the data gaps increased parameter uncertainty by approximately 10%. For the Massive Black Hole binaries the particularly pernicious glitches resulted in a 30% uncertainty increase after mitigations, while the data gaps can increase parameter uncertainty by up to several times. Critically, this underlines the importance of early detection of transient gravitational waves to ensure they are protected from planned data interruptions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Faraday Holonomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closed optical trajectories in Kerr spacetime are engineered to exhibit a marked lack of symmetry. The eccentricity manifests as a holonomy in gravitational Faraday rotation that can be made arbitrarily large by radial translation of the common location of source and receiver. All trajectories are non-equatorial and include a passage through the equatorial plane at the radial turning point, where the trajectory and pseudo-magnetic field are well-aligned. This, combined with path asymmetry, results in a large gravitational Faraday holonomy that lends itself to experimental measurement. Trajectories that start further away from the singularity pass more closely to the ergosphere, thus transiting a more distorted region of spacetime with concomitant amplification of gravitational Coriolis force.</description>

      <title>Probing the Unstable Spectrum of Schwarzschild-like Black Holes</title>

Abstract: We investigate the pseudospectrum of a Schwarzschild-like spacetime within the framework of black hole perturbation theory to analyze a counterintuitive assertion regarding the instability of quasinormal modes. Recent findings suggest that random perturbations to the effective potential associated with gravitational waves may enhance the stability of the underlying wave operator, thereby yielding a stable spectrum of randomly displaced quasinormal modes. Given the unphysical nature of such random perturbations, this work examines these findings within a spacetime that inherently exhibits a perturbed quasinormal spectrum. We find that, in contrast to the QNM spectrum of the Schwarzschild spacetime under random perturbations, the quasinormal spectrum of a Schwarzschild-like black hole deformed through a physically motivated implementation of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametrization is unstable. In particular, we show that the pseudospectra of these Schwarzschild-like black holes do not display the typical features associated with wave operators that yield stable quasinormal spectra. We corroborate our findings by computing the quasinormal spectra when additional (ad-hoc) deformations are added to the effective potential of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko black hole. We also argue that when multiple perturbation sources are present, identifying the origin of the instability may be difficult.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation Model with Small Non-Minimal Coupling Constant</title>

Abstract: In the "Higgs field+gravity" model, the selfconsistency of equations obtained from the original action has the form of an algebraic constraint defining the scalar $\zeta$ as a function of the Higgs field $\varphi$ and its first derivatives. The scalar $\zeta$ is present in all equations of motion and has a significant effect on the dynamics. Transition to the Einstein frame is carried out in equations of motions. Due to the constraint, the original model parameters are converted into $\varphi$-dependent classical effective parameters. In particular, the effective potential has the form $U_{eff}=\frac{\lambda}{4\xi^2}M_P^4 F(\varphi) \tanh^4(\frac{\sqrt{\xi}\varphi}{M_P})$, where $F(\varphi)$ is a smooth function. The constant $\xi$ of non-minimal coupling to scalar curvature can be chosen as small as desired. If $\xi =1/6$, then to ensure agreement with CMB observational data, the Higgs field selfcoupling parameter $\lambda$ in the original action must be of the order of $\sim 10^{-11}$. During cosmological evolution after the end of inflation, the decrease of $\varphi$ leads to a change in the sign of the effective Higgs mass term. This effect provides an answer to the mystery of the Higgs potential structure and leads to SSB. As $\varphi$ approaches VEV, the scalar function $\zeta(\varphi)$ changes in such a way that the classical effective selfcoupling parameter $\lambda_{eff}(\zeta(\varphi))$ increases by 10 orders of magnitude compared to $\lambda$, which is necessary for the implementation of the GWS theory. Applying the model to the very beginning of the classical evolution of the Universe shows that under certain initial conditions, cosmological dynamics can begin with a phantom regime preceding inflation.However, if evolution begins with normal dynamics, then it proceeds only as inflation, and the problem of initial conditions for the onset of inflation does not arise.</description>

      <title>Black Hole from Entropy Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00602v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields. For highly-excited spherically-symmetric static configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution in Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to a speculative view that the configuration represents a quantum-gravitational condensate in a semi-classical manner.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Wormholes from Domain Wall Networks</title>

Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) are topological defects originating from phase transitions in the early universe. In the presence of an energy imbalance between distinct vacua, enclosed DW cavities shrink until the entire network disappears. By studying the dynamics of thin-shell bubbles in General Relativity, we demonstrate that closed DWs with sizes exceeding the cosmic horizon tend to annihilate later than the average. This delayed annihilation allows for the formation of large overdensities, which, upon entering the Hubble horizon, eventually collapse to form Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We rely on 3D percolation theory to calculate the number density of these late-annihilating DWs, enabling us to infer the abundance of PBHs. A key insight from our study is that DW networks with the potential to emit observable Gravitational Waves are also likely to yield detectable PBHs. Additionally, we find that wormholes connected to baby-universes can be produced and conclude on the possibility to generate a multiverse.</description>

Abstract: We study the static patch of de Sitter space in the presence of a timelike boundary. We impose that the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, $K$, are fixed at the boundary. We present the thermodynamic structure of de Sitter space subject to these boundary conditions, for static and spherically symmetric configurations to leading order in the semiclassical approximation. In three spacetime dimensions, and taking $K$ constant on a toroidal Euclidean boundary, we find that the spacetime is thermally stable for all $K$. In four spacetime dimensions, the thermal stability depends on the value of $K$. It is established that for sufficiently large $K$, the de Sitter static patch subject to conformal boundary conditions is thermally stable. This contrasts the Dirichlet problem for which the region encompassing the cosmological horizon has negative specific heat. We present an analysis of the linearised Einstein equations subject to conformal boundary conditions. In the worldline limit of the timelike boundary, the underlying modes are linked to the quasinormal modes of the static patch. In the limit where the timelike boundary approaches the cosmological event horizon, the linearised modes are interpreted in terms of the shear and sound modes of a fluid dynamical system. Additionally, we find modes with a frequency of positive imaginary part. Measured in a local inertial reference frame, and taking the stretched cosmological horizon limit, these modes grow at most polynomially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If entanglement builds spacetime, then conversely, disentanglement ought to destroy spacetime. From the quantum null energy condition and quantum focusing conjecture, we obtain disentanglement criteria which necessitate infinite energies and strong spacetime singularities. We apply our results to the strong cosmic censorship proposal, where singularities at the Cauchy horizons in black holes are desirable. Using our disentanglement criteria and without resorting to any detailed calculations, we provide an exceedingly general and physically transparent discussion of strong cosmic censorship in semiclassical black holes. We argue that strong cosmic censorship is enforced in asymptotically flat and de Sitter black holes by disentanglement and describe how similar disentanglement might be avoided in some anti-de Sitter cases.</description>

      <title>Foreground biases in strong gravitational lensing</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a competitive tool to probe the dark matter and energy content of the Universe. However, significant uncertainties can arise from the choice of lens model, and in particular the parameterisation of the line of sight. In this work, we consider the consequences of ignoring the contribution of foreground perturbers in lens modelling. We derive the explicit form of the degeneracy between the foreground shear and the ellipticity of a power law lens, which renders the former quantity effectively unmeasurable from strong lensing observables, and biases measurements of the latter by a few percent. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that this degeneracy does not affect measurements of the Einstein radius. Foreground tidal effects are also not expected to bias the slope of the potential, and any biases in this slope should not affect the recovery of the Hubble constant. The foreground convergence term adds an additional uncertainty to the measurement of $H_0$, and we show that this uncertainty will be on the order of $1\%$ for lensing systems located along random lines of sight. There is evidence to indicate that the probability of strong lensing is higher towards overdense lines of sight, and this could result in a small systematic bias towards overestimations of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Probe of Dark Matter in Interferometer Missions: Fisher Forecast and MCMC</title>

Abstract: We propose novel inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectral shapes at interferometer-based current and future GW missions to test dark matter (DM) production via gravity-portal.We consider three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the lightest among them is DM candidate while the others participate in baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that future GW detectors BBO, DECIGO, ET, for instance, are able to probe DM mass for $5\times 10^6\, {\rm GeV}&lt;M_{\rm DM}&lt;1.6\times 10^7$ GeV with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$, along with the observed amount of baryon asymmetry due to gravitational leptogenesis for heavy RHN mass $M_{\cal{N}}$ to be around $8\times 10^{12}$ GeV. Employing Fisher matrix forecast analysis, we identify the parameter space involving non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$ where the GW detector-sensitivities will be the maximum with the least error, along with SNR $&gt;10$. Finally, utilizing mock data for each GW detector, we perform MCMC analysis to find out the combined constraints on the various microphysics parameters. We also explore production of other cosmological relics such as QCD axion relic as DM candidate, produced via gravity-portal in early universe. We find that ET, for instance, can probe the decay constant of such DM candidates ($f_{a}$) as $10^9\,{\rm GeV}\lesssim f_{a}\lesssim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$ for misalignment angle $\theta_i\in[0.1,\pi/\sqrt{3}]$ and $\xi=1$ with SNR $&gt;10$, whereas this range decreases with the increase of non-minimal coupling. Thus the upcoming GW missions will be able to test such non-thermal DM and baryogenesis scenarios involving very high energy scales, which is otherwise impossible to reach in particle physics experiments in laboratories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.</description>

Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity action is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl conformal geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids long-held criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry, that ignored its gauge symmetry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: Weyl gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to Einstein-Hilbert gravity (Riemannian geometry) respectively, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical (Weyl) gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$); all fields and masses have geometric origin (with no added scalar fields); the theory is the perturbative part of a Weyl gauge invariant DBI action of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions. The theory has a Weyl gauge invariant geometric regularisation (by $\hat R$) to $d$ dimensions and it is Weyl-anomaly free; this anomaly is recovered in the broken phase after massive $\omega_\mu$ decouples; in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity and Riemannian geometry; SM has a natural embedding in conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with a successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry provides a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, leading to a unified description by the gauge principle of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM.</description>

      <title>High-redshift cosmography with a possible cosmic distance duality relation violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we used geometric distances at high redshifts (both luminosity and angular) to perform a cosmographic analysis with the Pad\'e method, which stabilizes the behaviour of the cosmographic series in this redshift regime. However, in our analyses, we did not assume the validity of the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR), but allowed for potential violations, such as $d_L(z) = \eta(z)(1+z)^2d_A(z)$, where three different functional forms of $\eta(z)$ are considered. By incorporating updated data from supernovae (SN), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic chronometers (CC), we obtained observational constraints on cosmographic models alongside possible CDDR violations. Interestingly, we found that potential CDDR violations introduce new statistical correlations among cosmographic parameters such as $H_0$, $q_0$, and $j_0$. Nonetheless, within this framework, we did not observe significant deviations from the CDDR, and our results remain consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In the same time, this work provides a novel and straightforward method for testing the CDDR by fixing the background evolution through cosmographic techniques, paving the way for new geometric observational tests of possible deviations from standard cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We give a microscopic derivation of the semi-classical entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities, which are certain 3d Horndeski theories that were recently discovered from higher-dimensional Lovelock gravities via various methods and admit novel black hole solutions analogous to higher-dimensional ones. Assuming the ground state is described by the soliton obtained from the black hole solution by performing a double Wick rotation, we reproduce the semi-classical entropy from Cardy formula without central charges for the asymptotic growth of the number of states. We explain in detail how the mass of the soliton, which is needed in the Cardy formula, can be computed in the mini-superspace formalism.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant subjected to conformal boundary conditions. Our focus is on comparing the series of subextensive terms to predictions from thermal effective field theory, with which we find agreement for the boundary theory on a spatial sphere, hyperbolic space, and flat space. We calculate the leading Wilson coefficients and observe that the first subextensive correction to the free energy is negative. This violates a conjectured bound on this coefficient in quantum field theory, which we interpret as a signal that gravity does not fully decouple in the putative boundary dual.</description>

Abstract: An axion-like spectator during inflation can trigger a tachyonic instability which amplifies the modes of one of the helicities of the gauge field, resulting in the production of parity-violating gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we investigate the impact of the coupling $RFF$ of the gauge field to gravity on the production of GWs. We find that such a coupling introduces a multiplicative factor to the tachyonic mass, which effectively enhances the amplitude of the gauge field modes. Produced GWs are expected to be observed by future space-based GW detectors. Additionally, we find that the strong backreaction due to particle production leads to multiple peaks in the energy spectrum of GWs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour, which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., one whose speed of sound in the rest frame differs from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.</description>

      <title>Primary scalar hair in Gauss-Bonnet black holes with Thurston horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct novel asymptotically locally AdS$_5$ black hole solutions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point, supported by a scalar field that generates primary hair. The strength of the scalar field is governed by an independent integration constant; when this constant vanishes, the spacetime reduces to a black hole geometry devoid of hair. The existence of these solutions is intrinsically tied to the horizon metric, which is modeled by three non-trivial Thurston geometries: Nil, Solv, and $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The quadratic part of the scalar field action corresponds to a conformally coupled scalar in five dimensions -an invariance of the matter sector that is explicitly broken by the introduction of a quartic self-interaction. These black holes are characterized by two distinct parameters: the horizon radius and the temperature. Notably, there exists a straight line in this parameter space along which the horizon geometry exhibits enhanced isometries, corresponding to solutions previously reported in JHEP 02, 014 (2014). Away from this line, for a fixed horizon radius and temperatures above or below a critical value, the metric's isometries undergo spontaneous breaking. Employing the Regge-Teitelboim approach, we compute the mass and entropy of these solutions, both of which vanish. Despite this, only one of the integration constants can be interpreted as hair, as the other modifies the local geometry at the conformal boundary. Finally, for Solv horizon geometries, we extend these hairy solutions to six dimensions.</description>
