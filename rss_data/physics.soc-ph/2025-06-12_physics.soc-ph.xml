      <title>Universal roughness and the dynamics of urban expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to quantity urban sprawl using tools from surface growth physics. Analyzing built-up area expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015), we uncover anisotropic growth with branch-like extensions and a piecewise linear relation between area and population. A universal local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}} \approx 0.54$ coexists with variable exponents $\beta$, $z$. As modeling urban sprawl remains an open problem, these results offer a necessary empirical basis for theory.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</description>

      <title>Comparing name generator designs in rural panel studies: analyzing alter retention and change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a two-wave personal network study in a rural Romanian community, interviewing the same participants (n = 68) using two name generators. Wave 1 employed a fixed-choice generator (n = 25) focused on emotional closeness; Wave 2 used a free-choice generator based on frequent interaction. We compared tie characteristics and assessed retention across waves. Alters who were kin, co-residents, or emotionally close were more likely to be retained, regardless of generator type. These findings underscore the role of relational attributes in personal network stability and highlight design considerations for network studies in resource-limited, culturally distinct settings.</description>

      <title>Educational Intervention Re-Wires Social Interactions in Isolated Village Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social networks shape behavior, disseminate information, and undergird collective action within communities. Consequently, they can be very valuable in the design of effective interventions to improve community well-being. But any exogenous intervention in networked groups, including ones that just involve the provision of information, can also possibly modify the underlying network structure itself, and some interventions are indeed designed to do so. While social networks obey certain fundamental principles (captured by network-level statistics, such as the degree distribution or transitivity level), they can nevertheless undergo change across time, as people form and break ties with each other within an overall population. Here, using a randomized controlled trial in 110 remote Honduran villages involving 8,331 people, we evaluated the effects of a 22-month public health intervention on pre-existing social network structures. We leverage a two-stage randomized design, where a varying fraction of households received the intervention in each village. In low-dosage villages (5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) compared to untreated villages (0%), over a two-year period, individuals who received the intervention tended to sever both inbound and outbound ties with untreated individuals whom they previously trusted for health advice. Conversely, in high-dosage villages (50%, 75%, and 100%), treated individuals increased both their inbound and outbound ties. Furthermore, although the intervention was health-focused, it also reshaped broader friendship and financial ties. In aggregate, the imposition of a novel health information regime in rural villages (as a kind of social institution) led to a significant rewiring in individuals particular connections, but it still had a limited effect on the overall global structure of the village-wide social networks.</description>

      <title>Like a coin spinning in the air: the effect of (non-)metaphorical explanations on comprehension and attitudes towards quantum technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of the science underlying quantum technology may pose a barrier to its democratization. This study investigated whether metaphors improve comprehension of, and shape attitudes toward, quantum technology. In an online experiment (n = 1,167 participants representative of the Dutch population), participants read a news article that included a metaphorical, non-metaphorical, or no explanation of a quantum phenomenon. Both explanation types reduced perceived comprehension of the news article compared to the control group, but increased actual comprehension of the quantum phenomenon. No direct effects were found on affect-based or cognition-based attitudes. Mediation analyses revealed a very small negative indirect effect of explanations on attitudes, through lower perceived comprehension, and a very small positive indirect effect of explanations on attitudes via increased actual comprehension - though the latter was counteracted by a negative direct effect. As metaphors offered no additional benefit over non-metaphorical explanations, the findings suggest they do not provide a communicative advantage for enhancing understanding or shaping attitudes in this context.</description>

      <title>Emergent Complexity in the Decision-Making Process of Chess Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the decision-making process of chess players by using a chess engine to evaluate the moves across different pools of games. We quantified the decisiveness of each move during the games using a metric derived from the engine's evaluation of the positions. We then performed a comparative analysis across players of varying competitive levels. Firstly, we observed that players face a wide spectrum of the decisiveness metric, evidencing the complexity of the process. By examining groups of winning and losing players, we found evidence where a decrease in complexity may be associated with a drop in players' performance levels. Secondly, we observed that players' accuracy increases in positions with high values of the decisiveness metric regardless of competitive level. Complementing this information with a null model where players make completely random legal moves allowed us to characterize the decision-making process under the simple strategy of making moves that minimize the decisiveness metric. Finally, based on this idea, we proposed a simple model that approximately replicates the global emergent properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Identification and Optimization of High-Performance Passing Networks in Football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between the performance of a football team and the topological parameters of temporal passing networks. To achieve this, we propose a method to identify moments of high and low team performance based on the analysis of match events. This approach enables the construction of sets of temporal passing networks associated with each performance context. By analyzing topological metrics such as clustering, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness across both sets, significant structural differences were identified between moments of high and low performance. These differences reflect changes in the interaction dynamics among players and, consequently, in the team's playing system. Subsequently, a logistic regression model was employed to classify high- and low-performance networks. The analysis of the model coefficients identified which metrics need to be adjusted to promote the emergence of structures associated with better performance. This framework provides quantitative tools to guide tactical decisions and optimize playing dynamics. Finally, the proposed method was applied to address the ``blocked player" problem, optimizing passing relationships to minimize the emergence of structures associated with low performance, thereby ensuring more robust dynamics against contextual changes.</description>

      <title>Meta-heuristic Hypergraph-Assisted Robustness Optimization for Higher-order Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex systems (e.g., communication, transportation, and biological networks), high robustness ensures sustained functionality and stability even when resisting attacks. However, the inherent structure complexity and the unpredictability of attacks make robustness optimization challenging. Hypergraphs provide a framework for modeling complicated higher-order interactions in complex systems naturally, but their potential has not been systematically investigated. Therefore, we propose an effective method based on genetic algorithms from Artificial Intelligence to optimize the robustness of complex systems modeled by hypergraphs. By integrating percolation-based metrics with adaptive computational techniques, our method achieves improved accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating malicious attacks, with robustness improvements ranging from 16.6% to 205.2%. Further in-depth analysis reveals that optimized hypergraph-based systems exhibit a preferential connection mechanism in which high-hyperdegree nodes preferentially connect to lower-cardinality hyperedges, forming a distinctive Lotus topology that significantly improves robustness. Based on this finding, we propose a robust hypergraph generation method that allows robustness to be controlled via a single parameter rb. Notably, for rb&lt;-1, a distinct Cactus topology emerges as an alternative to the Lotus topology observed for rb&gt;1. The discovery of the Lotus and Cactus topologies offers valuable insights for designing robust higher-order networks while providing a useful foundation for investigating cascading failure dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>How much regulation do we need from genomes to society?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulatory functions are essential in both socioeconomic and biological systems, from corporate managers to regulatory genes. Regulatory functions come with substantial costs and benefits, and the balance of the two is often taken for granted. A fundamental question for all complex systems becomes how much regulatory function do they need for their size and function? Here, we present empirical evidence that regulatory functions scale systematically across diverse systems: biological organisms (bacterial and eukaryotic genomes), human organizations (companies, federal agencies, universities), and decentralized entities (Wikipedia, cities). We combine an analysis of large data sets from each of these domains with a simple conceptual model. The model predicts that the scaling of regulatory costs shifts with system structure. Well-mixed small systems exhibit superlinear scaling between size and regulatory function, while modular large ones show sublinear or linear scaling, both in agreement with data. Finally, we find that socioeconomic systems that contain more diverse occupational functions tend to have more regulatory costs than expected from the scaling relationships, confirming the hypothesis that the type and complexity of interactions also play a role in regulatory costs. Our cross-system comparison offers a mechanistic framework for understanding regulatory function and can potentially guide efforts to analyze the costs and benefits of regulatory function in diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Fast nonparametric inference of network backbones for weighted graph sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network backbones provide useful sparse representations of weighted networks by keeping only their most important links, permitting a range of computational speedups and simplifying network visualizations. A key limitation of existing network backboning methods is that they either require the specification of a free parameter (e.g. significance level) that determines the number of edges to keep in the backbone, or impose specific restrictions on the topology of the backbone (e.g. that it is a spanning tree). Here we develop a completely nonparametric framework for inferring the backbone of a weighted network that overcomes these limitations and automatically selects the optimal set of edges to retain using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We develop objective functions for global and local network backboning which evaluate the importance of an edge in the context of the whole network and individual node neighborhoods respectively and are generalizable to any weight distribution under Bayesian model specifications that fix the average edge weight either exactly or in expectation. We then construct an efficient and provably optimal greedy algorithm to identify the backbone minimizing our objectives, whose runtime complexity is log-linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate our methods by comparing them with existing methods in a range of tasks on real and synthetic networks, finding that both the global and local backboning methods can preserve network connectivity, weight heterogeneity, and spreading dynamics while removing a substantial fraction of edges.</description>

      <title>Temporal and Topological Partitioning of a Large-Scale Real-World Network: Scale-Free Properties and Minimal Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale, real-world growing network connecting software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network comprises approximately 6 billion nodes and edges and spans more than 40 years of growth. Our analysis leverages natural partitions of nodes and edges, based on both temporal and topological attributes.
  A derived temporalized graph reveals a global bow-tie-like structure and enables a preliminary investigation of edge dynamics (such as creation, inheritance, and aging) alongside comparisons with minimal models. We analyze degree distributions over time, edge timestamp histograms, and estimates of the in-degree distribution's scaling exponent. The results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and to the presence of numerous outliers, while showing that the proposed partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
  Node types derived from topological and temporal partitions reveal regime shifts associated with changes in developer practices, notably variations in the average number of new edges per new node over time. These structural and dynamical transitions hinder definitive conclusions regarding the existence and observability of a scale-free regime, and underscore the need for advanced tools to study transient growth phases and to facilitate robust comparisons between real-world evolving networks and minimal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a retrospective of the BETHE (Breakthroughs Enabling THermonuclear-fusion Energy) and GAMOW (Galvanizing Advances in Market-aligned fusion for an Overabundance of Watts) fusion programs of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), as well as fusion project cohorts (associated with OPEN 2018, OPEN 2021, and Exploratory Topics) initiated during the same time period (2018-2022). BETHE (announced in 2019) aimed to increase the number of higher-maturity, lower-cost fusion approaches. GAMOW (announced in 2020) aimed to expand and translate research-and-development efforts in materials, fuel-cycle, and enabling technologies needed for commercial fusion energy. Both programs had a vision of enabling timely commercial fusion energy while laying the foundation for greater public-private collaborations to accelerate fusion-energy development. Finally, this paper describes ARPA-E's fusion Technology-to-Market (T2M) activities during this era, which included supporting ARPA-E fusion performers' commercialization pathways, improving fusion costing models, exploring cost targets for potential early markets for fusion energy, engaging with the broader fusion ecosystem (especially investors and nongovernmental organizations), and highlighting the importance of social license for timely fusion commercialization.</description>
