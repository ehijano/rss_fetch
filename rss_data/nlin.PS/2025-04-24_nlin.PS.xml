      <title>A PDE Model for Janus Particle Swarming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been experimentally shown that Brownian motion and active forward drift controlled by quorum sensing is sufficient to produce clustering behavior in orientable Janus particles. This paper explores the group formation and cohesion of Janus particles using both an agent-based computer model and a nonlocal advection-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) model. Our PDE model can recreate the behavior from both physical experimentation and computer simulations. Additionally, the PDE model highlights an annular structure which was not apparent in prior work.</description>

      <title>Spot solutions to a neural field equation on oblate spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.</description>

      <title>Interactions of mechanical rarefaction solitary waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between solitary waves have been pivotal to understanding nonlinear phenomena across various disciplines. The dynamics of rarefaction solitary waves holds great potential, yet their fundamental characteristics and interactions remain only partially understood through experimental means in mechanical metamaterials. Previous studies highlighted their existence and proposed applications, such as waveguides, impact mitigation, and energy harvesting. Challenges, including energy dissipation and a lack of precise measurement techniques, have hindered deeper exploration, most notably of solitonic collisions. In this work, we provide a definitive platform for examining pure rarefaction solitons propagating through a strain-softening mechanical lattice, addressing these challenges. Employing a theoretical framework based on the Boussinesq approximation and multiple-scale analysis, we predict soliton behavior, including phase shifts resulting from head-on collisions. These theoretical insights are corroborated through numerical simulations and systematic experiments designed to generate and measure pure rarefaction solitons with high precision. Both symmetric and asymmetric collisions are examined, revealing practically elastic interaction behaviors and amplitude-dependent phase shifts. Furthermore, collision dynamics, such as speed and phase shifts during rarefaction soliton collisions, from the experimental results show agreement with theoretical and numerical models. These results validate our experimental platform and findings, underscoring the potential of mechanical rarefaction solitons as robust, controllable wave packets. This suggests a robust paradigm for exploring nonlinear wave interactions in mechanical systems, opening new application avenues in mechanical metamaterials, such as wave-based computing and advanced signal processing.</description>

      <title>NLS approximation and dark solitons for the Adlam-Allen model of cold collisionless plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work extends earlier considerations on a quintessential model of cold, collisionless plasmas, namely the Adlam-Allen model. Previously, an analysis of homoclinic solutions around a non-vanishing background (associated with a saddle equilibrium) led to a Korteweg-de Vries reduction. Here, we consider a different equilibrium of the co-traveling frame model, namely a center, and expanding around it, by means of a multiple-scale methodology and suitable scalings, leads to an effective defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Leveraging the latter, we construct, for the first time to our knowledge, physically realistic dark soliton waveforms of the Adlam-Allen model. We subsequently test the numerical evolution of such coherent structures, identifying them as long-lived waveforms of the full model.</description>

      <title>Self-induced topological edge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological edge states typically arise at the boundaries of topologically nontrivial structures or at interfaces between regions with differing topological invariants. When topological systems are extended into the nonlinear regime, linear topological edge states bifurcate into nonlinear counterparts, and topological gap solitons emerge in the bulk of the structures. Despite extensive studies of these two types of nonlinear states, self-induced topological edge states localized at the physical boundaries of originally nontopological structures remain underexplored. Unlike the previously reported self-induced topological transitions driven by nonlinear couplings, which are conceptually straightforward but less common in realistic interacting systems, here we experimentally realize self-induced topological edge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity. Leveraging the strong and tunable nonlinearity of electrical circuits, we systematically investigate the localized states in a nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Besides revisiting the nonlinear topological edge states and topological gap solitons, we uncover a novel type of self-induced topological edge states which exhibit the hallmark features of linear topological edge states, including sublattice polarization, phase jumps, and decaying tails that approach zero. A distinctive feature of these states is the boundary-induced power threshold for existence. Our results are broadly applicable and can be readily extended to photonic and cold atomic systems, where onsite nonlinearities naturally arise from interparticle interactions. Our work unveils new opportunities for exploring novel correlated topological states of light and matter, and paves the way for the development of robust photonic devices and topological quantum computation.</description>
