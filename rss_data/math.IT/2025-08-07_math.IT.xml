      <title>Single Fragment Forensic Coding from Discrepancy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printing's accessibility enables rapid manufacturing but also poses security risks, such as the unauthorized production of untraceable firearms and prohibited items. To ensure traceability and accountability, embedding unique identifiers within printed objects is essential, in order to assist forensic investigation of illicit use. This paper models data embedding in 3D printing using principles from error-correcting codes, aiming to recover embedded information from partial or altered fragments of the object. Previous works embedded one-dimensional data (i.e., a vector) inside the object, and required almost all fragments of the object for successful decoding. In this work, we study a problem setting in which only one sufficiently large fragment of the object is available for decoding. We first show that for one-dimensional embedded information the problem can be easily solved using existing tools. Then, we introduce novel encoding schemes for two-dimensional information (i.e., a matrix), and three-dimensional information (i.e., a cube) which enable the information to be decoded from any sufficiently large rectangle-shaped or cuboid-shaped fragment. Lastly, we introduce a code that is also capable of correcting bit-flip errors, using techniques from recently proposed codes for DNA storage. Our codes operate at non-vanishing rates, and involve concepts from discrepancy theory called Van der Corput sets and Halton-Hammersely sets in novel ways.</description>

      <title>One-weight codes in the sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-weight codes, in which all nonzero codewords share the same weight, form a highly structured class of linear codes with deep connections to finite geometry. While their classification is well understood in the Hamming and rank metrics - being equivalent to (direct sums of) simplex codes - the sum-rank metric presents a far more intricate landscape. In this work, we explore the geometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct classes. First, we introduce and classify \emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank codes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending results from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general \emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification remains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results for this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD (Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from partitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three, we connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the projective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain fields.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Reduction Necessary for Vector Perturbation Precoding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector perturbation (VP) precoding is an effective nonlinear precoding technique in the downlink (DL) with modulo channels. Especially, when combined with Lattice reduction (LR), low-complexity algorithms achieve very promising performances, outperforming other popular nonlinear precoding techniques like Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). However, these results are based on the uncoded symbol error rate (SER) or uncoded bit error rate (BER). We show that when using the mutual information as the figure of merit, the observation is fundamentally different and that these algorithms generally do not outperform THP. Within the expression of the mutual information, a rate allocation matrix can be incorporated, which has not received much attention so far. In this article, we derive the optimal choice of this matrix for different algorithms, and we show that this matrix is indeed crucial for the performance, especially for ill-conditioned channels. Furthermore, when using an optimized choice of this matrix, we show that the classical LR-aided algorithms cannot exceed the rate of THP, highlighting the effectiveness of the THP method. This concept can be generalized to a whole class of algorithms for which LR yields no improvement. We derive the corresponding properties and categorize various algorithms accordingly.</description>

      <title>Bases of Riemann-Roch spaces associated with arbitrary elliptic curve divisors and their application in constructing various elliptic Codes families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine explicit bases for Riemann--Roch spaces associated with various families of elliptic codes. We establish the feasibility and provide exact algorithms for constructing bases of Riemann--Roch spaces corresponding to arbitrary divisors on elliptic curves. These results are subsequently applied to derive bases for quasi-cyclic elliptic codes and their subfield subcodes as well as for the class of Goppa-like elliptic codes. For algebraic geometry code applications, having an explicit description of Riemann--Roch space bases for arbitrary divisors is particularly valuable as it simultaneously enables efficient code construction and reveals structural properties of the codes leading to the new cryptanalysis methods when these codes are employed in cryptographic schemes</description>

      <title>Grid-like Error-Correcting Codes for Matrix Multiplication with Better Correcting Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix multiplication over the real field constitutes a foundational operation in the training of deep learning models, serving as a computational cornerstone for both forward and backward propagation processes. However, the presence of silent data corruption (SDC) in large-scale distributed training environments poses a significant threat to model convergence and predictive accuracy, particularly when such errors manifest during matrix multiplication. Due to their transient and non-intrusive nature, these errors often evade detection, allowing them to propagate and accumulate over time, ultimately leading to substantial degradation in model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel error-correcting coding framework specifically tailored for matrix multiplication operations. Our proposed framework is designed to detect and correct multiple computational errors that may arise during the execution of matrix products. By leveraging a grid-based structural encoding scheme, our approach enhances error localization and correction capabilities across all participating matrices, thereby significantly improving the fault tolerance of the computation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves deterministic correction of up to two erroneous symbols distributed across three matrices with 100\% reliability, while incurring only a 24\% overhead in computational time on GPU architectures. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the error-correction properties inherent to our coding scheme, establishing its correctness and robustness under well-defined fault models.</description>

      <title>Tradeoff Between the Number of Transmitted Molecules and the BER Performance in Molecular Communication between Bionanosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of molecular communication (MC), information is conveyed through the characteristics of molecules transmitted between the transmitter and the receiver bionanosensors via propagation. The constrained size of the transmitter imposes limitations on its storage capacity, constraining the number of available molecules for transmission, with a resulting effect on communication reliability. This paper primarily focuses on achieving an equilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate (BER) performance. To this end, we first analyze the relationship between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance. Subsequently, a balancing function that considers both the number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance is introduced, taking into account the molecules' respective weights. Given the difference in magnitude between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to facilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to determine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the optimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system. Theoretical and simulation results are provided, substantiating that the optimal outcome indeed establishes an ideal balance between the number of transmitted molecules and the BER.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Hybrid Beamfocusing for Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a pivotal component of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, leveraging high-frequency bands and massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) to deliver both high-capacity communication and high-precision sensing. However, these technological advancements lead to significant near-field effects, while the implementation of M-MIMO \mbox{is associated with considerable} hardware costs and escalated power consumption. In this context, hybrid architecture designs emerge as both hardware-efficient and energy-efficient solutions. Motivated by these considerations, we investigate the design of energy-efficient hybrid beamfocusing for near-field ISAC under two distinct target scenarios, i.e., a point target and an extended target. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) of joint angle-and-distance estimation for the point target and the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) of the target response matrix for the extended target. Building on these derived results, we minimize the CRB/BCRB by optimizing the transmit beamfocusing, while ensuring the energy efficiency (EE) of the system and the quality-of-service (QoS) for communication users. To address the resulting \mbox{nonconvex problems}, we first utilize a penalty-based successive convex approximation technique with a fully-digital beamformer to obtain a suboptimal solution. Then, we propose an efficient alternating \mbox{optimization} algorithm to design the analog-and-digital beamformer. \mbox{Simulation} results indicate that joint distance-and-angle estimation is feasible in the near-field region. However, the adopted hybrid architectures inevitably degrade the accuracy of distance estimation, compared with their fully-digital counterparts. Furthermore, enhancements in system EE would compromise the accuracy of target estimation, unveiling a nontrivial tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to achieve significantly better performance compared to the standardized Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), in high delay/Doppler spread scenarios envisaged in next generation communication systems. Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay axis (``delay period") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and (ii) the pulse shaping filter. An important practical challenge is enabling support for Zak-OTFS modulation in existing CP-OFDM based modems. In this paper we show that Zak-OTFS modulation with pulse shaping constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth equal to the communication bandwidth $B$) followed by time-windowing with a rectangular window of duration $(T + T_{cp})$ ($T$ is the symbol duration and $T_{cp}$ is the CP duration), can be implemented as a low-complexity precoder over standard CP-OFDM. We also show that the Zak-OTFS de-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be implemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator output. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM" architecture enables us to harness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also show that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with CP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible value equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum delay period.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description>

      <title>Millions of inequivalent quadratic APN functions in eight variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The only known example of an almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutation in even dimension was obtained by applying CCZ-equivalence to a specific quadratic APN function. Motivated by this result, there have been numerous recent attempts to construct new quadratic APN functions. Currently, 32,892 quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 are known and two recent conjectures address their possible total number. The first, proposed by Y. Yu and L. Perrin (Cryptogr. Commun. 14(6): 1359-1369, 2022), suggests that there are more than 50,000 such functions. The second, by A. Polujan and A. Pott (Proc. 7th Int. Workshop on Boolean Functions and Their Applications, 2022), argues that their number exceeds that of inequivalent quadratic (8,4)-bent functions, which is 92,515. We computationally construct 3,775,599 inequivalent quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 and estimate the total number to be about 6 million.</description>

      <title>Weight Distribution of Repeated-Root Cyclic Codes with Prime Power Lengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the weight distribution of a linear code is a classical and fundamental topic in coding theory that has been extensively investigated. Repeated-root cyclic codes, which form a significant subclass of error-correcting codes, have found broad applications in quantum error-correcting codes, symbol-pair codes, and storage codes. Through polynomial derivation, we derive the monomial equivalent codes for these repeated-root cyclic codes with prime power lengths. Given that monomial equivalent codes exhibit identical weight distributions, we transform the computation of the weight distribution of these repeated-root cyclic codes into the computation of the weight distribution of their monomial equivalent codes. Leveraging the classical results on the weight distribution of MDS codes, we explicitly determine the weight distribution of these repeated-root cyclic codes. Moreover, we apply the weight distribution formula to construct a class of $p$-weight cyclic codes for any prime $p$.</description>

      <title>The Markov-Chain Polytope with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11622v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding a minimum-cost $m$-state Markov chain $(S_0,\ldots,S_{m-1})$ in a large set of chains. The chains studied have a reward associated with each state. The cost of a chain is its "gain", i.e., its average reward under its stationary distribution.
  Specifically, for each $k=0,\ldots,m-1$ there is a known set ${\mathbb S}_k$ of type-$k$ states. A permissible Markov chain contains exactly one state of each type; the problem is to find a minimum-cost permissible chain.
  The original motivation was to find a cheapest binary AIFV-$m$ lossless code on a source alphabet of size $n$. Such a code is an $m$-tuple of trees, in which each tree can be viewed as a Markov Chain state. This formulation was then used to address other problems in lossless compression. The known solution techniques for finding minimum-cost Markov chains were iterative and ran in exponential time.
  This paper shows how to map every possible type-$k$ state into a type-$k$ hyperplane and then define a "Markov Chain Polytope" as the lower envelope of all such hyperplanes. Finding a minimum-cost Markov chain can then be shown to be equivalent to finding a "highest" point on this polytope.
  The local optimization procedures used in the previous iterative algorithms are shown to be separation oracles for this polytope. Since these were often polynomial time, an application of the Ellipsoid method immediately leads to polynomial time algorithms for these problems.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) into cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users-energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs)-without sacrificing time-frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BD-RIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero-forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non-coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy (HE) at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BD-RIS, all based on long-term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub-problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BD-RIS with a group-or fully-connected architecture achieves significant EH gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a 7-fold increase in the average sum of HE when a heuristic-based scattering matrix design is employed. Index Terms-Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), deep reinforcement learning (DRL).</description>

      <title>Coded Kalman Filtering over MIMO Gaussian Channels with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of remotely stabilizing a dynamical system. A sensor (encoder) co-located with the system communicates with a controller (decoder), whose goal is to stabilize the system, over a noisy communication channel with feedback. To accomplish this, the controller must estimate the system state with finite mean squared error (MSE). The vector-valued dynamical system state follows a Gauss-Markov law with additive control. The channel is a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. For such a source, a linear encoder, and a MIMO AWGN channel, the minimal MSE decoder is a Kalman filter. The parameters of the Kalman filter and the linear encoder can be jointly optimized, under a power constraint at the channel input. We term the resulting encoder-decoder pair a coded Kalman filter. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the coded Kalman filter to achieve a finite MSE in the real-time estimation of the state. For sufficiency, we introduce a coding scheme where each unstable mode of the state is estimated using the channel outputs of a single sub-channel. We prove a coinciding necessity condition when either the source or channel is scalar and present a matrix-algebraic condition which implies the condition is necessary in general. Finally, we provide a new counter-example demonstrating that linear codes are generally sub-optimal for coding over MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Perfect Hermitian rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates Hermitian rank-metric codes, a special class of rank-metric codes, focusing on perfect codes and on the analysis of their covering properties. Firstly, we establish bounds on the size of spheres in the space of Hermitian matrices and, as a consequence, we show that non-trivial perfect codes do not exist in the Hermitian case. We conclude the paper by examining their covering density.</description>

      <title>Pull-Based Query Scheduling for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.</description>

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Spatiotemporal 2-D Polar Codes for Massive MIMO with MMSE Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the evolution from 5G to 6G, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) faces increasingly stringent performance requirements. Lower latency constraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade decoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its abundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically capacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical applicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal two-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly applied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large spatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the spatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within this framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization behavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving property of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints and large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to traditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly reduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve reliability under the same latency constraint -- offering a capacity-achieving and latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in future 6G URLLC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>
