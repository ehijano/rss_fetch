      <title>Auslander-Yorke Dichotomy and Its Generalizations for Non-Autonomous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of periodic non-autonomous discrete dynamical systems on uniform spaces and topological spaces, focusing on the extension of the classical Auslander-Yorke dichotomy to these settings. We prove various dichotomy theorems in the uniform space framework, showing that a minimal periodic non-autonomous system is either sensitive or equicontinuous, and prove some more refined versions involving syndetic equicontinuity and thick sensitivity and eventual sensitivity versus equicontinuity on compact uniform spaces. We further introduce topological analogues like topological equicontinuity, Hausdorff sensitivity, and their syndetic and multi-sensitive variants and prove corresponding Auslander-Yorke-type dichotomies on T3 spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff Dimension of Measures for a Non-Uniquely Ergodic Family of Interval Exchange Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on a construction by J. Fickenscher, we construct a family of non-uniquely ergodic interval exchange transformations on $n$ intervals with the maximal possible number of measures, $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$. Subsequently, we generalize J. Chaika's result on estimating the Hausdorff dimension of the two measures from M. Keane's example to the family of interval exchange transformations with the maximal possible number of measures.</description>

      <title>An exceptional set of uniformly spread Kakutani tilings of the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\alpha}-Kakutani substitution rule splits the unit interval into two subintervals of lengths alpha and 1 - {\alpha}, for a fixed {\alpha} in (0,1). A simple inflation-substitution procedure produces tilings of the real line and their associated Delone sets. We show that there are precisely five distinct values of min({\alpha}, 1 - {\alpha}) for which these sets are uniformly spread, meaning that they are a bounded displacement of a lattice. The proof of this surprising fact combines the construction and analysis of a related family of primitive substitution tilings, Solomon's criterion for uniform spreadness, and a classification of Pisot-Vijayaraghavan polynomials.</description>

      <title>From geometry to dynamics: Learning overdamped Langevin dynamics from sparse observations with geometric constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we learn the laws underlying the dynamics of stochastic systems when their trajectories are sampled sparsely in time? Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover. Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification methods.</description>

      <title>Set Valued Riemann-Liouville integral and some Regular Selections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral of set-valued mappings via integrable selections. We establish fundamental properties of this fractional integral, including convexity, boundedness, and continuity with respect to the Hausdorff metric. The investigation of preservation of regularity under fractional integration with respect to the Hausdorff metric is given. We show that bounded variation and Lipschitz continuity of a set-valued mapping are inherited by its Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. We discuss the existence of regular selections for the fractional integral under the corresponding regularity assumptions on the original mapping. In the scalar case, we further identify extremal selections given by the pointwise minimum and maximum of the fractional integral and show that they possess the same regularity properties. Finally, we discuss possible applications in differential inclusion and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Time Reparametrization, Not Fractional Calculus: A Reassessment of the Conformable Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conformable derivative has been promoted in numerous publications as a new fractional derivative operator. This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of Diophantine pairs among the equivalence classes of quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fixed integer n, a pair of nonzero integers {a, c} is called a D(n)-pair if the product ac plus n is a perfect square.
  In this short note we prove that D(n)-pairs are asymptotically equidistributed (via their associated quadratic forms) among proper SL_2(Z)-equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms of discriminant 4n with fixed content. As a consequence, we obtain a more streamlined and simpler proof of Badesa's asymptotic formula for the number of D(n)-pairs.</description>

      <title>On the efficient numerical computation of covariant Lyapunov vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) are useful in multiple applications, but the optimal time windows needed to accurately compute these vectors are yet unclear. To remedy this, we investigate two methods for determining when to safely terminate the forward and backward transient phases of the CLV computation algorithm by Ginelli et al.~\cite{GinelliEtAl2007} when applied to chaotic orbits of conservative Hamiltonian systems. We perform this investigation for two prototypical Hamiltonian systems, namely the well-known H\'enon-Heiles system of two degrees of freedom and a system of three nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators having three degrees of freedom, finding very similar results for the two methods and thus recommending the more efficient one. We find that the accuracy of two-dimesnional center subspace computations is significantly reduced when the backward evolution stages of the algorithm are performed over long time intervals. We explain this observation by examining the tangent dynamics of the center subspace wherein CLVs tend to align/anti-align, and we propose an adaptation of the algorithm that improves the accuracy of such computations over long times by preventing this alignment/anti-alignment of CLVs in the center subspace.</description>

      <title>Guillarmou's Normal Operator for Magnetic and Thermostat Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guillarmou's normal operator over a closed Anosov manifold is analogous to the classical normal operator of the geodesic X-ray transform over manifolds with boundary. In this paper, we generalize this normal operator, under some dynamical assumptions, to thermostat flows as well as to the case of the magnetic flows. In particular, we show that these generalized normal operators are elliptic pseudodifferential operators of order -1 in each case. As an application, we prove a stability estimate for the magnetic X-ray transform.</description>

      <title>Chamber zeta function and closed galleries in the standard non-uniform complex from $\operatorname{PGL}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $\Gamma\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $\Gamma=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The irrationality exponent of a real number measures how well that number can be approximated by rationals. Real numbers with irrationality exponent strictly greater than $2$ are transcendental numbers, and form a set with rich fractal structure. We show that this set intersects the limit set of any parabolic iterated function system arising from the backward continued fraction in a set of full Hausdorff dimension. As a corollary, we show that the set of irrationals whose irrationality exponents are strictly bigger than $2$ and whose backward continued fraction expansions have bounded partial quotients is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. This is a sharp contrast to the fact that there exists no irrational whose irrationality exponent is strictly greater than $2$ and whose regular continued fraction expansion has bounded partial quotients.</description>

Abstract: We prove the a.e. nonamenability of locally finite quasi-pmp Borel graphs whose every component admits at least three nonvanishing ends with respect to the underlying Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We witness their nonamenability by constructing Borel subforests with at least three nonvanishing ends per component, and then applying Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob's recent characterization of amenability for acyclic quasi-pmp Borel graphs. Our main technique is a weighted cycle-cutting algorithm, which yields a weight-maximal spanning forest. We also introduce a random version of this forest, which generalizes the Free Minimal Spanning Forest, to capture nonunimodularity in the context of percolation theory.</description>

      <title>To Define the Core Entropy for All Polynomials Having a Connected Julia Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For all polynomials $f$ with ${\rm deg}(f)\ge2$ that have a connected filled Julia set $K$, we introduce a new quantity $h_{\rm GCE}(f)$, such that $h_{\rm GCE}\left(f^n\right)=n\cdot h_{\rm GCE}(f)$ for all $n\ge1$ and $h_{\rm GCE}(f)=h_{\rm GCE}(g)$ for $J$-equivalent $f$ and $g$. When the coefficients and the critical points of $f$ are real, $h_{\rm GCE}(f)=h(K\cap\mathbb{R},f)$. When $f$ is post-critically finite, $h_{\rm GCE}(f)$ equals the core entropy $h(\mathcal{H}(f),f)$, where $\mathcal{H}(f)$ is the Hubbard tree. For $f_c(z)=z^2+c$ with $c$ varying in the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$, the entropy map $c\mapsto h_{\rm GCE}(f_c)$ is not continuous. However, its lower envelope $h_{\rm core}:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ given by $h_{\rm core}(c)=\inf\left\{t:\ \exists\ c_n\ne c\ \text{with}\ c_n\rightarrow c\ \text{and}\ t=\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}h_{\rm GCE}\left(f_{c_n}\right)\right\}$ is continuous over $\mathcal{M}$ and has three properties. First, every $h_{\rm core}^{-1}([0,s])$ with $s\ge0$ is connected. In particular, $h_{\rm core}^{-1}(0)$ coincides with the central molecule. Second, $h_{\rm core}(c)=h(\mathbb{R},f_c)$ for $c\in[-2,\frac14]$. Third, $h_{\rm core}(c)=h(\mathcal{H}(f_c),f_c)$ for post-critically finite $f_c$.</description>

      <title>Contraction 2.0 Natural Metrics in Contraction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contraction analysis establishes exponential incremental convergence of a nonlinear system by solving a linear matrix inequality for a contraction metric, and has become a standard resource for solving problems in nonlinear control and estimation. This paper shows that, for a general nonlinear time-varying system, a contraction metric can be systematically derived by rewriting the system dynamics as a complex natural gradient dynamics. In this form, the variational dynamics can be modally decomposed with geodesic coordinates, and exact exponential convergence rates can be computed. The results are extended to systems with nonlinear inequality constraints. All derivations are tensor-based, and the computed eigenvalues themselves are coordinate-invariant, i.e., the contraction rates are independent of the chosen coordinate system.
  Simple examples including a gravity pendulum, gradient descent with non-convex cost, Schuler dynamics, and a two-link manipulator, illustrate that the computation of the decomposed convergence rates is straightforward. The role of inequality constraints is illustrated for a controller confined to an operational envelope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $C^{1+}$ maps, possibly non-invertible and with singularities, we prove that each homoclinic class of an ergodic adapted hyperbolic measure carries at most one adapted hyperbolic measure of maximal entropy. We then apply this to study the finiteness/uniqueness of such measures in several different settings: finite horizon dispersing billiards, codimension one partially hyperbolic endomorphisms with ``large'' entropy, robustly non-uniformly hyperbolic volume-preserving endomorphisms as in Andersson-Carrasco-Saghin (2025), and Viana maps (1997).</description>

      <title>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</description>

Abstract: We prove a generalised Yuan--Hunt--Ma\~n\'e Conjecture: if $\mathcal{F}$ is the Banach space of $\alpha$-H\"older functions, and $\mathcal{T}$ is either a space of Lipschitz expanding maps, or of Anosov diffeomorphisms, or the family of beta-transformations on the interval, there is an open dense subset of $\mathcal{T}\times\mathcal{F}$ consisting of map-function pairs whose maximizing invariant measure is unique and supported on a periodic orbit.</description>

      <title>Divergence-kernel method for linear responses of densities and generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response of random dynamical systems. Specifically, the pathwise expression is for the parameter-derivative of the marginal or stationary density, not an averaged observable. Our formula works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a Monte-Carlo algorithm for linear responses.
  We develop a new framework of generative models, DK-SDE, where the model is a parameterized SDE, that (1) directly uses the KL divergence between the empirical data distribution and the marginal density of the SDE as the training objective, and (2) accommodates parametrizations in both drift and diffusion over a long time span, allowing prior structural knowledge to be incorporated explicitly. The optimization is done by gradient-descent enabled by the divergence-kernel method, which involves only forward processes and therefore substantially reduces memory cost. We demonstrate the new model on a 20-dimensional Lorenz system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional billiard systems are Turing complete by encoding their dynamics within the framework of Topological Kleene Field Theory. Billiards serve as idealized models of particle motion with elastic reflections and arise naturally as limits of smooth Hamiltonian systems under steep confining potentials. Our results establish the existence of undecidable trajectories in physically natural billiard-type models, including billiard-type models arising in hard-sphere gases and in collision-chain limits of celestial mechanics.</description>

      <title>Sub-Poissonian estimates for exponential moments of additive functionals over pairs of particles with respect to determinantal and symplectic Pfaffian point processes governed by entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to estimate the tail of the distribution of the number of particles in an interval under determinantal and Pfaffian point processes. The main result of the note is that the square of the number of particles under the determinantal point process whose correlation kernel is an entire function of finite order has sub-Poissonian tails. The same result also holds in the symplectic Pfaffian case. As a corollary, sub-Poissonian estimates are also obtained for exponential moments of additive functionals over pairs of particles.</description>

      <title>Borel graphable equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of analytic equivalence relations which are Borel graphable, i.e. which can be realized as the connectedness relation of a Borel graph. Our main focus is the question of which analytic equivalence relations are Borel graphable. First, we study an equivalence relation arising from the theory of countable admissible ordinals and show that it is Borel graphable if and only if there is a non-constructible real. As a corollary of the proof, we construct an analytic equivalence relation which is (provably in ZFC) not Borel graphable and an effectively analytic equivalence relation which is Borel graphable but not effectively Borel graphable. Next, we study analytic equivalence relations given by the isomorphism relation for some class of countable structures. We show that all such equivalence relations are Borel graphable, which implies that for every Borel action of $S_\infty$, the associated orbit equivalence relation is Borel graphable. This leads us to study the class of Polish groups whose Borel actions always give rise to Borel graphable orbit equivalence relations; we refer to such groups as graphic groups. We show that besides $S_\infty$, the class of graphic groups includes all connected Polish groups and is closed under countable products. We finish by studying structural properties of the class of Borel graphable analytic equivalence relations and by considering two variations on Borel graphability: a generalization with hypegraphs instead of graphs and an analogue of Borel graphability in the setting of computably enumerable equivalence relations.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kovalevskaya exponents of the Riccati hierarchy, deriving the general indicial loci and exponents. A unique commuting vector field is identified, and the general solution is obtained via symmetry reduction. Finally, Laurent series expansions in annular regions are analyzed to reveal the singular structure of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Reversibility in finite-dimensional collapse dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite dimensional quantum systems with arbitrary collapse events, establishing, under no-information-erasure conditions, a structural no-go for trajectory-level operational irreversibility. More precisely, we fix a realization map (a physically admissible selector of the collapse dynamics) and do not rely on any regularity of the induced dynamics. We prove that, for every realization of the collapse dynamics, there exists a topologically closed, forward-invariant subset of the projective state space on which any two states can be connected with arbitrarily fine Fubini-Study precision and arbitrarily small integrated energetic cost. This shows that the preservation of information along a realized branch guarantees islands of quasi-reversibility, while genuine irreversibility requires additional ingredients such as non-compactness, explicit erasure, or coupling to reservoirs.
  KEYWORDS: Quantum collapse dynamics; Quasi-reversibility; Chain-recurrence; Information non-erasure.</description>
