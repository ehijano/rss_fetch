      <title>Influence of Large Mean Delay on Distributed Delay Differential Equations Dynamics: Application to a Neural Mass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay differential equations (DDEs) with large delays play a pivotal role in understanding stability and bifurcations in systems ranging from neural networks to laser dynamics. While prior work has extensively studied DDEs with discrete delays, the impact of distributed delays has been less explored. This paper investigates the spectrum of linear DDEs with a uniformly distributed delay kernel, with mean delay $\tau_m$ and a half-width of $\rho$. When $\tau_m\to\infty$, we carry out asymptotic analysis and show that the spectrum splits into (i) a strong critical spectrum referring to a finite set of isolated, pure imaginary eigenvalues that are unaffected by delay, (ii) an asymptotic strong spectrum consisting of a finite set of eigenvalues with limits that are determined by non-delayed terms in the model and (iii) a pseudo-continuous spectrum consisting of infinitely many eigenvalues that limit on the imaginary axis, with real parts that scale linearly with the delay. Although this behavior is similar to the fixed delay case, the distributed delay introduces additional spectral features, including an infinite countable number of horizontal asymptotes in the pseudo-continuous spectrum at frequencies $\omega= k\pi/\rho$, where $k\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. We validate our theoretical result through several examples and compare our findings with fixed-delay results from the literature. Finally, we apply the results to study the stability and bifurcations of a Wilson-Cowan model with a delayed self-coupling, large mean delay, and homeostatic plasticity.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions of port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider port-Hamiltonian systems from a geometric perspective, where the quantities involved such as state, flows, and efforts evolve in (possibly infinite-dimensional) Banach spaces. The main contribution of this article is the introduction of a weak solution concept. In this framework we show that the derivative of the state naturally lives in a space that, for ordinary evolution equations, plays the role of an extrapolation space. Through examples, we demonstrate that this approach is consistent with the weak solution framework commonly used for partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Misiurewicz points and subhyperbolicity in unicritical algebraic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first definition of \emph{Misiurewicz parameter} for the unicritical family of algebraic correspondences \( z^r + c \), with \( r &gt; 1 \) rational, and prove that, at every Misiurewicz parameter, the correspondence uniformly expands the canonical orbifold metric on a neighborhood of the Julia set. This is achieved using Thurston's ideas on postcritically finite rational maps, regular branched coverings, and orbifolds, viewing the correspondence as a global analytic multifunction.
  This result provides the necessary tools for further investigations into the fine structure of the parameter space near Misiurewicz points, particularly in exploring similarities between the local geometry of the parameter space and the Julia sets at such parameters. Finally, we present both rigorous examples and empirical evidence suggesting that Misiurewicz parameters are abundant and may be detected by identifying increasingly small copies of the Multibrot set nested within itself: the smaller the copy, the closer it is likely to be to a Misiurewicz parameter.</description>

      <title>Mosquito population suppression models with seasonality and d-concave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sterile insect technique has emerged recently as a biologically secure and effective tool for suppressing wild mosquito pests. To improve the performance of this strategy, understanding the interaction between wild and sterile mosquitoes is critical. Although the common models for this biological problem are scalar equations, they are remarkably resistant to the mathematical analysis. In a series of papers, Due\~nas, Nu\~nez, and Obaya have developed a powerful approach to describe the dynamical behavior of scalar equations with d-concave nonlinearities, a property typically related to the sign of the third derivative. In this paper, we show that, for periodic equations coming from population dynamics, this condition is typically associated with the positive sign of the third derivative of the inverse of the Poincar\'e map. This remark allows us to simplify some arguments in the periodic case and obtain a deep geometrical understanding of the global bifurcation patterns. Consequently, the dynamical behavior of the models is analyzed in terms of simple and testable conditions. Our methodology allows us to describe precisely the dynamical behavior of the common mosquito population suppression models, even incorporating seasonality. This paper generalizes and improves many recent results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and Regaining Periodicity in Modular Laplacian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete Laplacians on two-dimensional lattices under modular iterations, focusing on the emergence of nontrivial large-scale patterns. While purely binary or constant modular sequences quickly collapse into strict periodicity, the insertion of a single non-binary step k yields qualitatively new behavior. Through extensive computer-assisted exploration we identify a taxonomy of long-lived figures - rugs, quasi-carpets, and carpets - whose occurrence depends systematically on seed symmetry, neighborhood mask, and sequence structure. In particular, we show that mixed families of the form [2,k,2 to power s] can stabilize high-density carpets beyond the universal decay time characteristic of binary dynamics.
  Our approach combines algebraic replication laws with large-scale simulations and density tracking, producing both theoretical conditions (periodicity via Lucas theorem, non-overlap criteria) and experimental evidence of persistent quasi-aperiodic architectures. The results highlight how minimal modifications in discrete local rules generate unexpectedly rich multiscale geometries, bridging rigorous analysis with computer-assisted discovery.</description>

      <title>From Control to Opinion Dynamics: Signum Consensus Protocol on Arbitrary Weighted Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the signum consensus protocol in continuous-time systems over arbitrary weighted directed graphs with bounded disturbances. The right-hand side of the differential equation is discontinuous on a codimension-$n$ manifold ($n &gt; 1$). On such a manifold, the Filippov sliding vector is not uniquely determined. This results in non-unique solutions and makes the analysis of the system challenging. We define the Polarization Index as the supremum of the growth rate of the difference between the maximum and minimum agent states in the system, derive its closed-form expression, and show that some solution attains this supremum at all forward times except during consensus. From this result, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for consensus and provide a least upper bound on consensus time. To address the high computational complexity of evaluating the Polarization Index, we propose a low-average-complexity algorithm. Finally, we develop an opinion dynamics model grounded in the signum consensus protocol, revealing a fundamental link between dissensus and community structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence theory has been employed by several authors in order to study persistence properties of dynamical systems generated by ordinary differential equations or maps across diverse disciplines. In this note, the author discusses a roadmap to show the persitence of dynamical systems by discussing some problems from literature, which mainly involves either dealing with spectral radius or the Lyapunov exponents.</description>

      <title>Limit Cycles in Piecewise Quadratic Kolmogorov Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study planar piecewise quadratic differential systems of Kolmogorov type. Specifically, we consider systems with both coordinate axes invariant and with a separation line that is straight and distinct from the invariant axes. The main results concern two different aspects. First, the center problem is solved for certain subclasses. Second, using this classification, the bifurcation of limit cycles of crossing type is investigated. We contrast the nature of Hopf-type bifurcations in smooth and piecewise smooth settings, particularly regarding the bifurcation of limit cycles of small amplitude. The classical pseudo-Hopf bifurcation is analyzed in the Kolmogorov systems class. It is worth highlighting that, in contrast to the smooth Kolmogorov quadratic systems, which have no limit cycles, the piecewise case exhibits at least six. Furthermore, we show that the maximal weak focus order, eight, does not necessarily yield the maximal number of small-amplitude limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Analysis of the Displacement Map Some Near Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an alternative method for applying averaging theory of orders $1$ and $2$ in the plane. This is done by combining Taylor expansions of the displacement map with the integral form of the Poincar\'e--Poyntriagin--Melnikov function. It is known that, to obtain results of order $2$ with averaging theory, the first-order averaging function should be identically zero. However, when working with Taylor expansions of the $i$th-order averaging function, we usually cannot guarantee it is identically zero. We prove that the vanishing of certain coefficients of the Taylor series of the first-order averaging function ensures it is identically zero. We present our reasoning in several concrete examples: a quadratic Lotka--Volterra system, a quadratic Hamiltonian system, the entire family of quadratic isochronous differential systems, and a cubic system. For the latter, we also show that a previous analysis contained in the literature is not correct. In none of the examples is it necessary to precisely calculate the averaging functions.</description>

Abstract: Affine cylinders (genus zero surfaces with two singularities) and affine tori (genus one surfaces without singularities) are among the simplest examples of surfaces endowed with a complex affine structure. Their geodesic flows are particularly tractable. In this article, we provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions under which the geodesic flows on such surfaces are conjugate, in the topological and in the holomorphic category.</description>

      <title>Several stronger forms of transitivity in non-autonomous discrete dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the notions of $\Delta$-mixing, $\Delta$-transitivity, mildly mixing, strong multi-transitivity and multi-transitivity with respect to a vector in non-autonomous discrete dynamical systems (NDS). Firstly, we prove that multi-transitivity (strong multi-transitivity, multi-transitivity with respect to a vector, $\Delta$-transitivity, respectively) of NDS is iteration invariants. Then, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained under which an NDS is strongly multi-transitive ($\Delta$-mixing, $\Delta$-transitive, respectively). Besides, we present some counterexamples to justify that the results related to stronger forms of transitivity which are true for autonomous discrete dynamical systems (ADS) but fail in NDS, which show that there is a significant difference between the theory of ADS and the theory of NDS, and establish a sufficient condition under which the results still hold in NDS. Finally, we give a sufficient condition under which multi-transitivity, weakly mixing, weakly mixing of all orders, thick transitivity, $\Delta$-transitivity and strongly multi-transitive are equivalent in NDS.</description>

      <title>A coordinate-independent Pontryagin-Rodygin theorem for slow-fast averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slow drift along a manifold of periodic orbits is a key mathematical structure underlying bursting dynamics in many scientific applications. While classical averaging theory, as formalised by the Pontryagin-Rodygin theorem, provides a leading-order approximation for this slow drift, the connection to the underlying geometry described by Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT)--also known as Fenichel theory--is often not explicit, particularly at higher orders. This paper makes that connection rigorous and constructive using the parametrisation method. We provide a detailed, self-contained exposition of this functional analytic technique, showing how it synthesizes the geometric insight of invariant manifold theory with a systematic, perturbative algorithm. By treating the manifold's embedding and the reduced flow as coupled unknowns, the method provides a constructive proof of an averaged system that is guaranteed to be geometrically consistent with the persistence of the normally hyperbolic manifold to any order. We translate the abstract theory into a concrete computational procedure using Floquet theory, spectral analysis, and the Fredholm alternative, yielding a practical guide for computing high-accuracy, higher-order averaged models, and we demonstrate its implementation, both analytically and numerically, through specific examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discrete random dynamical systems induced by a non-elementary group action on a non-proper hyperbolic space. We prove that if the system is ergodic and satisfies the ``asymptotic past and future independence condition'' as defined by Bader and Furman, the associated ergodic cocycle converges to the Gromov boundary almost surely. If the cocycle has finite first moment, we show that its drift is positive. Using hyperbolic models introduced by Petyt-Spriano-Zalloum, we prove analogous statements for groups acting on Hadamard spaces with a pair of contracting elements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the possible bifurcations of periodic orbits by reducing them to graphs. The aforementioned allows to study the genericity of routes to chaos, as well as to analyze their possible complexity. In particular, our results show that there is no upper bound on the possible complexity. Moreover, it suggests general fermionic description via the virial expansion and universal description via the Rado graph.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric-type inequalities for Mather's $\beta$-function of convex billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss pointwise spectral rigidity results for several billiard systems (e.g., Birkhoff billiards, symplectic billiards and $4$-th billiards), showing that a single value of Mather's $\beta$-function can determine whether a strongly convex smooth planar domain is a disk (or an ellipse, in the affine-invariant case of symplectic billiards). Evoking the famous question "Can you hear the shape of a billiard?", one could say that circular billiards can be heard by a single whisper! More specifically, we prove isoperimetric-type inequalities comparing the $\beta$-function associated to the billiard map of domain to that of a disk with the same perimeter or area, and investigate what are the consequences of having an equality. Surprisingly, this rigidity fails for outer billiards, where explicit counterexamples are constructed for rotation numbers $1/3$ and $1/4$. The results are framed within Aubry-Mather theory and provide a modern dynamical reinterpretation and extension of classical geometric inequalities for extremal polygons.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to the regularity of the Lyapunov exponents for non-compact random Schr\"odinger cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of random Schr\"odinger cocycles showing that, for random cocycles with non-compact support, the presence of certain finite moment conditions is essential for establishing a specific modulus of continuity of the Lyapunov exponent. In particular, H\"older continuity of the Lyapunov exponent requires an exponential moment condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is an overview of recent results on algebraic structures (semigroups, groupoids, algebras, inverse semigroups, and groups) associated with objects with a rich set of partial symmetries. We discuss etale groupoids and inverse semigroups, Steinberg algebras, C*-algebras, topological full groups etc.. In particular, we describe in detail the main definitions and constructions related to contracting self-similar inverse semigroups. They are illustrated by several examples, including the semigroup generated by the golden mean rotation and the tiling semigroup of the Penrose tiling.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cholera Dynamics Under Food Insecurity and Environmental Contamination: A Multi-Patch Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-patch model of cholera transmission integrating environmental contamination, human mobility, and nutritional vulnerability. The population is stratified by food security status, and transmission occurs via human contact, bacteria in the environment and contaminated food. We derive the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ analyze the stability of the disease-free equilibria and show a forward bifurcation. Numerical simulations illustrate how food insecurity amplifies outbreak severity and mortality. The model highlights the role of spatial heterogeneity and socio-environmental factors in shaping cholera dynamics. Moreover, results show the impact of sinks inside starting epidemic.</description>

      <title>Moments of finitary factor maps between Bernoulli processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of what moments can exist for the coding radius of a finitary map between two i.i.d. processes, has been extensively studied in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$-processes. Here we treat this problem for factor maps between $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$-processes ($d&gt;1$). By modeling the homomorphism with a map between spaces of finite sequences, we extend Harvey and Peres' result, showing that for a finitary homomorphism between two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, if the coding radius of the map has a finite $\frac{d}{2}$-moment, then the two processes share the same informational variance. We use our modeling technique to prove a "Schmidt-type theorem" - that in case the above homomorphism has a coding radius of exponential tails, then the two processes are essentially the same. This result appears to be new even for the one-dimensional case, addressing a question of Angel and Spinka.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the Cauchy Problem for First-order Quasilinear Equations with Non-Lipschitz Source Terms and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the first-order quasilinear equations with non-Lipschitz source terms and the global structures of the multi-dimensional Riemann solutions. For such quasilinear equations with initial data in $L^\infty$, when the source term $g(t, x, u)$ is only right-Lipschitz (not necessarily left-Lipschitz) in $u$, we first prove that the Kruzkov entropy condition is sufficient to guarantee the well-posdeness of entropy solutions. Next, we analyze the structures of global multi-dimensional Riemann solutions for scalar conservation laws with non-Lipschitz source terms, where the Riemann-type initial data consist of two different constant states separated by a smooth hypersurface. More precisely, we construct the global multidimensional Riemann solutions with non-selfsimilar structures, including nonselfsimilar shock waves and nonselfsimilar rarefaction waves, and prove that these two kinds of basic waves can be expressed via the implicit functions of functional equation determined by the initial discontinuity, the flux functions, and the non-Lipschitz source term. Moreover, we discover two new phenomena: (i) such kinds of basic waves can disappear in a finite time and (ii) the new-type rarefaction wave can contain some weak discontinuities in its interior. These behaviors are in stark contrast to the case of the Lipschitz source term, where these two kinds of basic waves persist globally and the rarefaction waves remain smooth in the interior. Finally, we provide two examples to respectively demonstrate the uniqueness of Riemann solutions in the case of the source term being non-Lipschitz from left (necessarily right-Lipschitz), and the non-uniqueness of Riemann solutions in the case of the source term being non-Lipschitz from right.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Two Species with Density-Dependent Interactions in a Mutualistic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutualistic interactions, where individuals from different species can benefit from each other, are widespread across ecosystems. This study develops a general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming that mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting individuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two species. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing the ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when the respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary differential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general principles governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the emergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit cycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in strictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for characterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights the effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density dependence.</description>

Abstract: The full family of discrete logistic maps has been widely studied both as a canonical example of the period-doubling route to chaos, and as a model of natural processes. In this paper we present a study of the stochastic process described by iterations of the logistic map with a random parameter. In addition to bringing together previously known results, we present a proof that the unique invariant measure of the process in the chaotic regime is asymptotically stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an expansive homeomorphism, we investigate the relationship among dimension, entropy, and Lyapunov exponents. Motivated by Young's formula for surface diffeomorphisms, which links dimension and measure-theoretic entropy with hyperbolic ergodic measures, we construct the hyperbolic metric with two distinct Lyapunov exponents $\log b&gt;0&gt;-\log a$. We then examine the relationships between various types of entropies (entropy, $r$-neutralized entropy, and $\alpha$-estimating entropy) and dimensions. We further prove the Eckmann-Ruelle Conjecture for expansive topological dynamical systems with hyperbolic metrics. Additionally, we establish variational principles for these entropy quantities.</description>

      <title>Factorizable embeddings and the period of an irreducible sofic shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing a result of MacDonald we give necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift to embed into an irreducible sofic shift factoring through a given cover by an irreducible subshift of finite type (SFT). We obtain also necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift to embed into an irreducible sofic shift factoring through \emph{some} sliding block code out of an irreducible SFT. We do that when the code is required to be surjective, and hence a factor code, and when it is required to be injective or almost invertible, or is allowed to be arbitrary. These results require concepts of the period of an irreducible sofic shift as well as a concept of a $p$-periodic subshift. Several equivalent formulations of the period are developed.</description>

      <title>Dominant vertices and attractors' landscape for Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous works, we introduced the notion of dominant vertices. This is a set of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole network's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case of Boolean networks. We define a reduced graph on the dominant vertices and an induced automata network on this graph, which we prove is asymptotically equivalent to the original Boolean dynamics. Asymptotic conjugacy ensures that the systems, restricted to their respective attractors, are dynamically equivalent. For a significant class of networks, the induced automata network is indeed a reduction of the original system. In these cases, the reduction, which is obtained from the structure of dominant vertices, supplies a more tractable system with the same structure of attractors as the original one. Furthermore, the structure of the induced system allows us to establish bounds on the number and period of the attractors, as well as on the reduction of the basin's sizes and transient lengths. We illustrate this reduction by considering a class of networks, which we call clover networks, whose dominant set is a singleton. To get insight into the structure of the basins of attraction of Boolean networks with a single dominant vertex, we complement this work with a numerical exploration of the behavior of a parametrized ensemble of systems of this kind.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics and Fractal Geometry in Ring Lattice Systems of Nonchaotic Rulkov Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that arise in a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. While networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons have been widely studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. Here, we find that rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular-spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. By systematically varying the electrical coupling strength between neurons, we also uncover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent across the system's dynamical regimes. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's high-dimensional chaotic attractors and find that these attractors can occupy as many as 45 of the 60 dimensions of state space. We further explore how variations in chaotic behavior - quantified by the full Lyapunov spectra - correspond to changes in the attractors' fractal dimensions. This analysis advances our understanding of how complex collective behavior can emerge from the interaction of multiple simple neuron models and highlights the deep interplay between dynamics and geometry in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>The Small-Gain Condition for Infinite Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, attempts have been made to extend ISS small-gain theorems from finite networks to countably infinite networks with finite indegrees. Under specific assumptions about the interconnection gains and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning these assumptions, the results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by a thorough investigation of various monotone operators associated with an infinite network and a specific ISS formulation. Our results generalize the existing theory for finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations, and show which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general case.</description>

      <title>The effect of predation on the dynamics of Chronic Wasting Disease in deer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease impacting deer, elk, moose, and other cervid populations and is caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.</description>
