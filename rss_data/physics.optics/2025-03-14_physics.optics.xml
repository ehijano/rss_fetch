      <title>Polarization-controlled strong light-matter interaction with templated molecular aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction for a layer of templated merocyanine molecules in a planar microcavity. Using a single layer of graphene nanoribbons as a templating layer, we obtain an aligned layer of aggregated molecules. The molecular layer displays anisotropic optical properties resembling those of a biaxial crystal. The anisotropic excitonic component in the cavity results in strongly polarization-dependent light-matter interaction and in increased Rabi-energies. The increased light-matter interaction is possibly due to reduced molecular disorder in the templated molecular layer. This conclusion is supported by an analysis based on a multi-oscillator model. We further use photoluminescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the light-matter coupling is spatially homogeneous. Our study introduces molecular templating to strong light-matter studies. The reduced disorder of the system as a consequence of templating is highly beneficial for engineering light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Categorize coalescing quasi-normal modes through far-field scattering patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances in the form of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) for open scattering systems can be generally identified in the far field through peaks of scattering spectra (\textit{e.g.} cross sections of scattering, extinction and absorption). Nevertheless, when the resonant frequencies of different QNMs are spectrally overlapped or sufficiently close, the scattering peaks merge and it then becomes extremely challenging to reveal the mode constituents underlying the scattering spectra solely in the far field. Here in this work, we study open systems scattering electromagnetic plane waves, and reveal that spectrally close or even overlapped QNMs can be selectively excited through tuning incident directions and polarizations. Such a far-field technique can be further applied to categorize the nature of degenerate QNMs sharing identical complex eigenfrequencies (coalescent eigenvalues): at effectively Hermitian degeneracies (conical or Dirac points), the eigenvectors are not coalescent and thus the QNMs can still be selectively excited, producing distinct scattering patterns; while for non-Hermitian degeneracies (exceptional points), eigenvectors also coalesce and thus selective QNM excitation does not exist, leading to invariant scattering patterns. Our technique sheds new light on the borderlands of Mie theory, QNMs, non-Hermitian photonics and singular optics, which can empower new explorations and applications and cross-fertilize all those disciplines.</description>

      <title>Chiral high-harmonic generation in metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) provides the only source of attosecond pulses with the currently shortest accessible time intervals, and it is employed as the only table-top source of light in extreme UV and soft X-ray spectral regions. Chiral HHG can be employed as an efficient tool for studying the ultrafast response of chiral properties of matter, as well as for amplifying chiroptical effects. Traditionally, chiral high harmonics were associated with gases of enantiomer molecules or, more recently, solid surfaces with helicity in their crystalline structure. Here, we bring the concept of chiral high-harmonic generation to nanophotonics, specifically to metasurfaces consisting of arrays of nanoresonators. Our system is achiral at the material and individual nanoresonators. Chirality rises and falls in a controlled manner via an interplay of the nanoresonator symmetry and the symmetry of the metasurface lattice. Our calculations predict up to 10$^8$ contrast in harmonic brightness between the two orthogonal circular polarizations of the pump. Our findings at the intersection of chiral nanophotonics and strong-field optics pave the way for chiral attosecond physics and chiral extreme UV optics in nanostructured solids.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Terahertz Spectral Bands for Next Generation of Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for high-speed data transmission continues to motivate research and development efforts towards the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication technologies and beyond. The use of terahertz (THz) carrier frequencies is considered to achieve faster data transmission rates, with the potential to reach terabits per second. However, there is a necessity to study the impact of environmental factors affecting the signal transmission at these frequencies. One key challenge of THz signal propagation through air is water vapor absorption, which can severely limit the broadcast distance of THz wireless communications. In this work, we investigate the propagation distance of several THz channels under 35 % relative humidity atmospheric conditions using a table-top THz spectroscopy apparatus equipped with a sensitive THz detection system based on nonlinear parametric upconversion. Our results show seven transmission bands between 1 and 3 THz with negligible signal absorption at different propagation lengths with potential application in short-, mid- and long-range wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Structure of the Brunel spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic emissions, known as Brunel radiations, are produced in plasmas through the coupling between the free electron density and ultrafast ionizing laser pulses. The radiation spectrum generated in laser-gas interactions is here investigated from a local current model for laser drivers with two frequency components - or "colors" - being not necessarily integers of one another. We provide a general description of this spectrum by deriving analytically the convolution product of the Fourier transforms of the electron density and of the laser electric field. Our analysis reveals that the only knowledge of the optical field extrema in time domain is sufficient to reproduce faithfully the numerically-computed Brunel spectrum and justify the emergence of various resonance frequencies. The classical combination of two laser harmonics, i.e., a fundamental and its second harmonic, is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Theory of the two-photon Franz-Keldysh effect and electric-field-induced bichromatic coherent control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of a constant electric field on two-photon absorption in a semiconductor is calculated using an independent-particle theory. The theoretical framework is an extension of a theory of the one-photon Franz-Keldysh effect [Wahlstrand and Sipe, Phys. Rev. B 82, 075206 (2010)]. The theory includes the effect of the constant field, including field-induced coupling between closely spaced bands, in the electronic wavefunctions and calculates optical absorption perturbatively. Numerical calculations are performed using a 14-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot\mathbf{p}$ band structure model for GaAs. For all nonzero tensor elements, field-enabled two-photon absorption (TPA) below the band gap and Franz-Keldysh oscillations in the TPA spectrum are predicted, with a generally larger effect in tensor elements with more components parallel to the constant electric field direction. Some tensor elements that are zero in the absence of a field become nonzero in the presence of the constant electric field and depend on its sign. Notably, these elements are linear in the electric field to lowest order and may be substantial away from band structure critical points at room temperature and/or with a non-uniform field. Electric-field-induced changes in the carrier injection rate due to interference between one- and two-photon absorption are also calculated. The electric field enables this bichromatic coherent control process for polarization configurations where it is normally forbidden, and also modifies the spectrum of the process for configurations where it is allowed by crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Two-photon spectroscopy and a verification of the Kennard-Stepanov relation in high-pressure two-species xenon-noble gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between the absorption and the emission spectral lineshapes of dense atomic and molecular media, such as dye solutions and alkali-noble buffer gas mixtures at high pressure, in many cases there exists a universal scaling, the Kennard-Stepanov relation, which is a manifestation of detailed balance. This relation plays a crucial role in recent Bose-Einstein condensation experiments of visible-spectral-photons in e.g. dye-solution-filled optical microcavities. It has recently been proposed to use high-pressure xenon-noble gas mixtures as a thermalization medium for vacuum-ultraviolet regime photons, so as to extend the achievable wavelength range of such Bose-Einstein-condensed optical sources from the visible to the vacuum-ultraviolet regime. In this work, we report two-photon excitation spectroscopy measurements of ground state ($5p^6$) xenon atoms subject to up to 80bar of helium or krypton buffer gas pressure, respectively, in the 220nm - 260nm wavelength range. The study of such two-photon spectra is of interest e.g. for the exploration of possible pumping schemes of a future vacuum-ultraviolet photon Bose-Einstein condensate. We have also recorded absorption and emission spectra of the $5p^6 \leftrightarrow 5p^56s$ single-photon transition near 147nm wavelength of xenon atoms subject to 80bar of krypton buffer gas pressure. We find that the ratio of absorption and emission follows a Kennard-Stepanov scaling, which suggests that such gas mixtures are promising candidates as a thermalization medium for a Bose-Einstein condensate of vacuum-ultraviolet photons.</description>

      <title>A high-speed heterogeneous lithium tantalate silicon photonics platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has driven the demand for faster optical components in data centres to unprecedented levels. A key advancement in this field is the integration of multiple photonic components onto a single chip, enhancing the performance of optical transceivers. Here, silicon photonics, benefiting from mature fabrication processes, has gained prominence. The platform combines modulators, switches, photodetectors and low-loss waveguides on a single chip. However, emerging standards like 1600ZR+ potentially exceed the capabilities of silicon-based modulators. To address these limitations, thin-film lithium niobate has been proposed as an alternative to silicon photonics, offering a low voltage-length product and exceptional high-speed modulation properties. More recently, the first demonstrations of thin-film lithium tantalate circuits have emerged, addressing some of the disadvantages of lithium niobate enabling a reduced bias drift and enhanced resistance to optical damage. As such, making it a promising candidate for next-generation photonic platforms. However, a persistent drawback of such platforms is the lithium contamination, which complicates integration with CMOS fabrication processes. Here, we present for the first time the integration of lithium tantalate onto a silicon photonics chip. This integration is achieved without modifying the standard silicon photonics process design kit. Our device achieves low half-wave voltage (3.5 V), low insertion loss (2.9 dB) and high-speed operation (&gt; 70 GHz), paving the way for next-gen applications. By minimising lithium tantalate material use, our approach reduces costs while leveraging existing silicon photonics technology advancements, in particular supporting ultra-fast monolithic germanium photodetectors and established process design kits.</description>

      <title>Light Drag in a Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term "light dragging" describes how the trajectory of light changes as it travels through a moving medium. This phenomenon facilitates the precise detection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum gate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the existence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.</description>

      <title>A PyTorch-Enabled Tool for Synthetic Event Camera Data Generation and Algorithm Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event, or neuromorphic cameras, offer a novel encoding of natural scenes by asynchronously reporting significant changes in brightness, known as events, with improved dynamic range, temporal resolution and lower data bandwidth when compared to conventional cameras. However, their adoption in domain-specific research tasks is hindered in part by limited commercial availability, lack of existing datasets, and challenges related to predicting the impact of their nonlinear optical encoding, unique noise model and tensor-based data processing requirements. To address these challenges, we introduce Synthetic Events for Neural Processing and Integration (SENPI) in Python, a PyTorch-based library for simulating and processing event camera data. SENPI includes a differentiable digital twin that converts intensity-based data into event representations, allowing for evaluation of event camera performance while handling the non-smooth and nonlinear nature of the forward model The library also supports modules for event-based I/O, manipulation, filtering and visualization, creating efficient and scalable workflows for both synthetic and real event-based data. We demonstrate SENPI's ability to produce realistic event-based data by comparing synthetic outputs to real event camera data and use these results to draw conclusions on the properties and utility of event-based perception. Additionally, we showcase SENPI's use in exploring event camera behavior under varying noise conditions and optimizing event contrast threshold for improved encoding under target conditions. Ultimately, SENPI aims to lower the barrier to entry for researchers by providing an accessible tool for event data generation and algorithmic developmnent, making it a valuable resource for advancing research in neuromorphic vision systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear, semiclassical dynamics of an open spin-1 (three-level) variant of the traditional Dicke model. In particular, we focus on V-type energy-level configurations with varying degrees of energy-level asymmetry. We also allow for unbalanced coupling -- where co-rotating and counter-rotating Hamiltonian terms are independently tunable. We characterise the system with a dynamical systems approach, where different behaviors map to definite dynamical objects, and phase transitions to bifurcations. We find the emergence of both periodic and two-frequency oscillations, as well as multistability and chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of the acoustic Purcell effect with a color-center and a nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</description>

Abstract: We present an optomechanical device platform for characterization of optical, thermal, and rheological properties of fluids on the micron scale. A suspended silicon microdisk resonator with a vibrating mass of 100 fg and an effective measurement volume of less than a pL is used to monitor properties of different fluids at rest. By employing analytical models for thermo-optical effects, thermal diffusion and fluid-structure interactions, our platform determines the refractive index, thermal conductivity, viscosity, density and compressibility of the fluid, in a compact measurement setup. A single measurement takes as short as 70 microseconds, and the employed power can be less than 100 microwatts, guaranteeing measurement at rest and in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for non-Hermitian approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses driven by complex frequency excitations. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are sensitive to the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work paves the way for a rigorous understanding of non-Hermitian physics in quantum systems and their experimental verification through complex frequency-domain techniques.</description>

      <title>Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industry applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films. Gracing incident x-ray geometry has been also used to look to distortion dynamics, but this technique is only sensitive to the surface of bulk materials with a limited temporal resolution. However, 'real-world' processing applications deal mostly with bulk materials, which prevent the use of such techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon single-pulse excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of the temporal evolution of ultrafast distortion depth profiles. Our measurements were obtained in a thin crystalline Si wafer upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation revealing that even below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions appear on ps time scales due to the formation and propagation of high-amplitude strain waves into the bulk.</description>

      <title>Solving Dicke superradiance analytically: A compendium of methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Dicke superradiance problem, namely the time evolution of the density operator for an initially inverted ensemble of $N$ identical two-level systems (spins), undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This is one of the simplest examples of an open quantum system dynamics problem that admits a fully analytical solution. We provide a few different approaches to derive the analytical solution valid for any time during the evolution and for any number of spins. These approaches range from solving a set of coupled rate equations, to observing exceptional points stemming from non-Hermitian evolution, to the use of combinatorics and probabilistic methods, and finally to utilizing techniques based on the quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The solution is expressed as a residue sum stemming from a contour integral in the complex plane and suggests the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a wider range of quantum open system dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>Proposed optomechanical systems based on luminescence-induced optical forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an optomechanical system utilizing luminescence-induced optical forces (LIOFs). Anisotropic dielectric structures enhance the recoil force from the luminescence. The optomechanical resonator consists of a composite film with a dielectric membrane, luminescent nanofilm, and a metallic substrate. The LIOF causes a mechanical frequency shift in the oscillator known as the optical spring effect. These results link the quantum properties of luminescent nanomaterials with those of other quantum-mechanical systems with vastly different frequency regimes via induced vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modulation of dual-band nonreciprocal radiation in a graphene-Weyl semimetal plasmonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and develop a hybrid structure combining graphene and Weyl semimetal, capable of achieving dynamically adjustable dual-band nonreciprocal radiation. The results reveal that the nonreciprocal radiation can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between resonance mode excitation and the unique properties of Weyl materials, with the electric field distribution providing further insights into the graphene plasmon modes involved. By exploiting the resonant characteristics of graphene plasmons, we demonstrate that strong nonreciprocal radiation can be effectively regulated through adjusting the grating's geometric parameters, while maintaining robustness over a wide range. Notably, substantial dynamic tuning of the resonant wavelength for nonreciprocal radiation is achievable by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. Our research results offer promising prospects for the developing of complex energy harvesting and conversion systems within advanced thermal frameworks.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Network for Photon-Level Block Compressed Sensing Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal deep learning network for photon-level Block Compressed Sensing Imaging, aimed to address challenges such as signal loss, artifacts, and noise interference in large-pixel dynamic imaging and tracking at the photon level. This approach combines information in the time and frequency domains with a U-Net-LSTM deep learning model, significantly improving the restoration quality of dynamic target images at high frame rates. The experimental results demonstrate that dynamic target imaging with an average photon number of less than 10 per pixel can be achieved using 16-channel parallel detection, where the pixel size is 256*256 and the frame rate is 200 fps.. Compared to conventional Block Compressed Sensing Imaging, this method increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio to 38.66 dB and improves the structural similarity index to 0.96. In the presence of a dynamic scattering medium and a static complex background, we successfully achieved imaging and tracking of two targets undergoing complex motion. Even in scenarios where the targets overlap or obstruct each other, we can still reconstruct clear images of each individual target separately.. This method provides an effective solution for large-pixel dynamic target recognition, tracking, and real-time imaging in complex environments, offering promising applications in remote sensing, military reconnaissance, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons are conclusive and direct witnesses of higher-than-quadratic nonlinearities in optical and mechanical processes. Moreover, they are proven resources for quantum sensing, communication and error correction with diverse continuous-variable systems. This review introduces theoretical analyses of nonclassical and quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons. It recapitulates approaches used to derive operational criteria for photons tolerant to optical losses, their application in experiments and their nowadays extension to quantum non-Gaussian photon coincidences. It extends to a recent comparison of quantum non-Gaussianity, including robustness to thermal noise, and sensing capability for high-quality phononic Fock states of single trapped cooled ions. The review can stimulate further development in the criteria of quantum non-Gaussian states and experimental effort to prepare and detect such useful features, navigating the community to advanced quantum physics and technology.</description>

      <title>Sub-wavelength optical lattice in 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent non-equilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a ``non-local" pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe$_2$, several microns away from the illumination spot. Remarkably, we identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons' linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced multichannel dual-comb spectroscopy of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multichannel dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) approach for high-resolution, broadband spectral measurements is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying complex atomic systems. By implementing a photodetector array, we enhance DCS capabilities, addressing the fundamental trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral coverage. To resolve ambiguities in frequency conversion, we introduced a relative offset in the radio frequency (RF) comb teeth, ensuring accurate spectral reconstruction. As a proof of concept, the absorption spectrum of samarium (Sm) vapor is investigated over a 52nm range, and several previously unreported absorption lines are detected. This is a step toward "Spectroscopy 2.0", enabling massively parallel spectroscopic measurements (including those at &gt;100 T magnetic fields) crucial for atomic physics and fundamental interactions research.</description>
