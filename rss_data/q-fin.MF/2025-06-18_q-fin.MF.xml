      <title>Robust Hedging of American Options via Aggregated Snell Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an aggregator for a family of Snell envelopes in a nondominated framework. We apply this construction to establish a robust hedging duality, along with the existence of a minimal hedging strategy, in a general semi-martingale setting for American-style options. Our results encompass continuous processes, or processes with jumps and non-vanishing diffusion. A key application is to financial market models, where uncertainty is quantified through the semi-martingale characteristics.</description>

      <title>On Quantum BSDE Solver for High-Dimensional Parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum machine learning framework for approximating solutions to high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that can be reformulated as backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In contrast to popular quantum-classical network hybrid approaches, this study employs the pure Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) as the core solver without trainable classical neural networks. The quantum BSDE solver performs pathwise approximation via temporal discretization and Monte Carlo simulation, framed as model-based reinforcement learning. We benchmark VQCbased and classical deep neural network (DNN) solvers on two canonical PDEs as representatives: the Black-Scholes and nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The VQC achieves lower variance and improved accuracy in most cases, particularly in highly nonlinear regimes and for out-of-themoney options, demonstrating greater robustness than DNNs. These results, obtained via quantum circuit simulation, highlight the potential of VQCs as scalable and stable solvers for highdimensional stochastic control problems.</description>

      <title>Pricing options on the cryptocurrency futures contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cryptocurrency options market is notable for its high volatility and lower liquidity compared to traditional markets. These characteristics introduce significant challenges to traditional option pricing methodologies. Addressing these complexities requires advanced models that can effectively capture the dynamics of the market. We explore which option pricing models are most effective in valuing cryptocurrency options. Specifically, we calibrate and evaluate the performance of the Black-Scholes, Merton Jump Diffusion, Variance Gamma, Kou, Heston, and Bates models. Our analysis focuses on pricing vanilla options on futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). We find that the Black-Scholes model exhibits the highest pricing errors. In contrast, the Kou and Bates models achieve the lowest errors, with the Kou model performing the best for the BTC options and the Bates model for ETH options. The results highlight the importance of incorporating jumps and stochastic volatility into pricing models to better reflect the behavior of these assets.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust risk evaluation with a causality constraint and structural information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10571v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the distributionally robust evaluation of expected values over temporal data. A set of alternative measures is characterized by the causal optimal transport. We prove the strong duality and recast the causality constraint as minimization over an infinite-dimensional test function space. We approximate test functions by neural networks and prove the sample complexity with Rademacher complexity. An example is given to validate the feasibility of technical assumptions. Moreover, when structural information is available to further restrict the ambiguity set, we prove the dual formulation and provide efficient optimization methods. Our framework outperforms the classic counterparts in the distributionally robust portfolio selection problem. The connection with the naive strategy is also investigated numerically.</description>

      <title>Simulation of square-root processes made simple: applications to the Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, efficient and accurate nonnegative preserving numerical scheme for simulating the square-root process. The novel idea is to simulate the integrated square-root process first instead of the square-root process itself. Numerical experiments on realistic parameter sets, applied for the integrated process and the Heston model, display high precision with a very low number of time steps. As a bonus, our scheme yields the exact limiting Inverse Gaussian distributions of the integrated square-root process with only one single time-step in two scenarios: (i) for high mean-reversion and volatility-of-volatility regimes, regardless of maturity; and (ii) for long maturities, independent of the other parameters.</description>
