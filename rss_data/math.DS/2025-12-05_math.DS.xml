      <title>Nonsmooth bifurcations in families of one-dimensional piecewise-linear quasiperiodically forced maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonsmooth bifurcations of four types of families of one-dimensional quasiperiodically forced maps of the form $F_i(x,\theta) = (f_i(x,\theta), \theta+\omega)$ for $i=1,\dots,4$, where $x$ is real, $\theta\in\mathbb{T}$ is an angle, $\omega$ is an irrational frequency, and $f_i(x,\theta)$ is a real piecewise linear map with respect to $x$. The first two types of families $f_i$ have a symmetry with respect to $x$, and the other two could be viewed as quasiperiodically forced piecewise-linear versions of saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations. The four types of families depend on two real parameters, $a\in\mathbb{R}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}$. Under certain assumptions for $a$, we prove the existence of a continuous map $b^*(a)$ where for $b=b^*(a)$ there exists a nonsmooth bifurcation for these types of systems. In particular we prove that for $b=b^*(a)$ we have a strange nonchaotic attractor. It is worth to mention that the four families are piecewise-linear versions of smooth families which seem to have nonsmooth bifurcations. Moreover, as far as we know, we give the first example of a family with a nonsmooth period-doubling bifurcation.</description>

      <title>McMullen's game for equicontinuously-twisted badly approximable points in continued fractions and beta expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a beta-transformation (for integer beta) or a Gauss map system, given a sequence of functions fn from [0,1] to itself, consider the collection of points in [0,1] whose nth iteration under the map is distanced away from its value under fn. It is well known that for constant sequences fn, such collections are always winning in McMullen's game and in particular they have Hausdorff dimension 1. We extend the results to all equicontinuous sequences of functions fn.</description>

      <title>Measure of maximal entropy for H-flows on non-compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a natural class of chaotic flows on non-compact manifolds, called H-flows, which includes geodesic flows on non-compact manifolds with pinched negative curvature. We show that, under the additional assumption, called strong positive recurrence, that their entropy at infinity is strictly smaller than the topological entropy, such flows admit an invariant probability measure maximizing entropy. In particular, we compare several notions of entropy in a non-compact setting.</description>

      <title>Partial section I: $\alpha$-recurrence and equivariant Lyapunov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first article in a series that aims at classifying partial sections of flows, that is a general family of transverse surfaces. In this part, we deal with the dynamical aspect of the question.
  Given a flow on a compact manifold $M$ and a cohomology class $\alpha$ of rank 1, we give a criterion for the existence of an $\alpha$-equivariant Lyapunov map on an Abelian covering of $M$ associated to $\alpha$.
  One important aspect of the existence of such Lyapunov maps, and of the classification of partial sections, is a type of recurrence set relative to $\alpha$. We describe how that set depends on $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Analytic Dependence of the Lyapunov Moment Function and the Projective Stationary Measure for Random Matrix Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the product of i.i.d. random matrices sampled according to a probability measure $\mu$ supported on a strongly irreducible and proximal subset of a compact set $S\subset GL(d,\mathbb{R})$. We establish the local analyticity of the Lyapunov moment function and the unique stationary measure on the projective space with respect to $\mu$ in the total variation topology. As a consequence, we obtain the analyticity of the asymptotic variance and all higher-order Lyapunov moments.</description>

      <title>Mixing at the Batchelor Scale for White-In-Time Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mixing properties of solutions to the advection-diffusion equation of a white-in-time velocity field on the 2-dimensional torus with four forced modes. As the diffusivity parameter goes to zero, we show that the almost-sure exponential dissipation rate stays bounded from below. Together with the corresponding upper bound established by Gess and Yaroslavtsev, this constitutes an example of a velocity field for which the Batchelor scale conjecture can be verified. In addition, we characterize the exponential mixing rate without diffusion of this system. Our results are not restricted to two dimensions, and we construct a three-dimensional white-in-time velocity field with the same properties.</description>

      <title>RNNs perform task computations by dynamically warping neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.</description>

      <title>Essential dimensions of polarized endomorphisms of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a polarized endomorphism of an abelian variety $A$. Koll\'ar and Zhuang asked whether the essential dimension $\mathrm{ed}(f)$ equals $\mathrm{dim}(A)$. We provide counterexamples to this question. Instead, we prove that, under the hypothesis that every subtorus of $A$ is $f$-preperiodic up to translation (a condition arising from the dynamical Manin--Mumford conjecture), we have $\mathrm{ed}(f^s)=\mathrm{dim}(A)$ for some integer $s&gt;0$. Our examples also show the necessity of both the hypothesis and iteration. We also give an affirmative answer to Koll\'ar and Zhuang's original question when $A$ is a simple abelian surface and $f$ is not $2$-polarized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study normal forms of analytic saddle-nodes in $\mathbb C^{n+1}$ with any Poincar\'e rank $k\in \mathbb N$. The approach and the results generalize those of Bonckaert and De Maesschalck from 2008 that considered $k=1$. In particular, we introduce a Banach convolutional algebra that is tailored to study differential equations in the Borel plane of order $k$. One of the subtleties that we take care of in this paper, is that nontrivial Jordan blocks are allowed in the linear part of the vector field. We anticipate that our approach can stimulate new research and be used to study different normal forms in future work.</description>

Abstract: Let $\gamma_{n}= O (\log^{-c}n)$ and let $\nu$ be the infinite product measure whose $n$-th marginal is Bernoulli$(1/2+\gamma_{n})$. We show that $c=1/2$ is the threshold, above which $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic in the sense of Peres-Weiss, and below which this can fail. This provides a range in which $\nu$ is singular with respect to the uniform product measure, but $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic.</description>

      <title>Structural Asymmetry and Rigidity of Bounded Solutions for a Parametrized Complex Linear Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of parametrized non-homogeneous linear complex differential equations on $[1,\infty)$, depending on a complex parameter $w$ in the strip $\Re(w)\in(0,1)$. Their dynamics encodes subtle asymptotic features of a real bounded forcing term. Under a mild integrability condition, we establish a rigidity phenomenon: for every parameter $w$ with $\Re(w) \in (0,1)\setminus\{\tfrac12\}$, the two solutions corresponding respectively to $w$ and $1-\bar w$, both taken with initial condition $1$, cannot be simultaneously bounded on $[1,+\infty)$. This result provides an answer to the Dynamical Conjecture formulated in [arXiv:2112.05521] and highlights a structural asymmetry in the solutions' dependence on the complex parameter, thereby contributing to a better understanding of the qualitative behavior of this class of differential systems.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary, non-convex-cocompact Kleinian group acting on $\mathbb{H}^{d}$. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the sublinearly conical Myrberg limit set of $\Gamma$ is equal to the critical exponent of $\Gamma$. This gives a different proof of a theorem by M. Mj and W. Yang. Along the way, we construct subsemigroups of $\Gamma$ of divergence type and develop the Patterson--Sullivan theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for continuous-time quantum Markov semigroups: the detailed balance condition, entropy, pressure and equilibrium quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ denotes the set of $n$ by $n$ complex matrices. Consider continuous time quantum semigroups $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$, where $\mathcal{L}:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the infinitesimal generator. If we assume that $\mathcal{L}(I)=0$, we will call $e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$ a quantum Markov semigroup. Given a stationary density matrix $\rho= \rho_{\mathcal{L}}$, for the quantum Markov semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t$, $t \geq 0$, we can define a continuous time stationary quantum Markov process, denoted by $X_t$, $t \geq 0.$ Given an {\it a priori} Laplacian operator $\mathcal{L}_0:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$, we will present a natural concept of entropy for a class of density matrices on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Given an Hermitian operator $A:\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n$ (which plays the role of an Hamiltonian), we will study a version of the variational principle of pressure for $A$. A density matrix $\rho_A$ maximizing pressure will be called an equilibrium density matrix. From $\rho_A$ we will derive a new infinitesimal generator $\mathcal{L}_A$. Finally, the continuous time quantum Markov process defined by the semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}_A}$, $t \geq 0$, and an initial stationary density matrix, will be called the continuous time equilibrium quantum Markov process for the Hamiltonian $A$. It corresponds to the quantum thermodynamical equilibrium for the action of the Hamiltonian $A$.</description>

      <title>The total spine of the Milnor fibration of a plane curve singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any plane curve singularity defined by an analytic function germ $f$, we construct a spine on each Milnor fiber simultaneously, that realizes the vanishing topology. In order to do so, we study the separatrices at the origin of the vector field $-\nabla \log |f|$. Under some genericity conditions on the metric, we produce a natural partition of the set of separatrices, $S$, into a finite collection smooth strata. As a byproduct of this theory, we construct a smooth fibration which is equivalent to the Milnor fibration, and lives on a quotient of the Milnor fibration at radius $0$. The strict transform of $S$ in this space induces the aforementioned spine for each fiber of this fibration. These fibers are naturally endowed with a vector field in such a way that the spine consists of trajectories which do not escape through the boundary.</description>

Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincar\'e map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs distant circumterrestrial orbits.</description>

      <title>Fractal failures of Ratner rigidity in higher rank geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem shows that in a locally symmetric space of noncompact type and finite volume, every immersed totally geodesic subspace of noncompact type is topologically rigid: its closure is an immersed submanifold.
  We construct the first explicit higher-rank, infinite-volume examples in which this rigidity fails, via floating geodesic planes. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains a sequence of immersed floating geodesic planes with fractal closures whose Hausdorff dimensions, non-integral, accumulate at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  Our method uses Goldman's bulging deformations, but in higher rank new difficulties arise: unlike in rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane always diverge, here one must analyze the collective behavior of entire families of parallel geodesics inside flats under bulging, a phenomenon intrinsic to higher rank.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of Markov shifts: part II-LLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Local Central Limit Theorems (LLT) for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is a Markov chains with equicontinuous conditional probabilities satisfying contraction conditions close in spirit to Dobrushin's, and some ``physicality" assumptions and $f_j$ are equicontinuous functions. Our conditions will always be in force when the chain takes values on a metric space and have uniformly bounded away from $0$ backward transition densities with respect to a measure which assigns uniform positive mass to certain ``balls".
  This paper complements \cite{MarShif1} where Berry-Esseen theorems, were proven for (not necessarily continuous) functions satisfying certain approximation conditions. Our results address a question posed by D. Dolgopyat and O. Sarig in \cite[Section 1.5]{DS}.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>
