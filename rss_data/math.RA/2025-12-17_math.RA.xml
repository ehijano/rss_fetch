      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Tensor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for recovering paths from their third-order signature tensors, an inverse problem in rough analysis. Our algorithm provides the exact solution to this learning problem and improves upon current approaches by an order of magnitude. It relies on symbolic multilinear algebra and stabilizers of group actions via matrix-tensor congruence. We apply randomized transformation techniques that avoid the task of solving nonlinear polynomial systems associated to degenerate paths, and accompany our methods with an efficient implementation in the computer algebra system OSCAR.</description>

      <title>The theory of implicit operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of partial functions of a class of algebras $\mathsf{K}$ is said to be an implicit operation of $\mathsf{K}$ when it is defined by a first order formula and it is preserved by homomorphisms. In this work, we develop the theory of implicit operations from an algebraic standpoint.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic transformations over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel cryptographic paradigm based on nonderived polyadic algebraic structures. Traditional cryptosystems rely on binary operations within groups, rings, or fields, whose well-understood properties can be exploited in cryptanalysis. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we propose a shift to polyadic rings, which generalize classical rings by allowing operations of higher arity: an $m$-ary addition and an $n$-ary multiplication. The foundation of our approach is the construction of polyadic integers -- congruence classes of ordinary integers endowed with such $m$-ary and $n$-ary operations. A key innovation is the parameter-to-arity mapping $\Phi(a,b)=(m,n)$, which links the parameters $(a,b)$ defining a congruence class to the specific arities required for algebraic closure. This mapping is mathematically intricate: it is non-injective, non-surjective, and multivalued. This complex, non-unique relationship forms the core of the proposed cryptosystem's security. We present two concrete encryption procedures that leverage this structure by encoding plaintext within the parameters of polyadic rings and transmitting information via polyadically quantized analog signals. In one method, plaintext is linked to the additive arity $m_{i}$ and secured using the summation of such signals; in the other, it is linked to a ring parameter $a_{i}$ and secured using their multiplication. In both cases, the "quantized" nature of polyadic operations generates systems of equations that are straightforward for a legitimate recipient with the correct key but exceptionally difficult for an attacker without it. The resulting framework promises a substantial increase in cryptographic security. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for this new class of encryption schemes and highlights their potential for constructing robust, next-generation cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient criterion for the solvability of $\operatorname{HH}^1(kP)$ as a Lie algebra, where $P$ is a $p$-group with $p$ odd, in terms of a directed graph constructed from the group $P$. This gives non-trivial results on the structure of such Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>The Equational Theories Project: Advancing Collaborative Mathematical Research at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the Equational Theories Project (ETP), an online collaborative pilot project to explore new ways to collaborate in mathematics with machine assistance. The project successfully determined all 22 028 942 edges of the implication graph between the 4694 simplest equational laws on magmas, by a combination of human-generated and automated proofs, all validated by the formal proof assistant language Lean. As a result of this project, several new constructions of magmas satisfying specific laws were discovered, and several auxiliary questions were also addressed, such as the effect of restricting attention to finite magmas.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interlacing Families: New Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of generalized interlacing families of polynomials, which extends the classical interlacing polynomial method to handle polynomials of varying degrees. We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.</description>

Abstract: Following Kantor's procedure, we construct the Kantor double of Virasoro-like algebra and delve into the study of transposed Poisson structures on this Lie superalgebra. Our findings establish that it lacks non-trivial 1/2 -derivations, and therefore, it does not exhibit a non-trivial transposed Poisson algebra structure.</description>

      <title>The Phantom of Davis-Wielandt Shell: A Unified Framework for Graphical Stability Analysis of MIMO LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell for graphical stability analysis of multi-input and multi-output linear time-invariant feedback systems. Connections between DW shells and various graphical representations, as well as gain and phase measures, are established through an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we map the relationships and relative conservatism among various separation conditions. A rotated scaled relative graph ($\theta$-SRG) concept is proposed as a mixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion is derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D graphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops. We also propose a reliable and generalizable algorithm for visualizing the $\theta$-SRGs and include a system example to demonstrate the reduced conservatism of the proposed condition.</description>

      <title>Linear Codes with Certain Dimension of Hermitian Hulls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the enumerative and asymptotic properties related to Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes on the unitary space over $\F_{q^2}$. We provide some closed form expressions for the counting formulas of Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes. There is a similarity in the asymptotic weight distribution between Hermitian self-orthogonal codes and unrestricted codes. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes whose minimum distance is at least $d$. In particular, we conclude that MDS codes within the class of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes are asymptotically dense when the alphabet size approaches to infinity.</description>

      <title>Intervals of torsion pairs and generalized Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} tilting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category with a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$. Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting provides a method to construct a new abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ with a torsion pair associated to $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$, which is exactly the heart of a certain $t$-structure on the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories.</description>
