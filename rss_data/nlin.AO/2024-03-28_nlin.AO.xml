      <title>On the Salient Limitations of `On the Salient Limitations of the Methods of Assembly Theory and their Classification of Molecular Biosignatures'</title>

Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>

      <title>Neural Downscaling for Complex Systems: from Large-scale to Small-scale by Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting and understanding the chaotic dynamics in complex systems is essential in various applications. However, conventional approaches, whether full-scale simulations or small-scale omissions, fail to offer a comprehensive solution. This instigates exploration into whether modeling or omitting small-scale dynamics could benefit from the well-captured large-scale dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology called Neural Downscaling (ND), which integrates neural operator techniques with the principles of inertial manifold and nonlinear Galerkin theory. ND effectively infers small-scale dynamics within a complementary subspace from corresponding large-scale dynamics well-represented in a low-dimensional space. The effectiveness and generalization of the method are demonstrated on the complex systems governed by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations. As the first comprehensive deterministic model targeting small-scale dynamics, ND sheds light on the intricate spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, revealing how small-scale dynamics are intricately linked with and influenced by large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Natural-artificial hybrid swarm: Cyborg-insect group navigation in unknown obstructed soft terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating multi-robot systems in complex terrains has always been a challenging task. This is due to the inherent limitations of traditional robots in collision avoidance, adaptation to unknown environments, and sustained energy efficiency. In order to overcome these limitations, this research proposes a solution by integrating living insects with miniature electronic controllers to enable robotic-like programmable control, and proposing a novel control algorithm for swarming. Although these creatures, called cyborg insects, have the ability to instinctively avoid collisions with neighbors and obstacles while adapting to complex terrains, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. In response to this issue, we propose a novel swarm navigation algorithm addressing these challenges. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an experimental validation in which a cyborg swarm was successfully navigated through an unknown sandy field with obstacles and hills. This research contributes to the domain of swarm robotics and showcases the potential of integrating biological organisms with robotics and control theory to create more intelligent autonomous systems with real-world applications.</description>
