      <title>The stabilizing role of multiplicative noise in non-confining potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a simple framework for the study of parametric (multiplicative) noise, making use of scale parameters. We show that for a large class of stochastic differential equations increasing the multiplicative noise intensity surprisingly causes the mass of the stationary probability distribution to become increasingly concentrated around the minima of the multiplicative noise term, whilst under quite general conditions exhibiting a kind of intermittent burst like jumps between these minima. If the multiplicative noise term has one zero this causes on-off intermittency. Our framework relies on first term expansions, which become more accurate for larger noise intensities. In this work we show that the full width half maximum in addition to the maximum is appropriate for quantifying the stationary probability distribution (instead of the mean and variance, which are often undefined). We define a corresponding new kind of weak sense stationarity. We consider a double well potential as an example of application, demonstrating relevance to tipping points in noisy systems.</description>

      <title>Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: information theory and state variables for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of statistical physics concepts such as entropy extends far beyond classical thermodynamics. We interpret the similarity between partitions in statistical mechanics and partitions in Bayesian inference as an articulation of a result by Jaynes (1957), who clarified that thermodynamics is in essence a theory of information. In this, every sampling process has a mechanical analogue. Consequently, the divide between ensembles of samplers in parameter space and sampling from a mechanical system in thermodynamic equilibrium would be artificial. Based on this realisation, we construct a continuous modelling of a Bayes update akin to a transition between thermodynamic ensembles. This leads to an information theoretic interpretation of Jazinsky's equality, relating the expenditure of work to the influence of data via the likelihood. We propose one way to transfer the vocabulary and the formalism of thermodynamics (energy, work, heat) and statistical mechanics (partition functions) to statistical inference, starting from Bayes' law. Different kinds of inference processes are discussed and relative entropies are shown to follow from suitably constructed partitions as an analytical formulation of sampling processes. Lastly, we propose an effective dimension as a measure of system complexity. A numerical example from cosmology is put forward to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Gauss Map: A jump into chaos with universal features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gauss map (or continued fraction map) is an important dissipative one-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behaviour and which generates a symbolic dynamics consisting of infinitely many different symbols. Here we introduce a generalization of the Gauss map which is given by $x_{t+1}=\frac{1}{x_t^\alpha} - \Bigl[\frac{1}{x_t^\alpha} \Bigr]$ where $\alpha \geq 0$ is a parameter and $x_t \in [0,1]$ ($t=0,1,2,3,\ldots$). The symbol $[\dots ]$ denotes the integer part. This map reduces to the ordinary Gauss map for $\alpha=1$. The system exhibits a sudden `jump into chaos' at the critical parameter value $\alpha=\alpha_c \equiv 0.241485141808811\dots$ which we analyse in detail in this paper. Several analytical and numerical results are established for this new map as a function of the parameter $\alpha$. In particular, we show that, at the critical point, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$ (i.e., the Cauchy distribution), which becomes infinitely narrow as $\alpha \to \alpha_c^+$. Moreover, in the chaotic region for large values of the parameter $\alpha$ we analytically derive approximate formulas for the invariant density, by solving the corresponding Perron-Frobenius equation. For $\alpha \to \infty$ the uniform density is approached. We provide arguments that some features of this transition scenario are universal and are relevant for other, more general systems as well.</description>

      <title>A critical state under weak measurement is not critical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical systems host nontrivial entanglement structure that is generally sensitive to additional couplings. In the present work, we study the effect of weak measurements on the entanglement Hamiltonian of massless free fermions which are prepared in their critical ground state. While the power-law decaying correlation and logarithmic growing entanglement entropy have been observed as typical signatures of quantum criticality after the weak measurement, in this work we show that the conformal symmetry is lost and the entanglement Hamiltonian generally becomes gapped for arbitrary small measurement strength. To reveal this unconventional entanglement structure, we consider a field-theory description that allows us to establish an analytic mapping between the entanglement Hamiltonians before and after the weak measurements. From this mapping, we find that although the measurements lead to a significant modification of the entanglement spectrum, the real-space distribution of the eigenfunction of the kernel of entanglement Hamiltonian is unchanged, which is responsible for the coexistence of a gapped entanglement Hamiltonian and the logarithmic entanglement entropy. Moreover, as the mapping works for arbitrarily many disjoint intervals, the multi-interval entanglement entropy also exhibits the same scaling behavior as the critical ground state, and shares the same effective central charge with the single-interval case. We numerically demonstrate these field-theory results on a lattice model, where the entanglement Hamiltonian after weak measurements exhibits the typical signature of a finite gap and becomes long-ranged even in the single-interval case. This is distinct from the critical ground state, where the entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval is gapless and local.</description>

      <title>Multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG) to compute the higher-order moment of physical quantities in a two-dimensional system. The replacement of the bond weight with an impurity matrix in a bond-weighted triad tensor network represents a physical quantity such as the magnetization and the energy. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the conventional tensor renormalization group for the Ising model and the 5-state Potts model. Furthermore, we perform the finite-size scaling analysis and observe that the dimensionless quantity characterizing the structure of the fixed point tensor satisfies the same scaling relation in the critical region as the Binder parameter. The estimated critical temperature dependence on the bond dimension indicates that the exponent relating the correlation length to the bond dimension varies continuously with respect to the BWTRG hyperparameter. We find that BWTRG with the optimal hyperparameter is more efficient in terms of computational time than alternative approaches based on the matrix product state in estimating the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the probability current in the stochastic path integral formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability current is a vital quantity in the Fokker-Planck description of stochastic processes. It characterizes nonequilibrium stationary states, appears in linear response calculation, and has been related to the entropy production and the heat flux. We recover and review the probability current in the Onsager-Machlup functional approach to Markov processes. We derive a self contained expression for the stationary probability current and the non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem using field theoretical methods. The derived formulas are explicitly evaluated in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of a harmonically bound particle in shear flow as exemplary analytic expressions. Our work closes a gap since it removes a missing link, i.e.~the probability current, in the supposed equivalence of the Fokker-Planck and the path-integral approach.</description>

      <title>Model-free learning of probability flows: Elucidating the nonequilibrium dynamics of flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active systems comprise a class of nonequilibrium dynamics in which individual components autonomously dissipate energy. Efforts towards understanding the role played by activity have centered on computation of the entropy production rate (EPR), which quantifies the breakdown of time reversal symmetry. A fundamental difficulty in this program is that high dimensionality of the phase space renders traditional computational techniques infeasible for estimating the EPR. Here, we overcome this challenge with a novel deep learning approach that estimates probability currents directly from stochastic system trajectories. We derive a new physical connection between the probability current and two local definitions of the EPR for inertial systems, which we apply to characterize the departure from equilibrium in a canonical model of flocking. Our results highlight that entropy is produced and consumed on the spatial interface of a flock as the interplay between alignment and fluctuation dynamically creates and annihilates order. By enabling the direct visualization of when and where a given system is out of equilibrium, we anticipate that our methodology will advance the understanding of a broad class of complex nonequilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ito-Langevin Process for Neutron Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an Ito-Langevin stochastic process that captures the time-dependent deviation from Poisson behavior of the noise detected from a general heterogeneous sub-critical neutron system. Using the probability generating function for the actual physical process, we deduce the super-Poisson deviation of the covariance matrix of counts at the detector due to neutron multiplication upon fission. This leads to a general form that coincides with the second moment of an Ito process. This comparison facilitates the formulation of a corresponding effective Langevin equation, which potentially enables simulations that significantly reduce the computational resources required compared to direct simulation of the system's actual noise. This method could assist in designing sub-critical noise experiments for licensing new research reactors, for improving cross-section libraries and for non-destructive assays of spent fuel.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics after quantum quenches as hydrodynamic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of fluctuations on large regions of space encodes universal properties of many-body systems. At equilibrium, it is described by thermodynamics. However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches, the fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact results have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of the physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles, taking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in one-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic arguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in particular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these principles, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the structure of hydrodynamic modes. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable models with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model for cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in fact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while long-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and non-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is expected to give all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Emergent disorder and sub-ballistic dynamics in quantum simulations of the Ising model using Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays with Van der Waals interactions provide a controllable path to simulate the locally connected transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), a prototypical model in statistical mechanics. Remotely operating the publicly accessible Aquila Rydberg atom array, we experimentally investigate the physics of TFIM far from equilibrium and uncover significant deviations from the theoretical predictions. Rather than the expected ballistic spread of correlations, the Rydberg simulator exhibits a sub-ballistic spread, along with a logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy in time - all while the system mostly retains its initial magnetization. By modeling the atom motion in tweezer traps, we trace these effects to an emergent natural disorder in Rydberg atom arrays, which we characterize with a minimal random spin model. We further experimentally explore the different dynamical regimes hosted in the system by varying the lattice spacing and the Rabi frequency. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atom motion in the many-body dynamics of Rydberg atom arrays at the TFIM limit, and propose simple benchmark measurements to test for its presence in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Certain BCS wavefunctions are quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method for constructing many-body scar states in fermionic lattice models that incorporate a given type of correlations with one of the states maximizing them over the full Hilbert space. Therefore this state may always be made the ground state by adding such correlations as a "pairing potential" $\delta H_0$ to any Hamiltonian $H=H_0+OT$ supporting group-invariant scars [arXiv:2007.00845]. In case of single-flavour spin-full fermions the ground state is a special case of the BCS wavefunction written in real space and invariant under any site index relabelling. For multi-orbital fermions this state also resembles BCS but includes higher order terms corresponding to "pairing" of more than two fermions. The broad class of eligible Hamiltonians $H$ is well documented [arXiv:2007.00845],[arXiv:2106.10300] and includes many conventional condensed matter interactions. The part of the Hamiltonian $(H_0+\delta H_0)$ that governs the exact dynamics of the scar subspace coincides with the BCS mean-field Hamiltonian. We therefore show that its BCS ground state and the excitations above it are many-body scars that are dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space and thereby protected from thermalization. These states are insensitive to a variety of $OT$ Hamiltonian terms that among others include interactions and (spin-orbit) hoppings. Our results point out a connection between the fields of superconductivity and weak ergodicity breaking (many-body scars) and will hopefully encourage further investigations. They also provide the first practical protocol to initialize a fermionic system to a scar state in (a quantum simulator) experiment.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth in the dark intervals of a locally monitored free-fermion chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its associated area law.</description>

      <title>The Gr\"uneisen parameter applied to critical phenomena and experimental investigations of correlated phenomena in molecular conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Ph.D. Thesis, a systematic review is performed on the derivation and generalization of the Gr\"uneisen parameter followed by its unprecedented applications to several distinct scenarios, such as magnetic model systems, zero-field quantum phase transitions, the maximization of caloric effects close to any critical-end point based on entropy arguments, the here-proposed adiabatic magnetization of a paramagnetic salt, as well as for Cosmology in the frame of the universe expansion. Since this Ph.D. Thesis is a symbiosis between theoretical and experimental results, an experimental investigation of correlated phenomena was carried out for molecular conductors of the (TMTTF)$_2$X family, where TMTTF is the base molecule tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and X a monovalent counter-anion such as PF$_6$, SbF$_6$, or AsF$_6$. Such strongly correlated electron systems are considered suitable ones for the exploration of Mott insulating phase, charge-ordering, spin-Peierls, and superconductivity. In particular, the investigation of a possible multiferroic character in these salts was performed via quasi-static (low-frequency) dielectric constant $\varepsilon'$ measurements as a function of temperature where a maximum in $\varepsilon'$ as a function of temperature was observed at the corresponding charge-ordering temperature for both hydrogenated and 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$SbF$_6$ salts. Furthermore, Raman measurements were performed on the 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, showing a possible magneto-optical effect on the $\nu_4(a_g)$ vibrational mode of the TMTTF molecule. Yet, fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the fully-hydrogenated (TMTTF)$_2$AsF$_6$ presents an expressive fluorescence background, which is roughly five orders of magnitude lower than that for the 97.5% deuterated variant of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of topological defects in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies point out far-reaching connections between the topological characteristics of structural glasses and their material properties, paralleling results in quantum physics that highlight the relevance of the nature of the wavefunction. However, the structural arrangement of the topological defects in glasses has so far remained elusive. Here we investigate numerically the geometry and statistical properties of the topological defects related to the vibrational eigenmodes of a prototypical three-dimensional glass. We find that at low-frequencies these defects form scale-invariant, quasi-linear structures and dictate the plastic events morphology when the system is subjected to a quasi-static shear, i.e., the eigenmode geometry shapes plastic behavior in 3D glasses. Our results indicate the existence of a deep link between the topology of eigenmodes and plastic energy dissipation in disordered materials, thus generalizing the known connection identified in crystalline materials. This link is expected to have consequences also for the relaxation dynamics in the liquid state, thus opening the door for a novel approach to describe this dynamics.</description>

      <title>Long-time analysis of a pair of on-lattice and continuous run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are characterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction reshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy conservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical models of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link between their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that as the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous RTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models converge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming configurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective attraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively explore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study is critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time. Because RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited to qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more accurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide deeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems, revealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.</description>

      <title>Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>

      <title>One Loop Thermal Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potentials in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating computation by harnessing the thermalization properties of physical systems. This work introduces a novel approach to solving quadratic programming problems using thermodynamic hardware. By incorporating a thermodynamic subroutine for solving linear systems into the interior-point method, we present a hybrid digital-analog algorithm that outperforms traditional digital algorithms in terms of speed. Notably, we achieve a polynomial asymptotic speedup compared to conventional digital approaches. Additionally, we simulate the algorithm for a support vector machine and predict substantial practical speedups with only minimal degradation in solution quality. Finally, we detail how our method can be applied to portfolio optimization and the simulation of nonlinear resistive networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I report the recent advances in applying (graded) Hopf algebras with braided tensor product in two scenarios: i) paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions living in any space dimensions and transforming under the permutation group; ii) physical models of anyons living in two space-dimensions and transforming under the braid group. In the first scenario simple toy models based on the so-called $2$-bit parastatistics show that, in the multiparticle sector, certain observables can discriminate paraparticles from ordinary bosons/fermions (thus, providing a counterexample to the widespread belief of the "conventionality of parastatistics" argument). In the second scenario the notion of (braided) Majorana qubit is introduced as the simplest building block to implement the Kitaev's proposal of a topological quantum computer which protects from decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Interplay of symmetry breaking and deconfinement in 3D quantum vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a broad class of frustration-free quantum vertex models in 3+1D whose ground states are weighted superpositions of classical 3D vertex model configurations. Our results are illustrated for diamond, cubic, and BCC lattices, but hold for general 3D lattices with even coordination number. The corresponding classical vertex models have a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge constraint enriched with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ global symmetry. We study the interplay between these symmetries by exploiting exact wavefunction dualities and effective field theories. We find an exact gapless point which by duality is related to the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point of $U(1)$ quantum spin liquids. At this point, both the symmetry breaking and deconfinement order parameters exhibit long range order. The gapless point is additionally a self-dual point of a second duality that maps the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ deconfined and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken phases to one another. For the BCC lattice vertex model, we find that gapless point is proximate to an unusual intermediate phase where symmetry breaking and deconfinement coexist.</description>

      <title>Chaotic turnover of rare and abundant species in a strongly interacting model community</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composition of ecological communities varies not only between different locations but also in time. Understanding the fundamental processes that drive species towards rarity or abundance is crucial to assessing ecosystem resilience and adaptation to changing environmental conditions. In plankton communities in particular, large temporal fluctuations in species abundances have been associated with chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, microbial diversity is overwhelmingly sustained by a `rare biosphere' of species with very low abundances. We consider here the possibility that interactions within a species-rich community can relate both phenomena. We use a Lotka-Volterra model with weak immigration and strong, disordered, and mostly competitive interactions between hundreds of species to bridge single-species temporal fluctuations and abundance distribution patterns. We highlight a generic chaotic regime where a few species at a time achieve dominance, but are continuously overturned by the invasion of formerly rare species. We derive a focal-species model that captures the intermittent boom-and-bust dynamics that every species undergoes. Although species cannot be treated as effectively uncorrelated in their abundances, the community's effect on a focal species can nonetheless be described by a time-correlated noise characterized by a few effective parameters that can be estimated from time series. The model predicts a non-unitary exponent of the power-law abundance decay, which varies weakly with ecological parameters, consistent with observation in marine protist communities. The chaotic turnover regime is thus poised to capture relevant ecological features of species-rich microbial communities.</description>

      <title>Dense Random Packing of Disks With a Power-Law Size Distribution in Thermodynamic Limit: Fractal-like Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation properties of a random system of densely packed disks, obeying a power-law size distribution, are analyzed in reciprocal space in the thermodynamic limit. This limit assumes that the total number of disks increases infinitely, while the mean density of the disk centers and the range of the size distribution are kept constant. We investigate the structure factor dependence on momentum transfer across various number of disks and extrapolate these findings to the thermodynamic limit. The fractal power-law decay of the structure factor is recovered in reciprocal space within the fractal range, which corresponds to the range of the size distribution in real space. The fractal exponent coincides with the exponent of the power-law size distribution as was shown previously by the authors [A. Yu. Cherny, E. M. Anitas, V. A. Osipov, J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044114 (2023)]. The dependence of the structure factor on density is examined. As is found, the power-law exponent remains unchanged but the fractal range shrinks when the packing fraction decreases. Additionally, the finite-size effects are studied at extremely low momenta of the order of the inverse system size. We show that the structure factor is parabolic in this region and calculate the prefactor analytically. The obtained results reveal fractal-like properties of the packing and can be used to analyze small-angle scattering from such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of Markovian open quantum systems can be described at the level of fluctuations by using continuous monitoring approaches. However, practical applications require assessing imperfect detection schemes, where the definition of main thermodynamic quantities becomes subtle and universal fluctuation relations are unknown. Here, we fill this gap by deriving a universal fluctuation relation that links thermodynamic entropy production and information-theoretical irreversibility along single trajectories in inefficient monitoring setups. This relation provides as a corollary an irreversibility estimator of dissipation using imperfect detection records that lower bounds the underlying entropy production at the level of visible trajectories. We illustrate our findings with a driven-dissipative two-level system following quantum jump trajectories and discuss the experimental applicability of our results for thermodynamic inference.</description>

      <title>Ductile and brittle yielding of athermal amorphous solids: a mean-field paradigm beyond the random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing a unified theory describing both ductile and brittle yielding constitutes a fundamental challenge of non-equilibrium statistical physics. Recently, it has been proposed that the nature of the yielding transition is controlled by physics akin to that of the quasistatically driven Random field Ising model (RFIM), which has served as the paradigm for understanding the effect of quenched disorder in slowly driven systems with short-ranged interactions. However, this theoretical picture neglects both the dynamics of, and the elasticity-induced long-ranged interactions between, the mesoscopic material constituents. Here, we address these two aspects and provide a unified theory building on the H\'ebraud-Lequeux elastoplastic description. The first aspect is crucial to understanding the competition between the imposed deformation rate and the finite timescale of plastic rearrangements: we provide a dynamical description of the macroscopic stress drop and predictions for the divergence of the peak susceptibility with inverse shear rate. The second is essential in order to capture properly the behaviour in the limit of quasistatic driving, where avalanches of plasticity diverge with system size at any value of the strain. We fully characterise the avalanche behaviour, which is radically different to that of the RFIM. In the quasistatic, infinite size limit, we find that both models have mean-field Landau exponents, obscuring the effect of the interactions. We show, however, that the latter profoundly affect the behaviour of finite systems approaching the spinodal-like brittle yield point, where we recover qualitatively the finite-size trends found in particle simulations, and modify the nature of the random critical point separating ductile and brittle yielding, where we predict critical behaviour on top of the marginality present at any value of the strain.</description>

Abstract: Spin glasses are quintessential examples of complex matter. Although much about their order remains uncertain, abstract models of them inform, e.g., the classification of combinatorial optimization problems, the magnetic ordering in metals with impurities, and artificial intelligence -- where they form a mathematical basis for neural network computing and brain modeling. We demonstrate the ability of an active quantum gas microscope to realize a spin glass of a novel driven-dissipative and vector form. By microscopically visualizing its glassy spin states, the technique allows us to directly measure replica symmetry breaking and the resulting ultrametric hierarchical structure. Ultrametricity is known to be emergent in models of evolution, protein folding, climate change, and infinite-range equilibrium spin glasses; this work shows it to be directly observable in a physically realized system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing allows for the manipulation of highly correlated states whose properties quickly go beyond the capacity of any classical method to calculate. Thus one natural problem which could lend itself to quantum advantage is the study of ground-states of condensed matter models, and the transitions between them. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in a simple, noise-robust manner which is agnostic to the method of ground state preparation. This work shows promising potential for near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, including avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Exact Hidden Markovian Dynamics in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a challenging frontier of physics. In this Letter, we systematically construct solvable nonintegrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact hidden Markovian subsystem dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show that the influence of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the subsystem with an ancilla of finite Hilbert space dimension. The realization of exact hidden Markovian property is facilitated by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear conductivity of aqueous electrolytes: beyond the first Wien effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conductivity of strong electrolytes increases under high electric fields, a nonlinear response known as the first Wien effect. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations we show that this increase is almost suppressed in moderately concentrated aqueous electrolytes due to the alignment of the water molecules by the electric field. As a consequence of this alignement, the permittivity of water decreases and becomes anisotropic, an effect which can be measured in simulations and reproduced by a model of water molecules as dipoles. We incorporate the resulting anisotropic interactions between the ions into a Stochastic Density Field Theory and calculate ionic correlations as well as corrections to the Nernst-Einstein conductivity, which are in qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Do deep neural networks behave like structural glasses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of self-similarity using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.</description>

      <title>[111]-strained spin ice: Localization of thermodynamically deconfined monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical spin ice under uniaxial strain along the $[111]$ crystallographic axis. Remarkably, such strain preserves the extensive ice degeneracy and the corresponding classical Coulomb phase. The emergent monopole excitations remain thermodynamically deconfined exactly as in the isotropic case. However, their motion under local heat bath dynamics depends qualitatively on the sign of the strain. In the low-temperature limit for negative strain, the monopoles diffuse, while for positive strain, they localize. Introducing additional ring exchange dynamics into the ice background transforms the localized monopoles into sub-dimensional excitations whose motion is restricted to diffusion in the $(111)$-plane. The phenomena we identify are experimentally accessible in rare-earth pyrochlores under uniaxial pressure as well as in tripod kagome materials. The diffusive versus localized nature of the monopoles manifests in characteristic magnetic noise spectra, which we compute.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder with a chirality-chirality interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder provides a minimal setup to explore an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant for understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp&lt;0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}&lt;0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Moreover, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.</description>

      <title>Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Universal time evolution of string order parameter in quantum critical systems with boundary invertible or non-invertible symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry, either invertible or non-invertible, has been extensively studied in two dimensional conformal field theories in recent years. When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however, many interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break such global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking boundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that the boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time evolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry operators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order parameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole system, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface breaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface symmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time after a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local quantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order parameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting statistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution of string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of these two different types of string order parameters in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift operators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection operators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the replica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the timeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the discreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the non-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the time evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability of having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole probability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Transport of molecules via polymerization in chemical gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of molecules for chemical reactions is critically important in various cellular biological processes. Despite thermal diffusion being prevalent in many biochemical processes, it is unreliable for any sort of directed transport or preferential accumulation of molecules. In this paper we propose a strategy for directed motion in which the molecules are transported by active carriers via polymerization. This transport is facilitated by chemical/activity gradients which generate an effective drift of the polymers. By marginalizing out the active degrees of freedom of the system, we obtain an effective Fokker-Planck equation for the Rouse modes of such active-passive hybrid polymers. In particular, we solve for the steady state distribution of the center of mass and its mean first passage time to reach an intended destination. We focus on how the arrangement of active units within the polymer affect its steady-state and dynamic behaviour and how they can be optimized to achieve high accumulation or rapid motility.</description>
