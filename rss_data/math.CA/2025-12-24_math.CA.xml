      <title>On Radial Distribution and Quasi-exact Solvability of Brioschi-Halphen Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brioschi-Halphen equation (BHE) is a second order complex differential equation obtained by a two step transformation of the Lam\'e equation. The Lam\'e equation is an equation in Astronomical physics used in the study of motion of planetary bodies. In this seminar, the radial part of the BHE for sufficiently large $r$ and the argument limit $2\pi$ is obtained. The asymptotic radial wave function associated with BHE is obtained in terms of canonical polynomials $\mathscr{P}_{n+1},$ and spherical function in $L^{2}(G,{\rm d}\mu), G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ using point canonical transformation and distributional solution in $\mathscr{C}_{c}^{\infty}(\Omega)$ using Fourier transform method are obtained.</description>

      <title>Spectra for finite unions of line segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the spectrality of arc-length measures supported on the union of two line segments in the plane. We show that any such spectral measure must admit a line spectrum. Moreover, when the two segments are non-parallel, such spectral measure admits only line spectra. Thus, in this case every spectrum is one dimensional. In addition we show that this property fails for unions of three or more segments in the plane. We construct some arc-length spectral measures supported on the union of at least three line segments such that none of its spectra is contained in a line. Finally, we work in the general framework of arc-length measures supported on finite unions of curves in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that the size of any orthogonal set for such a measure inside a ball of radius $R$ grows at most linearly in $R$. We also give an alternative proof of this bound, and in fact obtain a more general result of growth rate of orthogonal sets for Ahlfors--David regular measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (not restricted to the one-dimensional setting).</description>

      <title>Noetherianity and length of Melnikov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study foliations in $\mathbb{C}^2$ given by polynomial deformations of the form $dH+\epsilon \eta=0$, with $\gamma(t)\subset H^{-1}(t)$ a family of cycles. The \emph{Poincar\'e first return map} is of the form $P(t)=t+\sum_j \epsilon^j M_j^\gamma(t).$ The functions $M_j^\gamma$ are called \emph{Melnikov functions} and are given by \emph{iterated integrals of orbit length} at most $j$. We show that, for each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a \emph{universal Noetherianity index} $n_{\scriptscriptstyle H,\gamma}(k)$, independent of the deformation $\eta$, such that, if $M_j^\gamma\equiv0$, for $j=1,\ldots,n_{ H,\gamma}(k)$, then $M_j^\gamma$ is of orbit length $j-k$, for any Melnikov function $M_j^\gamma$. We call the smallest index with this property just the \emph{Noetherianity index} $\nu_{\scriptscriptstyle H,\gamma}(k)$. In order to prove this theorem, we develop a structure theorem for Melnikov functions and use the Ritt-Raudenbush differential algebra theorem. We calculate the universal Noetherianity index $n_{H,\gamma}(k)$ in various nontrivial examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics on Lie Groups: I. Noncommutative Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from square-integrable wave functions on a Lie group, we build an invertible Fourier transform mapping them on wave functions on the dual of the Lie algebra. This is a group-theoretic version of the map from position space to momentum space, with generally noncommuting momenta owing to the group structure. As a result, the multiplication of momentum-dependent functions involves star products, which makes the construction of noncommutative Fourier series much more involved than that of their commutative cousin. We show that our formalism provides an isometry of Hilbert spaces, and use it to derive a noncommutative Poisson summation formula for any compact Lie group. This is a key preliminary for the computation of Wigner functions and path integrals for quantum systems on group manifolds.</description>

Abstract: The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a survey of properties, values, identities, and generalizations of the Rogers--Ramanujan continued fraction, which is closely related to the Rogers--Ramanujan identities. Many of these results are found in Ramanujan's first two letters to Hardy, Ramanujan's notebooks, and his lost notebook.

      <title>Critical Hermitian matrix model with external source and Boussinesq hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random Hermitian matrix model of dimension $2n$, with external source, defined by the probability density function \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{Z_{2n}} \lvert \det(M) \rvert^{\alpha} e^{-2n\mathrm{Tr} (V(M) - AM)}, \quad V(x) = \frac{x^4}{4} - t\frac{x^2}{2}, \end{equation*} where the external source $A$ has two eigenvalues $\pm a$ of equal multiplicity. We investigate the limiting local statistics of the eigenvalues of $M$ around $0$ in certain critical regimes as $n \to \infty$. When the parameters $t$ and $a$ lie on a critical curve along which the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes as $|x|^{1/3}$, the double scaling limit of the correlation kernel is constructed from functions associated with the Boussinesq equation. This new limiting kernel reduces to the classical Pearcey kernel when $\alpha = 0$. Furthermore, in the multi-critical case where the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes as $|x|^{5/3}$, the limiting kernel is built from the second member of the Boussinesq hierarchy. We derive the results by transforming the random matrix model into biorthogonal ensembles that are analogous to the Muttalib-Borodin ensemble, and then analyzing its asymptotic behavior via a vector Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of weighted Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces with variable smoothness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study different types of weighted Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces with variable smoothness. The function spaces can be defined by means of the Littlewood-Paley theory in the field of Fourier analysis, while there are other norms arising in the theory of partial differential equations such as Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces. It is known that two norms are equivalent when one considers constant regularity function spaces without weights. We show that the equivalence still holds for variable smoothness and weights, which is accomplished by making use of shifted maximal functions, Peetre's maximal functions, and the reverse H\"older inequality. Moreover, we obtain a weighted regularity estimate for time-fractional evolution equations and a generalized Sobolev embedding theorem without weights.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and compactness of Bergman projection commutators in two-weight setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the boundedness and compactness of the Bergman projection commutators in two weighted settings via the weighted BMO and VMO spaces, respectively. The novelty of our work lies in the distinct treatment of the symbol b in the commutator, depending on whether it is analytic or not, which turns out to be quite different. In particular, we show that an additional weight condition due to Aleman, Pott, and Reguera is necessary to study the commutators when b is not analytic, while it can be relaxed when b is analytic. In the analytic setting, we completely characterize boundedness and compactness, while in the non-analytic setting, we provide a sufficient condition which generalizes the Euclidean case and is also necessary in many cases of interest. Our work initiates a study of the commutators acting on complex function spaces with different symbols.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for solutions of differential equations having a coalescing turning point and double pole, with an application to Legendre functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic behavior of solutions to the second-order linear differential equation $d^{2}w/dz^{2}=\{u^{2}f(\alpha,z)+g(z)\}w$ is analyzed for a large real parameter $u$ and $\alpha\in[0,\alpha_{0}]$, where $\alpha_{0}&gt;0$ is fixed. The independent variable $z$ ranges over a complex domain $Z$ (possibly unbounded) on which $f(\alpha,z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic except at $z=0$, where the differential equation has a regular singular point. For $\alpha&gt;0$, the function $f(\alpha,z)$ has a double pole at $z=0$ and a simple zero in $Z$, and as $\alpha\to 0$ the turning point coalesces with the pole. Bessel function approximations are constructed for large $u$ involving asymptotic expansions that are uniformly valid for $z\in Z$ and $\alpha\in[0,\alpha_{0}]$. The expansion coefficients are generated by simple recursions, and explicit error bounds are obtained that simplify earlier results. As an application, uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for associated Legendre functions of large degree $\nu$, valid for complex $z$ in an unbounded domain and for order $\mu\in[0,\nu(1-\delta)]$, where $\delta&gt;0$ is arbitrary.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part II. Fine connectedness properties of varifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For varifolds whose first variation is representable by integration, we introduce the notion of indecomposability with respect to locally Lipschitzian real valued functions. Unlike indecomposability, this weaker connectedness property is inherited by varifolds associated with solutions to geometric variational problems phrased in terms of sets, $G$ chains, and immersions; yet it is strong enough for the subsequent deduction of substantial geometric consequences therefrom. Our present study is based on several further concepts for varifolds put forward in this paper: real valued functions of generalised bounded variation thereon, partitions thereof in general, partition thereof along a real valued generalised weakly differentiable function in particular, and local finiteness of decompositions.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in new index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark breathers on an elliptic wave in the defocusing mKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.</description>
