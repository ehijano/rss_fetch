      <title>Topological communities in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most complex systems can be captured by graphs or networks. Networks connect nodes (e.g.\ neurons) through edges (synapses), thus summarizing the system's structure. A popular way of interrogating graphs is community detection, which uncovers sets of geometrically related nodes. {\em Geometric communities} consist of nodes ``closer'' to each other than to others in the graph. Some network features do not depend on node proximity -- rather, on them playing similar roles (e.g.\ building bridges) even if located far apart. These features can thus escape proximity-based analyses. We lack a general framework to uncover such features. We introduce {\em topological communities}, an alternative perspective to decomposing graphs. We find clusters that describe a network as much as classical communities, yet are missed by current techniques. In our framework, each graph guides our attention to its relevant features, whether geometric or topological. Our analysis complements existing ones, and could be a default method to study networks confronted without prior knowledge. Classical community detection has bolstered our understanding of biological, neural, or social systems; yet it is only half the story. Topological communities promise deep insights on a wealth of available data. We illustrate this for the global airport network, human connectomes, and others.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Katz and PageRank Centrality Measures in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of enforcing a desired centrality measure in complex networks, while still keeping the original pattern of the network. Specifically, by representing the network as a graph with suitable nodes and weighted edges, we focus on computing the smallest perturbation on the weights required to obtain a prescribed PageRank or Katz centrality index for the nodes. Our approach relies on optimization procedures that scale with the number of modified edges, enabling the exploration of different scenarios and altering network structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Citation Diversity in Scholarly Literature: An Entropy-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores global citation diversity,examining its various patterns across countries and academic disciplines.We analyzed citation distributions in top institutes worldwide,revealing that the higher citation end of the distribution follow Power law or Pareto law pattern and the Pareto law's scaling exponent changes with the number of institutes considered.An entropy based novel citation inequality measure has been introduced, enhancing the precision of our analysis. Our findings show that countries with small and large economies often group similarly based on citation diversity, with shifting the groupings as the number of institutes considered changes.Moreover,we analyzed citation diversity among award-winning scientists across six scientific disciplines,finding significant variations.We also explored the evolution of citation diversity over the past century across multiple fields.A gender-based study in various disciplines highlights citation inequalities among male and female scientists.Our innovative citation diversity measure stands out as a vital tool for evaluating citation inequality,providing insights beyond what traditional citation counts can offer.This thorough analysis deepens our understanding of global scientific contributions and promotes a more equitable view of academic accomplishments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of drug trafficking: Results from a simple compartmental model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a simple model for the emergence of drug dealers. For this purpose, we built a compartmental model considering four subpopulations, namely susceptibles, passive supporters, drug dealers and arrested drug dealers. The target is to study the influence of the passive supporters on the long-time prevalence of drug dealers. Passive supporters are people who are passively consenting to the drug trafficking cause. First we consider the model on a fully-connected newtork, in such a way that we can write a rate equation for each subpopulation. Our analytical and numerical results show that the emergence of drug dealers is a consequence of the rapid increase number of passive supporters. Such increase is associated with a nonequilibrium active-absorbing phase transition. After that, we consider the model on a two-dimensional square lattice, in order to compare the results in the presence of a simple social network with the previous results. The Monte Carlo simulation results suggest a similar behavior in comparison with the fully-connected network case, but the location of the critical point of the transition is distinct, due to the neighbors' correlations introduced by the presence of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Simple fusion-fission quantifies Israel-Palestine violence and suggests multi-adversary solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why humans fight has no easy answer. However, understanding better how humans fight could inform future interventions, hidden shifts and casualty risk. Fusion-fission describes the well-known grouping behavior of fish etc. fighting for survival in the face of strong opponents: they form clusters ('fusion') which provide collective benefits and a cluster scatters when it senses danger ('fission'). Here we show how similar clustering (fusion-fission) of human fighters provides a unified quantitative explanation for complex casualty patterns across decades of Israel-Palestine region violence, as well as the October 7 surprise attack -- and uncovers a hidden post-October 7 shift. State-of-the-art data shows this fighter fusion-fission in action. It also predicts future 'super-shock' attacks that will be more lethal than October 7 and will arrive earlier. It offers a multi-adversary solution. Our results -- which include testable formulae and a plug-and-play simulation -- enable concrete risk assessments of future casualties and policy-making grounded by fighter behavior.</description>

      <title>Language Understanding as a Constraint on Consensus Size in LLM Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) are going towards collaborative tasks where several agents interact with each other like in an LLM society. In such a setting, large groups of LLMs could reach consensus about arbitrary norms for which there is no information supporting one option over another, regulating their own behavior in a self-organized way. In human societies, the ability to reach consensus without institutions has a limit in the cognitive capacities of humans. To understand if a similar phenomenon characterizes also LLMs, we apply methods from complexity science and principles from behavioral sciences in a new approach of AI anthropology. We find that LLMs are able to reach consensus in groups and that the opinion dynamics of LLMs can be understood with a function parametrized by a majority force coefficient that determines whether consensus is possible. This majority force is stronger for models with higher language understanding capabilities and decreases for larger groups, leading to a critical group size beyond which, for a given LLM, consensus is unfeasible. This critical group size grows exponentially with the language understanding capabilities of models and for the most advanced models, it can reach an order of magnitude beyond the typical size of informal human groups.</description>

      <title>Power-grid modelling via gradual improvement of parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of electric power systems are widely studied through the phase synchronization of oscillators, typically with the use of the Kuramoto equation. While there are numerous well-known order parameters to characterize these dynamics, shortcoming of these metrics are also recognized. To capture all transitions from phase disordered states over phase locking to fully synchronized systems, new metrics were proposed and demonstrated on homogeneous models. In this paper we aim to address a gap in the literature, namely, to examine how gradual improvement of power grid models affect the goodness of certain metrics. To study how the details of models are perceived by the different metrics, 12 variations of a power grid model were created, introducing varying level of heterogeneity through the coupling strength, the nodal powers and the moment of inertia. The grid models were compared using a second-order Kuramoto equation and adaptive Runge-Kutta solver, measuring the values of the phase, the frequency and the universal order parameters. Finally, frequency results of the models were compared to grid measurements. We found that the universal order parameter was able to capture more details of the grid models, especially in cases of decreasing moment of inertia. The most heterogeneous models showed very low synchronization and thus suggest a limitation of the second-order Kuramoto equation. Finally, we show local frequency results related to the multi-peaks of static models, which implies that spatial heterogeneity can also induce such multi-peak behavior.</description>

      <title>Regulatory Functions from Cells to Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulatory functions are essential in both socioeconomic and biological systems, from corporate managers to regulatory genes in genomes. Regulatory functions come with substantial costs, but are often taken for granted. Here, we empirically examine regulatory costs across diverse systems -- biological organisms (bacteria and eukaryotic genomes), human organizations (companies, federal agencies, universities), and decentralized entities (Wikipedia, cities) -- using scaling analysis. We guide the empirical analysis with a conceptual model, which anticipates the scaling of regulatory costs to shift with the system's internal interaction structure -- well-mixed or modular. We find diverse systems exhibit consistent scaling patterns -- well-mixed systems exhibit superlinear scaling, while modular ones show sublinear or linear scaling. Further, we find that the socioeconomic systems containing more diverse occupational functions tend to have more regulatory costs than expected from their size, confirming the type of interactions also plays a role in regulatory costs. While many socioeconomic systems exhibit efficiencies of scale, regulatory costs in many social systems have grown disproportionally over time. Our finding suggests that the increasing complexity of functions may contribute to this trend. This cross-system comparison offers a framework for understanding regulatory costs and could guide future efforts to identify and mitigate regulatory inefficiencies.</description>

      <title>Growth, Poverty Trap and Escape</title>

Abstract: The well-known Solow growth model is the workhorse model of the theory of economic growth, which studies capital accumulation in a model economy as a function of time with capital stock, labour and technology-based production as the basic ingredients. The capital is assumed to be in the form of manufacturing equipment and materials. Two important parameters of the model are: the saving fraction $s$ of the output of a production function and the technology efficiency parameter $A$, appearing in the production function. The saved fraction of the output is fully invested in the generation of new capital and the rest is consumed. The capital stock also depreciates as a function of time due to the wearing out of old capital and the increase in the size of the labour population. We propose a stochastic Solow growth model assuming the saving fraction to be a sigmoidal function of the per capita capital $k_p$. We derive analytically the steady state probability distribution $P(k_p)$ and demonstrate the existence of a poverty trap, of central concern in development economics. In a parameter regime, $P(k_p)$ is bimodal with the twin peaks corresponding to states of poverty and well-being respectively. The associated potential landscape has two valleys with fluctuation-driven transitions between them. The mean exit times from the valleys are computed and one finds that the escape from a poverty trap is more favourable at higher values of $A$. We identify a critical value of $A_c$ below (above) which the state of poverty (well-being) dominates and propose two early signatures of the regime shift occurring at $A_c$. The economic model, with conceptual foundation in nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics, shares universal features with dynamical models from diverse disciplines like ecology and cell biology.</description>

      <title>Tensor product algorithms for inference of contact network from epidemiological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem of inferring contact network from nodal states observed during an epidemiological process. In a black--box Bayesian optimisation framework this problem reduces to a discrete likelihood optimisation over the set of possible networks. The cardinality of this set grows combinatorially with the number of network nodes, which makes this optimisation computationally challenging. For each network, its likelihood is the probability for the observed data to appear during the evolution of the epidemiological process on this network. This probability can be very small, particularly if the network is significantly different from the ground truth network, from which the observed data actually appear. A commonly used stochastic simulation algorithm struggles to recover rare events and hence to estimate small probabilities and likelihoods. In this paper we replace the stochastic simulation with solving the chemical master equation for the probabilities of all network states. Since this equation also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we apply tensor train approximations to overcome it and enable fast and accurate computations. Numerical simulations demonstrate efficient black--box Bayesian inference of the network.</description>
