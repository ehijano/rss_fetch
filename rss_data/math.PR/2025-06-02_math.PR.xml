      <title>Symmetrization for high dimensional dependent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a generic symmetrization property for dependent random variables $\{x_{t}\}_{t=1}^{n}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{p}$, where $p$ $&gt;&gt;$ $n$ is allowed. We link $\mathbb{E}\psi (\max_{1\leq i\leq p}|1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}(x_{i,t}$ $-$ $\mathbb{E}x_{i,t})|)$ to $\mathbb{E}\psi (\max_{1\leq i\leq p}|1/n$ $\sum_{t=1}^{n}\eta _{t}(x_{i,t}$ $-$ $\mathbb{E}% x_{i,t})|)$ for non-decreasing convex $\psi $ $:$ $[0,\infty )$ $\rightarrow $ $\mathbb{R}$, where $\{\eta _{t}\}_{t=1}^{n}$ are block-wise independent random variables, with a remainder term based on high dimensional Gaussian approximations that need not hold at a high level. Conventional usage of $% \eta _{t}(x_{i,t}$ $-$ $\tilde{x}_{i,t})$ with $\{\tilde{x}% _{i,t}\}_{t=1}^{n} $ an independent copy of $\{x_{i,t}\}_{t=1}^{n}$, and Rademacher $\eta _{t}$, is not required in a generic environment, although we may trivially replace $\mathbb{E}x_{i,t}$ with $\tilde{x}_{i,t}$. In the latter case with Rademacher $\eta _{t}$ our result reduces to classic symmetrization under independence. We bound and therefore verify the Gaussian approximations in mixing and physical dependence settings, thus bounding $\mathbb{E}\psi (\max_{1\leq i\leq p}|1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}(x_{i,t}$ $-$ $\mathbb{E}x_{i,t})|)$; and apply the main result to a generic % Nemirovski (2000)-like $\mathcal{L}_{q}$-maximal moment bound for $\mathbb{E}\max_{1\leq i\leq p}|1/n\sum_{t=1}^{n}(x_{i,t}$ $-$ $\mathbb{E}x_{i,t})|^{q}$, $q$ $\geq $ $1$.</description>

      <title>Markovian projections for functionals of It\^o semimartingales with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an It\^o semimartingale $X$, its Markovian projection is an It\^o semimartingale $\widehat{X}$, with Markovian differential characteristics, that matches the one-dimensional marginal laws of $X$. One may even require certain functionals of the two processes to have the same fixed-time marginals, at the cost of enhancing the differential characteristics of $\widehat{X}$ but still in a Markovian sense. In the continuous case, the definitive result on existence of Markovian projections was obtained by Brunick and Shreve~\cite{MR3098443}. In this paper, we extend their result to the fully general setting of It\^o semimartingales with jumps.</description>

      <title>On a Variation of Gambler's Ruin Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that letters (from a finite alphabet) in a text form a Markov chain. We track two distinct words, $U$ and $D$. A gambler gains 1 point for each occurrence of $U$ (including overlapping occurrences) and loses 1 point for each occurrence of $D$ (also including overlapping occurrences). We determine the probability of gaining $A$ points before losing $B$ points, where $A$ and $B$ are integers. Additionally, we find the expected waiting time until one of the two events -- gaining $A$ points or losing $B$ points -- occurs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Space Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity for every eligible particle at every vertex. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops at the moment when every vertex gets occupied by a single particle. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $d-$dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>On the rank of a random symmetric matrix in the large deviation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ random symmetric matrix with independent identically distributed subgaussian entries of unit variance. We prove the following large deviation inequality for the rank of $A$: for all $1\leq k\leq c\sqrt{n}$, $$\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Rank}(A)\geq n-k)\geq 1-\exp(-c'kn),$$ for some fixed constants $c,c'&gt;0$. A similar large deviation inequality is proven for the rank of the adjacency matrix of dense Erdos-Renyi graphs. This corank estimate enhances the recent breakthrough of Campos, Jensen, Michelen and Sahasrabudhe that the singularity probability of a random symmetric matrix is exponentially small, and echos a large deviation inequality of M.Rudelson for the rank of a random matrix with independent entries.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Conformal Flows in Even Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two stochastic analogs of a geometric flow on even-dimensional manifolds called $Q$-curvature flow, and use the theory of Dirichlet forms to construct weak solutions to both. The first of these flows, which we call the normalized $Q$ flow (NQF), preserves the intrinsic volume normalization from the deterministic setting. The second, which we call the Liouville $Q$ flow (LQF), has a different normalization motivated by a similar flow studied in arXiv:1904.10909. The volume dynamics of NQF and LQF are shown to evolve as square Bessel and CIR processes, respectively. We also show that under certain additional conditions, LQF is a stochastic quantization of the even-dimensional Polyakov-Liouville measures recently defined in arXiv:2105.13925.</description>

      <title>$W$-entropy formulas and Langevin deformation on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Perelman's seminal work on the $W$-entropy formula for the Ricci flow and related works, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and rigidity theorem for the geodesic flow on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over a complete Riemannian manifold with bounded geometry condition. Then we introduce the Langevin deformation on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over a complete Riemannian manifold, which interpolates between the $p$-Laplacian heat equation and the geodesic flow on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space, ${1\over p}+{1\over q}=1$, $1&lt; p, q&lt;\infty$. The Langevin deformation is essentially related to the compressible $p$-Euler equation with damping and has physical background in non-Newtonian fluid mechanics. The local existence, uniqueness and regularity of the Langevin deformation are proved for $q\in [2, \infty)$. We further prove the $W$-entropy-information formula and the rigidity theorem for the Langevin deformation on the $L^q$-Wasserstein space over an $n$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature, where $q\in (1,\infty)$. Our results extend the previous ones obtained by S. Li and the second named author for $p=q=2$, and improve a convexity result due to Lott based on the work by Lott and Villani. Finally, we extend our results to weighted Riemannian manifolds with CD$(0, m)$-condition.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic of Coulomb gas integral, Temperley-Lieb type algebras and pure partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the asymptotic behavior of several types of Coulomb gas integrals and construct the pure partition functions for multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ and general multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems.
  For both radial and chordal cases, we prove the linear independence of the ground state solutions $J_{\alpha}^{(m,n)}(\boldsymbol{x})$ to the null vector equations for irrational values of $\kappa \in (0,8)$.
  In particular, we show that the ground state solutions $J^{(m,n)}_\alpha \in B_{m,n}$, indexed by link patterns $\alpha$ with $m$ screening charges, are linearly independent when $\kappa$ is irrational. This is achieved by constructing, for each link pattern $\beta$, a dual functional $l_\beta \in B^{*}_{m,n}$ such that the meander matrix of the corresponding Temperley-Lieb type algebra is given by $M_{\alpha\beta} = l_{\beta}(J^{(m,n)}_\alpha)$. The determinant of this matrix admits an explicit expression and is nonzero for irrational $\kappa$, establishing the desired linear independence.
  As a consequence, we construct the pure partition functions $Z_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{x})$ of the multiple $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems for each link pattern $\alpha$ by multiplying the inverse of the meander matrix.
  This method can also be extended to the asymptotic analysis of the excited state solutions $\mathcal{K}_{\alpha}$ in both radial and chordal cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quenched and annealed large deviations of the random walk in random environment are shown to conform on any compact set whenever the level of disorder is sufficiently low. In this work, we show that these two large deviations always disagree at some interior point of the natural domain of the random walk in strongly mixing environment, regardless of the level of disorder.</description>

      <title>Percolation on random 2-lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, we consider a model for a random cover of $G$ by taking two parallel copies of $G$ and crossing every pair of parallel edges randomly with probability $q$ independently of each other. The resulting graph $G_q$, is a random $2$-lift of $G$ that may not be transitive but still probabilistically exhibit many properties of transitive graphs. Studying percolation in this context can help us test the reliability and robustness of our proofs methods in percolation theory. Our three main results on this model are the continuity of the critical parameter $p_c(G_q)$, for $q\in(0,1)$, the strict monotonicity $p_c(G_q)&lt; p_c(G)$ and the exponential decay of the cluster size in the subcritical regime at $q=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition and well-posedness of Cauchy problem for Fokker-Planck equations with unbounded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the partial differential operator $L$ with low regularity condition. To address uniqueness, we apply a recently developed superposition principle for unbounded coefficients, which reduces the uniqueness problem for the Fokker-Planck equation to the uniqueness of solutions to the martingale problem. Using the Cholesky decomposition algorithm, a standard tool in numerical linear algebra, we construct a lower triangular matrix of functions $\sigma$ with suitable regularity such that $A = \sigma \sigma^T$. This formulation allows us to connect the uniqueness of solutions to the martingale problem with the uniqueness of weak solutions to It\^{o}-SDEs. For existence, we rely on established results concerning sub-Markovian semigroups, which enable us to confirm the existence of solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation under general growth conditions expressed as inequalities. Additionally, by imposing further growth conditions on the coefficients, also expressed as inequalities, we establish the ergodicity of the solutions. This work demonstrates the interplay between stochastic analysis and numerical linear algebra in addressing problems related to partial differential equations.</description>

We then prove a uniqueness theorem ``\`a la Trushkin'' in one dimension for strongly unimodal distributions and divergences gerated by strictly convex functions whiose thire dervative is either stictly $\log$-convex or $\log$-concave.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of the empirical distribution associated with a system of interacting kinetic particles subject to independent Brownian forcing in a finite horizon setting, using some recent progress on kinetic non-linear partial differential equations. Under general assumptions that require only weak convergence on the initial datum -without assuming independence or moment conditions- we prove convergence in probability to the corresponding non-linear Fokker-Planck PDE.</description>

      <title>Branch lengths for geodesics in the directed landscape and mutation patterns in growing spatially structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a population that is expanding in two-dimensional space. Suppose we collect data from a sample of individuals taken at random either from the entire population, or from near the outer boundary of the population. A quantity of interest in population genetics is the site frequency spectrum, which is the number of mutations that appear on $k$ of the $n$ sampled individuals, for $k = 1, \dots, n-1$. As long as the mutation rate is constant, this number will be roughly proportional to the total length of all branches in the genealogical tree that are on the ancestral line of $k$ sampled individuals. While the rigorous literature has primarily focused on models without any spatial structure, in many natural settings, such as tumors or bacteria colonies, growth is dictated by spatial constraints. A large number of such two dimensional growth models are expected to fall in the KPZ universality class exhibiting similar features as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.
  In this article we adopt the perspective that for population models in the KPZ universality class, the genealogical tree can be approximated by the tree formed by the infinite upward geodesics in the directed landscape, a universal scaling limit constructed in \cite{dov22}, starting from $n$ randomly chosen points. Relying on geodesic coalescence, we prove new asymptotic results for the lengths of the portions of these geodesics that are ancestral to $k$ of the $n$ sampled points and consequently obtain exponents driving the site frequency spectrum as predicted in \cite{fgkah16}. An important ingredient in the proof is a new tight estimate of the probability that three infinite upward geodesics stay disjoint up to time $t$, i.e., a sharp quantitative version of the well studied N3G problem, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Free Askey--Wilson functionals and geometric last passage percolation on a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barraquand, Corwin, and Yang arXiv:2306.05983 established that geometric last passage percolation (LPP) on a strip of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ has a unique stationary measure. Building on this, Barraquand arXiv:2409.08927 derived explicit contour integral formulas for the model's multipoint probability generating function. In this paper, we introduce free Askey--Wilson functionals and use them to extend these generating function formulas. Our framework yields explicit expressions valid over a broader range of boundary parameters than previously accessible. This generalization allows us to determine the full phase diagram that characterizes how the large-scale asymptotics of the stationary measure depend on the boundary conditions. In addition, we prove a Poisson approximation for the stationary measure when the parameters vary with the strip width.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Monty Hall Problem Through a Quantum Measurement Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle known for its counterintuitive solution, revealing fundamental discrepancies between mathematical reasoning and human intuition. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel explanatory framework inspired by quantum measurement theory. Specifically, we conceptualize the hosts' actions-opening doors to reveal non-prizes-as analogous to quantum measurements that cause asymmetric collapses of the probability distribution. This quantum-inspired interpretation not only clarifies why the intuitive misunderstanding arises but also provides generalized formulas consistent with standard Bayesian results. We further validate our analytical approach using Monte Carlo simulations across various problem settings, demonstrating precise agreement between theoretical predictions and empirical outcomes. Our quantum analogy thus offers a powerful pedagogical tool, enhancing intuitive understanding of conditional probability phenomena through the lens of probability redistribution and quantum-like measurement operations.</description>

      <title>Learning Spatio-Temporal Vessel Behavior using AIS Trajectory Data and Markovian Models in the Gulf of St. Lawrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maritime Mobility is at the center of the global economy, and analyzing and understanding such data at scale is critical for ocean conservation and governance. Accordingly, this work introduces a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to analyze vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, emphasizing changes induced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the ocean space into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for individual vessel types using the frequency of cell transitions and the dwell time within each cell. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize vessel dynamics at different temporal resolutions. Under multiple vessel types, we contribute with a temporal evolution analysis of mobility patterns during pandemic times, highlighting significant but transient changes to recurring transportation behaviors. Our findings indicate vessel-specific mobility signatures consistent across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting that those are latent behavioral invariants. Besides, we observe significant temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, indicating a strong influence of social isolation policies and operational limitations imposed on non-essential maritime activity in this region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kalman(-Bucy) filter is the natural choice for the state reconstruction of disturbed, linear dynamical systems based on flawed and incomplete measurements. Taking a deterministic viewpoint this work investigates possible extensions of the concept to systems with uncertain dynamics and noise covariances. In a theoretical analysis error bounds in terms of the variance of the uncertainties are derived. The article concludes with a numerical implementation of two example systems allowing for a comparison of the estimators.</description>

      <title>Estimating Unobservable States in Stochastic Epidemic Models with Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates stochastic epidemic models with partial information and addresses the estimation of current values of not directly observable states. The latter is also called nowcasting and related to the so-called "dark figure" problem, which concerns, for example, the estimation of unknown numbers of asymptomatic and undetected infections. The study is based on Ouabo Kamkumo et al. (2025), which provides detailed information about stochastic multi-compartment epidemic models with partial information and various examples. Starting point is a description of the state dynamics by a system of nonlinear stochastic recursions resulting from a time-discretization of a diffusion approximation of the underlying counting processes. The state vector is decomposed into an observable and an unobservable component. The latter is estimated from the observations using the extended Kalman filter approach in order to take into account the nonlinearity of the state dynamics. Numerical simulations for a Covid-19 model with partial information are presented to verify the performance and accuracy of the estimation method.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Random Time Horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared to traditional approaches.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces the first in-depth study of h-free and h-full elements in abelian monoids, providing a unified approach for understanding their role in various mathematical structures. Let m be an element of an abelian monoid, with {\omega}(m) denoting the number of distinct prime elements generating m. We study the moments of {\omega}(m) over subsets of h-free and h-full elements, establishing the normal order of {\omega}(m) within these subsets. Our findings are then applied to number fields, global function fields, and geometrically irreducible projective varieties, demonstrating the broad relevance of this approach.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of Mean Field Games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Clustering in Mixture of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent, high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains -- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering error with high probability, under the conditions $H = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique structure of this clustering problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any $k\geq3$ for clause/variable ratios up to the Gibbs uniqueness threshold of the corresponding Galton-Watson tree, the number of satisfying assignments of random $k$-SAT formulas is given by the `replica symmetric solution' predicted by physics methods [Monasson, Zecchina: Phys. Rev. Lett. (1996)]. Furthermore, while the Gibbs uniqueness threshold is still not known precisely for any $k\geq3$, we derive new lower bounds on this threshold that improve over prior work [Montanari and Shah: SODA (2007)].The improvement is significant particularly for small $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The signature of a path is a non-commutative power series whose coefficients are given by certain iterated integrals over the path coordinates. This series almost uniquely characterizes the path up to translation and reparameterization. Taking only fixed degree parts of these series yields signature tensors. We introduce the Macaulay2 package $\texttt{PathSignatures}$ to simplify the study of these interesting objects for piecewise polynomial paths. It allows for the creation and manipulation of parametrized families of paths and provides methods for computing their signature tensors and their associated algebraic varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular method for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian inference and probabilistic machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for quantifying the statistical accuracy of mean-field variational inference (MFVI) for posterior approximation in Bayesian latent variable models with categorical local latent variables. Utilizing our general framework, we capture the exact asymptotic regime where MFVI `works' for the celebrated latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Focusing on the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB), we show that the vanilla fully factorized MFVI, often used in the literature, is suboptimal. We propose a partially grouped VI algorithm for this model and show that it works, and derive its exact asymptotic performance. We further illustrate that our bounds are tight for both the above models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the bicausal optimal transport problem between the laws of scalar time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations, and we establish the optimality of the synchronous coupling between these laws. The proof of this result is based on time-discretisation and reveals a novel connection between the synchronous coupling and the celebrated discrete-time Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement. We also prove a result on equality of topologies restricted to a certain subset of laws of continuous-time processes. We complement our main results with examples showing how the optimal coupling may change in path-dependent and multidimensional settings.</description>

      <title>On the limit theory of mean field optimal stopping with non-Markov dynamics and common noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a mean-field optimal stopping problem with non-Markov dynamics and common noise, inspired by Talbi, Touzi, and Zhang \cite{TalbiTouziZhang1,TalbiTouziZhang3}. The goal is to establish the limit theory and demonstrate the equivalence of the value functions between weak and strong formulations. The difference between the strong and weak formulations lies in the source of randomness determining the stopping time on a canonical space. In the strong formulation, the randomness of the stopping time originates from Brownian motions. In contrast, this may not necessarily be the case in the weak formulation. Additionally, a $(H)$-Hypothesis-type condition is introduced to guarantee the equivalence of the value functions. The limit theory encompasses the convergence of the value functions and solutions of the large population optimal stopping problem towards those of the mean-field limit, and it shows that every solution of the mean field optimal stopping problem can be approximated by solutions of the large population optimal stopping problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Alain-Sol Sznitman's interlacement process, we consider the set of $\{0,1\}$-valued processes which can be constructed in an analogous way, namely as a union of sets coming from a Poisson process on a collection of sets. Our main focus is to determine which processes are representable in this way. Some of our results are as follows. (1) All positively associated Markov chains and a large class of renewal processes are so representable. (2) Whether an average of two product measures, with close densities, on $n$ variables, is representable is related to the zeroes of the polylogarithm functions. (3) Using (2), we show that a number of tree-indexed Markov chains as well as the Ising model on $ \mathbb{Z}^d ,$ $d\geq 2,$ for certain parameters are not so representable. (4) The collection of permutation invariant processes that are representable corresponds exactly to the set of infinitely divisible random variables on $[0,\infty]$ via a certain transformation. (5) The supercritical (low temperature) Curie-Weiss model is not representable for large~$n$.</description>

Abstract: We address a system of weakly interacting particles where the heterogenous connections among the particles are described by a graph sequence and the number of particles grows to infinity. Our results extend the existing law of large numbers and propagation of chaos results to the case where the interaction between one particle and its neighbors is expressed as a nonlinear function of the local empirical measure. In the limit of the number of particles which tends to infinity, if the graph sequence converges to a graphon, then we show that the limit system is described by an infinite collection of processes and can be seen as a process in a suitable $L^2$ space constructed via a Fubini extension. The proof is built on decoupling techniques and careful estimates of the Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limit of the Kuramoto Model on Random Geometric Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kuramoto model on a graph with nodes given by $n$ i.i.d. points uniformly distributed on the $d$ dimensional torus. Two nodes are declared neighbors if they are at distance less than $\epsilon$. We prove a scaling limit for this model in compact time intervals as $n\to\infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$ such that $\epsilon^{d+2}n/\log n \to \infty$. The limiting object is given by the heat equation. On the one hand this shows that the nonlinearity given by the sine function disappears under this scaling and on the other hand, provides evidence that stable equilibria of the Kuramoto model on these graphs are, as $n\to\infty$, in correspondence with those of the heat equation, which are explicit and given by twisted states. In view of this, we conjecture the existence of twisted stable equilibria with high probability as $n\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>On the number of elements beyond the ones actually observed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a variant of the birth and death chain with constant intensities, originally introduced by
  Bruno de Finetti way back in 1957, is revisited. This fact is also underlined by the choice of the title,
  which is clearly a literal translation of the original one. Characteristic of the variant is that it
  allows negative jumps of any magnitude. And this, as explained in the paper, might be useful in offering
  some insight into the issue, arising in numerous situations, of inferring the number of the undetected
  elements of a given population. One thinks, for example, of problems concerning abundance or richness of
  species.
  The author's purpose is twofold: to align the original de Finetti's construction with the modern,
  well-established theory of the continuous-time Markov chains with discrete state space and show how it
  could be used to make probabilistic previsions on the number of the unseen elements of a population.
  With the aim of enhancing the possible practical applications of the model, one discusses the statistical
  point estimation of the rates which characterize its infinitesimal description.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of product systems of Hilbert spaces derived from Banach space-valued L\'evy processes. We establish conditions under which these product systems are completely spatial and show that Gaussian L\'evy processes with non-degenerate covariance always give rise to product systems of type I. Furthermore, we construct a continuum of non-isomorphic product systems of type \(\rm{II}\sb\infty\) from pure jump L\'evy processes.</description>

Abstract: Consider $d+2$ i.i.d. random points $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ in $\mathbb R^d$. In this note, we compute the probability that their convex hull is a simplex focusing on three specific distributional settings: (i) the distribution of $X_1$ is multivariate standard normal; (ii) the density of $X_1$ is proportional to $(1-\|x\|^2)^{\beta}$ on the unit ball (the beta distribution); (iii) the density of $X_1$ is proportional to $(1+\|x\|^2)^{-\beta}$ (the beta prime distribution). In the Gaussian case, we show that this probability equals twice the sum of the solid angles of a regular $(d+1)$-dimensional simplex.</description>

Abstract: The gambler's ruin problem for correlated random walks (CRW), both with and without delays, is addressed using the Optional Stopping Theorem for martingales. We derive closed-form expressions for the ruin probabilities and the expected game duration for CRW with increments $\{1,-1\}$ and for symmetric CRW with increments $\{1,0,-1\}$ (CRW with delays). Additionally, a martingale technique is developed for general CRW with delays. The gambler's ruin probability for a game involving bets on two arbitrary patterns is also examined.</description>

      <title>Anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations and their applications to nonzero-sum stochastic differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [J. Wen, Y. Shi, Stat. Probab. Lett. 156 (2020) 108599] the authors first introduced a kind of anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (anticipated BSVIEs, for short). By virtue of the duality principle, it is found in this paper that the anticipated BSVIEs can be applied to the study of stochastic differential games. For this, in this paper we deeply investigate a more general class of anticipated BSVIEs whose generator includes both pointwise time-advanced functions and average time-advanced functions. In theory, the well-posedness and the comparison theorem of anticipated BSVIEs are established, and some regularity results of adapted M-solutions are proved by applying Malliavin calculus, which cover the previous results for BSVIEs. Further, using linear ABSVIEs as the adjoint equation, we present the maximum principle for the nonzero-sum differential game system of stochastic delay Volterra integral equations (SDVIEs, for short) for the first time. As one of the applications of the principle, a Nash equilibrium point of the linear-quadratic differential game problem of SDVIEs is obtained.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of SLE(0+) variants in the capacity parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove large deviation principles (LDPs) for full chordal, radial, and multichordal SLE(0+) curves parameterized by capacity. The rate function is given by the appropriate variant of the Loewner energy. There are two key novelties in the present work. First, we strengthen the topology in the known chordal LDPs into the topology of full parameterized curves including all curve endpoints. We also obtain LDPs in the space of unparameterized curves. Second, we address the radial case, which requires in part different methods from the chordal case, due to the different topological setup. We establish our main results via proving an exponential tightness property and combining it with detailed curve return probability estimates, in the spirit of exponentially good approximations in LDP theory. In the radial case, additional work is required to refine the estimates appearing in the literature. Notably, since we manage to prove a finite-time LDP in a better topology than in earlier literature, return energy estimates follow as a consequence of the return probability estimates.</description>

      <title>Invariance of three-dimensional Bessel bridges in terms of time reversal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $a,b\ge 0$ and $t&gt;0$, let $\rho =\{ \rho _{s}\} _{0\le s\le t}$ be a three-dimensional Bessel bridge from $a$ to $b$ over $[0,t]$. In this paper, based on a conditional identity in law between Brownian bridges stemming from Pitman's theorem, we show in particular that the process given by \begin{align*}
  \rho _{s}+\Bigl| b-a+
  \min _{0\le u\le s}\rho _{u}-\min _{s\le u\le t}\rho _{u}
  \Bigr|
  -\Bigl|
  \min _{0\le u\le s}\rho _{u}-\min _{s\le u\le t}\rho _{u}
  \Bigr| ,\quad 0\le s\le t, \end{align*} has the same law as the time reversal $\{ \rho _{t-s}\} _{0\le s\le t}$ of $\rho $. As an immediate application, letting $R=\{ R_{s}\} _{s\ge 0}$ be a three-dimensional Bessel process starting from $a$, we obtain the following time-reversal and time-inversion results on $R$: $\{ R_{t-s}\} _{0\le s\le t}$ is identical in law with the process given by \begin{align*}
  R_{s}+R_{t}-2\min _{s\le u\le t}R_{u},\quad 0\le s\le t, \end{align*} when $a=0$, and $\{ sR_{1/s}\} _{s&gt;0}$ is identical in law with the process given by \begin{align*}
  R_{s}-2(1+s)\min _{0\le u\le s}\frac{R_{u}}{1+u}+a(1+s),\quad s&gt;0, \end{align*} for every $a\ge 0$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Stochastic Particle System to the Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a system of integro-differential equations describing the evolution of cluster mass under mass exchange. The rate of exchange depends on the masses of the clusters involved and the mass being exchanged. This can be viewed as both a continuous generalization of the exchange-driven growth model and a coagulation-fragmentation equation that generalizes the continuous Smoluchowski equation.
  Starting from a Markov jump process that describes a finite stochastic interacting particle system with exchange dynamics, we prove the weak law of large numbers for this process for sublinearly growing kernels in the mean-field limit. We establish the tightness of the stochastic process on a measure-valued Skorokhod space induced by the $1$-Wasserstein metric, from which we deduce the existence of solutions to the (CGEDG) system. The solution is shown to have a Lebesgue density under suitable assumptions on the initial data. Moreover, within the class of solutions with density, we establish the uniqueness under slightly more restrictive conditions on the kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first $\alpha$-parameterized framework for solving time-changed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), explicitly linking convergence rates and key driving parameter of the underlying stochastic processes. Theoretically, we derive exact moment estimates and exponential moment estimate of inverse $\alpha$-stable subordinator $E$ using Mittag-Leffler functions. The stochastic theta (ST) method is investigated for a class of SDEs driven by a time-changed Brownian motion, whose coefficients are time-space-dependent and satisfy the local Lipschitz condition. We prove that the convergence order dynamically responds to the stability index $\alpha$ of stable subordinator $D$, filling a critical gap in traditional methods that treat these factors independently. We also investigate the criteria of asympotical mean square stability of the ST method. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong relative arbitrage problem in Stochastic Portfolio Theory seeks an investment strategy that almost surely outperforms a benchmark portfolio at the end of a given time horizon. The highest relative return in relative arbitrage opportunities is characterized by the smallest nonnegative continuous solution of a Cauchy problem for a partial differential equation (PDE). However, solving this type of PDE poses analytical and numerical challenges, due to the high dimensionality and its non-unique solutions. In this paper, we discuss numerical methods to address the relative arbitrage problem and the associated PDE in a volatility-stabilized market, using time-changed Bessel bridges. We present a practical algorithm and demonstrate numerical results through an example in volatility-stabilized markets.</description>

      <title>Homophily Within and Across Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homophily-the tendency to connect with similar others-plays a central role in shaping network structure and function. It is often treated as a uniform, global parameter, independent from other structural features. Here, we propose a maximum-entropy framework that decomposes homophily into contributions within and across groups, with the stochastic block model emerging as a special case. Our exponential-family formulation, parameterized by group size, fits real-world social networks well and allows homophily to be captured with a single parameter per group size. This decomposition shows that aggregate metrics often obscure group-level variation. We also find that the scale-dependent distribution of homophily has a significant impact on network percolation, influencing epidemic thresholds, the spread of ideas or behaviors, and the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Ignoring this heterogeneity can lead to distorted conclusions about connectivity and dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Decay of correlation for edge colorings when $q&gt;3\Delta$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine various perspectives on the decay of correlation for the uniform distribution over proper $q$-edge colorings of graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$.
  First, we establish the coupling independence property when $q\ge 3\Delta$ for general graphs. Together with the work of Chen et al. (2024), this result implies a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for counting the number of proper $q$-edge colorings.
  Next, we prove the strong spatial mixing property on trees, provided that $q&gt; (3+o(1))\Delta$. The strong spatial mixing property is derived from the spectral independence property of a version of the weighted edge coloring distribution, which is established using the matrix trickle-down method developed in Abdolazimi, Liu and Oveis Gharan (FOCS, 2021) and Wang, Zhang and Zhang (STOC, 2024).
  Finally, we show that the weak spatial mixing property holds on trees with maximum degree $\Delta$ if and only if $q\ge 2\Delta-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies quantitative homogenization of elliptic equations with random, uniformly elliptic coefficients that vanish in a union of random holes. Assuming an upper bound on the size of the holes and a separation condition between them, we derive optimal bounds for the regularity radius $r_*$ and suboptimal growth estimates for the corrector. These results are key ingredients for error analysis in stochastic homogenization and serve as crucial input for recent developments in the double-porosity model, such as those by Bonhomme, Duerinckx, and Gloria (arXiv:2502.02847).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study coupled KPZ equations with three control parameters $X,Y,T$. These equations are used in the context of stretched polymers in a random medium, for the spacetime spin-spin correlator of the isotropic quantum Heisenberg chain, and for exciton-polariton condensates. In an earlier article we investigated merely the diagonal $X=Y$, $T=1$. Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent is obtained numerically to be close to $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Graphon Mean Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in graphon mean field games and their applications, this paper provides a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of graphon mean field control (GMFC) problems, where the controlled dynamics are governed by a graphon mean field stochastic differential equation with heterogeneous mean field interactions. We formulate the GMFC problem with general graphon mean field dependence and establish the existence and uniqueness of the associated graphon mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We then derive a version of the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle tailored to GMFC problems. Furthermore, we analyze the solvability of the GMFC problem for linear dynamics and study the continuity and stability of the graphon mean field FBSDEs under the optimal control profile. Finally, we show that the solution to the GMFC problem provides an approximately optimal solution for large systems with heterogeneous mean field interactions, based on a propagation of chaos result.</description>
