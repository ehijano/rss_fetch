      <title>Upper tails for arithmetic progressions revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be the number of $k$-term arithmetic progressions contained in the $p$-biased random subset of the first $N$ positive integers. We give asymptotically sharp estimates on the logarithmic upper-tail probability $\log \Pr(X \ge E[X] + t)$ for all $\Omega(N^{-2/k}) \le p \ll 1$ and all $t \gg \sqrt{Var(X)}$, excluding only a few boundary cases. In particular, we show that the space of parameters $(p,t)$ is partitioned into three phenomenologically distinct regions, where the upper-tail probabilities either resemble those of Gaussian or Poisson random variables, or are naturally described by the probability of appearance of a small set that contains nearly all of the excess $t$ progressions. We employ a variety of tools from probability theory, including classical tilting arguments and martingale concentration inequalities. However, the main technical innovation is a combinatorial result that establishes a stronger version of `entropic stability' for sets with rich arithmetic structure.</description>

      <title>Random walks with stochastic resetting in complex networks: a discrete time approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time Markovian random walk with resets on a connected undirected network. The resets, in which the walker is relocated to randomly chosen nodes, are governed by an independent discrete-time renewal process. Some nodes of the network are target nodes, and we focus on the statistics of first hitting of these nodes. In the non-Markov case of the renewal process, we consider both light- and fat-tailed inter-reset distributions. We derive the propagator matrix in terms of discrete backward recurrence time PDFs and in the light-tailed case we show the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state. In order to tackle the non-Markov scenario, we derive a defective propagator matrix which describes an auxiliary walk characterized by killing the walker as soon as it hits target nodes. This propagator provides the information on the mean first passage statistics to the target nodes. We establish sufficient conditions for ergodicity of the walk under resetting. Furthermore, we discuss a generic resetting mechanism for which the walk is non-ergodic. Finally, we analyze inter-reset time distributions with infinite mean where we focus on the Sibuya case. We apply these results to study the mean first passage times for Markovian and non-Markovian (Sibuya) renewal resetting protocols in realizations of Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'asi-Albert random graphs. We show non trivial behavior of the dependence of the mean first passage time on the proportions of the relocation nodes, target nodes and of the resetting rates. It turns out that, in the large-world case of the Watts-Strogatz graph, the efficiency of a random searcher particularly benefits from the presence of resets.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Random Quadratic Transportation Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the validity of asymptotic limits for the general transportation problem between random i.i.d. points and their common distribution, with respect to the squared Euclidean distance cost, in any dimension larger than three. Previous results were essentially limited to the two (or one) dimensional case, or to distributions whose absolutely continuous part is uniform.
  The proof relies upon recent advances in the stability theory of optimal transportation, combined with functional analytic techniques and some ideas from quantitative stochastic homogenization. The key tool we develop is a quantitative upper bound for the usual quadratic optimal transportation problem in terms of its boundary variant, where points can be freely transported along the boundary. The methods we use are applicable to more general random measures, including occupation measure of Brownian paths, and may open the door to further progress on challenging problems at the interface of analysis, probability, and discrete mathematics.</description>

      <title>Tilted Solid-On-Solid is liquid: scaling limit of SOS with a potential on a slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $(2+1)$D Solid-On-Solid (SOS) model famously exhibits a roughening transition: on an $N\times N$ torus with the height at the origin rooted at $0$, the variance of $h(x)$, the height at $x$, is $O(1)$ at large inverse-temperature $\beta$, vs. $\asymp \log |x|$ at small $\beta$ (as in the Gaussian free field (GFF)). The former--rigidity at large $\beta$--is known for a wide class of $|\nabla\phi|^p$ models ($p=1$ being SOS) yet is believed to fail once the surface is on a slope (tilted boundary conditions). It is conjectured that the slope would destabilize the rigidity and induce the GFF-type behavior of the surface at small $\beta$. The only rigorous result on this is by Sheffield (2005): for these models of integer height functions, if the slope $\theta$ is irrational, then Var$(h(x))\to\infty$ with $|x|$ (with no known quantitative bound).
  We study a family of SOS surfaces at a large enough fixed $\beta$, on an $N\times N$ torus with a nonzero boundary condition slope $\theta$, perturbed by a potential $V$ of strength $\epsilon_\beta$ per site (arbitrarily small). Our main result is (a) the measure on the height gradients $\nabla h$ has a weak limit $\mu_\infty$ as $N\to\infty$; and (b) the scaling limit of a sample from $\mu_\infty$ converges to a full plane GFF. In particular, we recover the asymptotics Var$(h(x))\sim c\log|x|$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a tilted $|\nabla\phi|^p$ model, or a perturbation thereof, where the limit is recovered at large $\beta$. The proof looks at random monotone surfaces that approximate the SOS surface, and shows that (i) these form a weakly interacting dimer model, and (ii) the renormalization framework of Giuliani, Mastropietro and Toninelli (2017) leads to the GFF limit. New ingredients are needed in both parts, including a nontrivial extension of [GMT17] from finite interactions to any long range summable interactions.</description>

      <title>The Yaglom limit for branching Brownian motion with absorption and slightly subcritical drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider branching Brownian motion with absorption in which particles move independently as one-dimensional Brownian motions with drift $-\rho$, each particle splits into two particles at rate one, and particles are killed when they reach the origin. Kesten (1978) showed that this process dies out with probability one if and only if $\rho \geq \sqrt{2}$. We show that in the subcritical case when $\rho &gt; \sqrt{2}$, the law of the process conditioned on survival until time $t$ converges as $t \rightarrow \infty$ to a quasi-stationary distribution, which we call the Yaglom limit. We give a construction of this quasi-stationary distribution. We also study the asymptotic behavior as $\rho \downarrow \sqrt{2}$ of this quasi-stationary distribution. We show that the logarithm of the number of particles and the location of the highest particle are of order $\epsilon^{-1/3}$, and we obtain a limit result for the empirical distribution of the particle locations.</description>

      <title>Quantitative propagation of chaos for non-exchangeable diffusions via first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a non-asymptotic approach to mean field approximations for systems of $n$ diffusive particles interacting pairwise. The interaction strengths are not identical, making the particle system non-exchangeable. The marginal law of any subset of particles is compared to a suitably chosen product measure, and we find sharp relative entropy estimates between the two. Building upon prior work of the first author in the exchangeable setting, we use a generalized form of the BBGKY hierarchy to derive a hierarchy of differential inequalities for the relative entropies. Our analysis of this complicated hierarchy exploits an unexpected but crucial connection with first-passage percolation, which lets us bound the marginal entropies in terms of expectations of functionals of this percolation process.</description>

      <title>Integral formulas for two-layer Schur and Whittaker processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary measures of last passage percolation with geometric weights and the log-gamma polymer in a strip of the $\mathbb Z^2$ lattice are characterized in arXiv:2306.05983 using variants of Schur and Whittaker processes, called two-layer Gibbs measures. In this article, we prove contour integral formulas characterizing the multipoint joint distribution of two-layer Schur and Whittaker processes. We also express them as Doob transformed Markov processes with explicit transition kernels. As an example of application of our formulas, we compute the growth rate of the KPZ equation on $[0,L]$ with arbitrary boundary parameters.</description>

      <title>Theoretical guarantees in KL for Diffusion Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) (also referred to as stochastic interpolants or rectified flows) stands out as a class of generative models that aims to bridge in finite time the target distribution $\nu^\star$ with an auxiliary distribution $\mu$, leveraging a fixed coupling $\pi$ and a bridge which can either be deterministic or stochastic. These two ingredients define a path measure which can then be approximated by learning the drift of its Markovian projection. The main contribution of this paper is to provide relatively mild assumptions on $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$ to obtain non-asymptotics guarantees for Diffusion Flow Matching (DFM) models using as bridge the conditional distribution associated with the Brownian motion. More precisely, we establish bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target distribution and the one generated by such DFM models under moment conditions on the score of $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$, and a standard $L^2$-drift-approximation error assumption.</description>

      <title>Improved Finite-Particle Convergence Rates for Stein Variational Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide finite-particle convergence rates for the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm in the Kernel Stein Discrepancy ($\mathsf{KSD}$) and Wasserstein-2 metrics. Our key insight is the observation that the time derivative of the relative entropy between the joint density of $N$ particle locations and the $N$-fold product target measure, starting from a regular initial distribution, splits into a dominant `negative part' proportional to $N$ times the expected $\mathsf{KSD}^2$ and a smaller `positive part'. This observation leads to $\mathsf{KSD}$ rates of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, providing a near optimal double exponential improvement over the recent result by~\cite{shi2024finite}. Under mild assumptions on the kernel and potential, these bounds also grow linearly in the dimension $d$. By adding a bilinear component to the kernel, the above approach is used to further obtain Wasserstein-2 convergence. For the case of `bilinear + Mat\'ern' kernels, we derive Wasserstein-2 rates that exhibit a curse-of-dimensionality similar to the i.i.d. setting. We also obtain marginal convergence and long-time propagation of chaos results for the time-averaged particle laws.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of $A_\infty$ Weights in Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a discrete weighted version of Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund decomposition from the perspective of dyadic grid in ergodic theory. Based on the decomposition, we study discrete $A_\infty$ weights. First, characterizations of the reverse H\"{o}lder's inequality and their extensions are obtained. Second, the properties of $A_\infty$ are given, specifically $A_\infty$ implies the reverse H\"{o}lder's inequality. Finally, under a doubling condition on weights, $A_\infty$ follows from the reverse H\"{o}lder's inequality. This means that we obtain equivalent characterizations of $A_{\infty}$. Because $A_{\infty}$ implies the doubling condition, it seems reasonable to assume the condition.</description>

      <title>Shifts of Finite Type Obtained by Forbidding a Single Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite word $w$, Guibas and Odlyzko (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 30, 1981, 183-208) showed that the autocorrelation polynomial $\phi_w(t)$ of $w$, which records the set of self-overlaps of $w$, explicitly determines for each $n$, the number $|B_n(w)|$ of words of length $n$ that avoid $w$. We consider this and related problems from the viewpoint of symbolic dynamics, focusing on the setting of $X_{\{w\}}$, the space of all bi-infinite sequences that avoid $w$. We first summarize and elaborate upon (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 30, 1981, 183-208) and other work to show that the sequence $|B_n(w)|$ is equivalent to several invariants of $X_{\{w\}}$. We then give a finite-state labeled graphical representation $L_w$ of $X_{\{w\}}$ and show that $w$ can be recovered from the graph isomorphism class of the unlabeled version of $L_w$. Using $L_w$, we apply ideas from probability and Perron-Frobenius theory to obtain results comparing features of $X_{\{w\}}$ for different $w$. Next, we give partial results on the problem of classifying the spaces $X_{\{w\}}$ up to conjugacy. Finally, we extend some of our results to spaces of multi-dimensional arrays that avoid a given finite pattern.</description>

      <title>Semimartingale properties of a generalized fractional Brownian motion and its mixtures with applications in asset pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.00975v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semimartingale properties for the generalized fractional Brownian motion (GFBM) introduced by Pang and Taqqu (2019) and discuss the applications of the GFBM and its mixtures to financial asset pricing. The GFBM is self-similar and has non-stationary increments, whose Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$ is determined by two parameters. We identify the regions of these two parameter values where the GFBM is a semimartingale.
  We next study the mixed process made up of an independent BM and a GFBM and identify the range of parameters for it to be a semimartingale, which leads to $H \in (1/2,1)$ for the GFBM. We also derive the associated equivalent Brownian measure. This result is in great contrast with the mixed FBM with $H \in \{1/2\}\cup(3/4,1]$ proved by Cheridito (2001) and shows the significance of the additional parameter introduced in the GFBM.
  We then study the semimartingale asset pricing theory with the mixed GFBM, in presence of long range dependence, and applications in option pricing and portfolio optimization. Finally we discuss the implications of using GFBM on arbitrage theory, in particular, providing an example of semimartingale asset pricing model of long range dependence without arbitrage.</description>

      <title>Viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equation in $RCD(K,\infty)$ spaces and applications to large deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold.
  - In the setting of RCD(K,$\infty$) metric measure spaces, we derive uniform gradient and Laplacian contraction estimates along solutions of the viscous approximation of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We use these estimates to prove that, as the viscosity tends to zero, solutions of this equation converge to the evolution driven by the Hopf--Lax formula, in accordance with the smooth case.
  - We then use such convergence to study the small-time Large Deviation Principle for both the heat kernel and the Brownian motion: we obtain the expected behavior under the additional assumption that the space is proper.
  As an application of the latter point, we also discuss the $\Gamma$-convergence of the Schr\"odinger problem to the quadratic optimal transport problem in proper RCD(K,$\infty$) spaces.</description>

Weak uniqueness (generally conditional) and a conjecture pertaining to strong solutions are also discussed. Our results are new even if the drift term vanishes.</description>

      <title>Some criteria of rational-infinite divisibility for probability laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ of distribution functions $F$ that have the property of rational-infinite divisibility: there exist some infinitely divisible distribution functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $F_1=F*F_2$. The class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is a wide natural extension of the fundamental class of infinitely divisible distribution functions. We are interested in general conditions to belong to the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ in terms of characteristic functions. We obtain criteria that seem to be convenient for the application for some cases, and we illustrate it by several examples in the paper.</description>

      <title>Reflection coupling for unadjusted generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in the nonconvex stochastic gradient case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contraction in Wasserstein 1-distance with explicit rates is established for generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with stochastic gradients under possibly nonconvex conditions. The algorithms considered include splitting schemes of kinetic Langevin diffusion commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations. To accommodate the degenerate noise structure corresponding to inertia existing in the chain, a characteristically discrete-in-time coupling and contraction proof is devised. As consequence, quantitative Gaussian concentration bounds are provided for empirical averages. Convergence in Wasserstein 2-distance and total variation are also given, together with numerical bias estimates.</description>

      <title>Correlation inequalities for linear extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the combinatorial atlas technology to prove new correlation inequalities for the number of linear extensions of finite posets. These include the approximate independence of probabilities and expectations of values of random linear extensions, closely related to Stanley's inequality. We also give applications to the numbers of standard Young tableaux and to Euler numbers.</description>
