      <title>Bias Reduction in Social Networks through Agent-Based Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks use recommender systems to suggest relevant information to their users in the form of personalized timelines. Studying how these systems expose people to information at scale is difficult to do as one cannot assume each user is subject to the same timeline condition and building appropriate evaluation infrastructure is costly. We show that a simple agent-based model where users have fixed preferences affords us the ability to compare different recommender systems (and thus different personalized timelines) in their ability to skew users' perception of their network. Importantly, we show that a simple greedy algorithm that constructs a feed based on network properties reduces such perception biases comparable to a random feed. This underscores the influence network structure has in determining the effectiveness of recommender systems in the social network context and offers a tool for mitigating perception biases through algorithmic feed construction.</description>

      <title>Wildlife Product Trading in Online Social Networks: A Case Study on Ivory-Related Product Sales Promotion Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildlife trafficking (WLT) has emerged as a global issue, with traffickers expanding their operations from offline to online platforms, utilizing e-commerce websites and social networks to enhance their illicit trade. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and recognizing wildlife product sales promotion behaviors in online social networks, a crucial aspect in combating these environmentally harmful activities. To counter these environmentally damaging illegal operations, in this research, we focus on wildlife product sales promotion behaviors in online social networks. Specifically, 1) A scalable dataset related to wildlife product trading is collected using a network-based approach. This dataset is labeled through a human-in-the-loop machine learning process, distinguishing positive class samples containing wildlife product selling posts and hard-negatives representing normal posts misclassified as potential WLT posts, subsequently corrected by human annotators. 2) We benchmark the machine learning results on the proposed dataset and build a practical framework that automatically identifies suspicious wildlife selling posts and accounts, sufficiently leveraging the multi-modal nature of online social networks. 3) This research delves into an in-depth analysis of trading posts, shedding light on the systematic and organized selling behaviors prevalent in the current landscape. We provide detailed insights into the nature of these behaviors, contributing valuable information for understanding and countering illegal wildlife product trading.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Drift: A Simulation Framework to Study the Effects of Recommender Systems on User Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital platforms such as social media and e-commerce websites adopt Recommender Systems to provide value to the user. However, the social consequences deriving from their adoption are still unclear. Many scholars argue that recommenders may lead to detrimental effects, such as bias-amplification deriving from the feedback loop between algorithmic suggestions and users' choices. Nonetheless, the extent to which recommenders influence changes in users leaning remains uncertain. In this context, it is important to provide a controlled environment for evaluating the recommendation algorithm before deployment. To address this, we propose a stochastic simulation framework that mimics user-recommender system interactions in a long-term scenario. In particular, we simulate the user choices by formalizing a user model, which comprises behavioral aspects, such as the user resistance towards the recommendation algorithm and their inertia in relying on the received suggestions. Additionally, we introduce two novel metrics for quantifying the algorithm's impact on user preferences, specifically in terms of drift over time. We conduct an extensive evaluation on multiple synthetic datasets, aiming at testing the robustness of our framework when considering different scenarios and hyper-parameters setting. The experimental results prove that the proposed methodology is effective in detecting and quantifying the drift over the users preferences by means of the simulation. All the code and data used to perform the experiments are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Capturing Tie Strength with Algebraic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The association between tie strength and social structure is a fundamental topic in the social sciences. We study this association by analyzing tie strength in higher-order networks, an increasingly relevant model which can encode group interactions between three or more individuals. First, we introduce three measures based on algebraic topology which characterize the network context and influence of an edge. Our experimental results across 15 datasets indicate that these measures outperform standard network proxies in estimating tie strength. We further find that these measures can replicate and explain a puzzle wherein certain bridging ties are surprisingly strong. We then consider a single centrality measure which combines the three initial measures, is highly inversely related to tie strength, and can be interpreted through an information exchange process which highlights ties that have access to useful information. In this sense, we are able to illuminate the information advantages of weak ties due to their network position.</description>

      <title>Linking Datasets on Organizations Using Half A Billion Open-Collaborated Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02533v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scholars studying organizations often work with multiple datasets lacking shared identifiers or covariates. In such situations, researchers usually use approximate string ("fuzzy") matching methods to combine datasets. String matching, although useful, faces fundamental challenges. Even where two strings appear similar to humans, fuzzy matching often struggles because it fails to adapt to the informativeness of the character combinations. In response, a number of machine learning methods have been developed to refine string matching. Yet, the effectiveness of these methods is limited by the size and diversity of training data. This paper introduces data from a prominent employment networking site (LinkedIn) as a massive training corpus to address these limitations. By leveraging information from the LinkedIn corpus regarding organizational name-to-name links, we incorporate trillions of name pair examples into various methods to enhance existing matching benchmarks and performance by explicitly maximizing match probabilities. We also show how relationships between organization names can be modeled using a network representation of the LinkedIn data. In illustrative merging tasks involving lobbying firms, we document improvements when using the LinkedIn corpus in matching calibration and make all data and methods open source.</description>

      <title>Collective memory, consensus, and learning explained by social cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans cluster in social groups where they discuss their shared past, problems, and potential solutions; they learn collectively when they repeat activities; they establish social norms; they synchronize when they sing or dance together; and they bond through social cohesion. A group is more cohesive if its members are closer together in their network and are bonded by multiple connections. Network proximity and redundancy are indicated by the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the group network, called the algebraic connectivity. This eigenvalue is key to explaining and predicting the outcomes of said activities.</description>
