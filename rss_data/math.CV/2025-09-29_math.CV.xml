      <title>On topology and singularities of quadrature domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a linear upper bound for the number of singular points on the boundary of a quadrature domain, improving a previously known quadratic bound due to Gustafsson \cite{Gus88}. This linear upper bound on the number of boundary double points also strengthens the bound on the connectivity (i.e., the number of complementary components) of a quadrature domain given by Lee and Makarov \cite{LM16}. Our proofs use conformal dynamics and hyperbolic geometry arguments. Finally, we introduce a new dynamical method to construct multiply connected quadrature domains.</description>

      <title>On Bergman projections and sharp decomposition theorems in tubular and related domains in $C^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of analytic function spaces in very general tubular domains over symmetric cones is a relatively new interesting research area. Tube domains are very general and very complicated domains. Recently several new results in this research area were provided in papers of B. Sehba and his coauthors concerning Bergman type operators in such type complicated unbounded domains. In this note we expand their results to certain spaces of analytic functions in products of tube domains. We define new integral operators of Bergman type and new analytic mixed norm spaces in such type domains and products of tube domains and provide new results on boundedness of certain Bergman type operators. Our results may have various nice applications in this research area. Our results with very similar proofs may be valid in Siegel domains of second type, in bounded symmetric domains and bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains with the smooth boundary, various matrix domains. We will add at the end of this note a new sharp decomposition theorem for Bergman space. Previously such type sharp decomposition theorems in analytic function spaces were provided by author in other domains. Our sharp result in Bergman type function spaces enlarge that list of previously known such type assertions in analytic function spaces of several variables. We finnaly pose in addition various interesting new problems related to this research area and moreover indicate also some concrete schemes for solutions of these problems. We also provide in the second part of this note many interesting short comments and remarks.</description>

      <title>Point evaluation for polynomials on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the constant $\mathscr{C}_{d,p}$ defined as the smallest constant $C$ such that $\|P\|_\infty^p \leq C\|P\|_p^p$ holds for every polynomial $P$ of degree $d$, where we consider the $L^p$ norm on the unit circle. We conjecture that $\mathscr{C}_{d,p} \leq dp/2+1$ for all $p \geq 2$ and all degrees $d$. We show that the conjecture holds for all $p \geq 2$ when $d \leq 4$ and for all $d$ when $p \geq 6.8$.</description>

      <title>Extremal polynomials for the Rogosinski--Szeg\H{o} estimates of the third coefficient of nonnegative sine polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the class of normalized sine-polynomials $S(t),$ non-negative on $[0,\pi],$ W.Rogosinski and G.Szeg\H{o} 1950 considered a number of extremal problems and proved, among other things, sharp upper and lower estimates for the coefficient $a_3.$ Their proof is based on the Luk\'acs representation of non-negative algebraic polynomials. This method does not lead to the construction of polynomials attaining the extreme values.
  We consider the corresponding problem in the framework of normalized typically real polynomials $P(z)$ on the unit disc in $\mathbb C.$ By L.Fej\'er's method with the additional use of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and their derivatives, we regain the sharp upper and lower estimates for $a_3$ and identify the extremal polynomials. The corresponding statements for sine polynomials follow by the observation $S(t)=\text{Im}\{P(e^{it})\}$. For odd $N$ the extremizers are unique, for even $N$ there is a one-parameter family of extremizers.</description>

      <title>$(m, \psi, \delta)-$capacity and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of the generalized $(m, \psi, \delta)-$capacity in the complex space $\mathbb{C}^n$, within the class of $m-$subharmonic functions. We give a relation between $(m, \psi, \delta)-$capacity and $(m, \psi, \delta)-$subharmonic measure. Moreover, we prove that the capacity vanishes on $m-$polar sets and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Norms of Chebyshev and Faber polynomials on curves with corners and cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $n$th Chebyshev polynomial $T_{n}$ of a piecewise Dini-smooth Jordan curve $\Gamma$ satisfies \[ \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\|T_{n}\|_{\Gamma}}{\mathrm{cap}(\Gamma)^n}=1, \] where $\|\cdot\|_\Gamma$ is the supremum norm over $\Gamma$ and $\mathrm{cap}(\Gamma)$ its logarithmic capacity. This extends earlier results for smooth curves to curves with corner singularities, including cusps. The proof makes use of weighted Faber polynomials, which we analyze using a Fourier analytic representation of the standard Faber polynomials due to Pommerenke. We moreover obtain new asymptotic bounds for the norm of Faber polynomials which are sharp if, for instance, all corners have exterior angle greater than $\pi$.</description>
