      <title>Approximation properties of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify some results of Bagaria and Magidor \cite{MR3152715} about the relationship between large cardinals and torsion classes of abelian groups, and prove that (1) the Maximum Deconstructibility principle introduced in \cite{Cox_MaxDecon} requires large cardinals; it sits, implication-wise, between Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. (2) While deconstructibility of a class of modules always implies the precovering property by \cite{MR2822215}, the concepts are (consistently) non-equivalent, even for classes of abelian groups closed under extensions, homomorphic images, and colimits.</description>

      <title>Finite local principal ideal rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07664v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every finite local principal ideal ring is the homomorphic image of a discrete valuation ring of a number field, and is determined by five invariants. We present an action of a group, non-commutative in general, on the set of Eisenstein polynomials, of degree matching the ramification index of the ring, over the coefficient ring. The action is defined by taking resultants.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of fiber products and idealization rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to provide formulas for the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of fiber products and idealization rings. We calculate the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a fiber product $R \times_T S$, with $R$, $S$ and $T$ being Noetherian local rings with common characteristic and residue field. Inspired by a work of Strazzanti and Armengou we calculate the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of an idealization ring $R \ltimes M$, where $M$ is a finite $R$-module. We explore certain examples and structural consequences and obtain some bounds for the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity.</description>

      <title>A multistep strategy for polynomial system solving over finite fields and a new algebraic attack on the stream cipher Trivium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multistep generalization of the guess-and-determine or hybrid strategy for solving a system of multivariate polynomial equations over a finite field. In particular, we propose performing the exhaustive evaluation of a subset of variables stepwise, that is, by incrementing the size of such subset each time that an evaluation leads to a polynomial system which is possibly unfeasible to solve. The decision about which evaluation to extend is based on a preprocessing consisting in computing an incomplete Grobner basis after the current evaluation, which possibly generates linear polynomials that are used to eliminate further variables. If the number of remaining variables in the system is deemed still too high, the evaluation is extended and the preprocessing is iterated. Otherwise, we solve the system by a complete Grobner basis computation.
  Having in mind cryptanalytic applications, we present an implementation of this strategy in an algorithm called MultiSolve which is designed for polynomial systems having at most one solution. We prove explicit formulas for its complexity which are based on probability distributions that can be easily estimated by performing the proposed preprocessing on a testset of evaluations for different subsets of variables. We prove that an optimal complexity of MultiSolve is achieved by using a full multistep strategy with a maximum number of steps and in turn the standard guess-and-determine strategy, which essentially is a strategy consisting of a single step, is the worst choice. Finally, we extensively study the behaviour of MultiSolve when performing an algebraic attack on the well-known stream cipher Trivium.</description>
