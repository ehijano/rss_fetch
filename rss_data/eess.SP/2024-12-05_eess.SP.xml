      <title>Energy-Efficient Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Wireless Fronthaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO improves the fairness among the user equipments (UEs) in the network by distributing many cooperating access points (APs) around the region while connecting them to a centralized cloud-computing unit that coordinates joint transmission/reception. However, the fiber cable deployment for the fronthaul transport network and activating all available antennas at each AP lead to increased deployment cost and power consumption for fronthaul signaling and processing. To overcome these challenges, in this work, we consider wireless fronthaul connections and propose a joint antenna activation and power allocation algorithm to minimize the end-to-end (from radio to cloud) power while satisfying the quality-of-service requirements of the UEs under wireless fronthaul capacity limitations. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology of deactivating antennas at each AP reduces the power consumption by 50% and 84% compared to the benchmarks based on shutting down APs and minimizing only the transmit power, respectively.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Sensing: A Nested Tensor Decomposition-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a monostatic multiple-input multiple-output sensing scenario assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface using tensor signal modeling. We propose a method that exploits the intrinsic multidimensional structure of the received echo signal, allowing us to recast the target sensing problem as a nested tensor-based decomposition problem to jointly estimate the delay, Doppler, and angular information of the target. We derive a two-stage approach based on the alternating least squares algorithm followed by the estimation of the signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques to extract the target parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed tensor-based algorithm yields accurate estimates of the sensing parameters with low complexity.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Measurement System for the Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper mid-band (or FR3, spanning 6-24 GHz) is a crucial frequency range for next-generation mobile networks, offering a favorable balance between coverage and spectrum efficiency. From another perspective, the systems operating in the near-field in both indoor environment and outdoor environments can support line-of-sight multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communications and be beneficial from the FR3 bands. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to measure the near-field parameters leveraging a recently developed reflection model where the near-field paths can be described by their image points. We show that these image points can be accurately estimated via triangulation from multiple measurements with a small number of antennas in each measurement, thus affording a low-cost procedure for near-field multi-path parameter extraction. A preliminary experimental apparatus is presented comprising 2 transmit and 2 receive antennas mounted on a linear track to measure the 2x2 MIMO channel at various displacements. The system uses a recently-developed wideband radio frequency (RF) transceiver board with fast frequency switching, an FPGA for fast baseband processing, and a new parameter extraction method to recover paths and spherical characteristics from the multiple 2x2 measurements.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel estimation problem has been widely discussed in traditional reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted multiple-input multiple-output. However, solutions for channel estimation adapted to beyond diagonal RIS need further study, and few recent works have been proposed to tackle this problem. Moreover, methods that avoid or minimize the use of pilot sequences are of interest. This work formulates a data-driven (semi-blind) joint channel and symbol estimation algorithm for beyond diagonal RIS that avoids a prior pilot-assisted stage while providing decoupled estimates of the involved communication channels. The proposed receiver builds upon a PARATUCK tensor model for the received signal, from which a trilinear alternating estimation scheme is derived. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate the proposed method's performance for selected system setups. The symbol error rate performance is also compared with that of a linear receiver operating with perfect knowledge of the cascaded channel.</description>

      <title>Sensing and Mitigation of Multi-Scatterer Self-Interference for Full-Duplex MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the joint use of digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC) and spatial suppression to mitigate far-field self-interference (SI) in full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Far-field SI, caused by echoes from environmental scatterers, is modeled based on the scatterers' angle and delay parameters, stored in a scatterer map. For each scatterer, the most suitable action regarding communication is selected from transmit beamforming, receive beamforming, DSIC, and no-action. This selection is based on simple metrics that show the expected uplink and downlink communication performance. In addition, emerging scatterers that deteriorate the communication are detected, and their delay and angles are acquired, providing an up-to-date scatterer map and presenting a \emph{sensing for communication} case. The proposed selection policy is compared with the individual implementations of DSIC and spatial suppression, highlighting the failure cases for each. It is shown that the proposed policy stays unaffected in these problematic cases and achieves SI-free performance.</description>

      <title>Real-Time AIoT for UAV Antenna Interference Detection via Edge-Cloud Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fifth-generation (5G) era, eliminating communication interference sources is crucial for maintaining network performance. Interference often originates from unauthorized or malfunctioning antennas, and radio monitoring agencies must address numerous sources of such antennas annually. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve inspection efficiency. However, the data transmission delay in the existing cloud-only (CO) artificial intelligence (AI) mode fails to meet the low latency requirements for real-time performance. Therefore, we propose a computer vision-based AI of Things (AIoT) system to detect antenna interference sources for UAVs. The system adopts an optimized edge-cloud collaboration (ECC+) mode, combining a keyframe selection algorithm (KSA), focusing on reducing end-to-end latency (E2EL) and ensuring reliable data transmission, which aligns with the core principles of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). At the core of our approach is an end-to-end antenna localization scheme based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, including a detector (EdgeAnt) and a tracker (AntSort). EdgeAnt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.1% on our custom antenna interference source dataset, requiring only 3 million parameters and 14.7 GFLOPs. On the COCO dataset, EdgeAnt achieves 38.9% mAP with 5.4 GFLOPs. We deployed EdgeAnt on Jetson Xavier NX (TRT) and Raspberry Pi 4B (NCNN), achieving real-time inference speeds of 21.1 (1088) and 4.8 (640) frames per second (FPS), respectively. Compared with CO mode, the ECC+ mode reduces E2EL by 88.9%, increases accuracy by 28.2%. Additionally, the system offers excellent scalability for coordinated multiple UAVs inspections. The detector code is publicly available at https://github.com/SCNU-RISLAB/EdgeAnt.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to Enhance Channel Sampling Patterns in Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, estimating the micro-Doppler (mD) spectrogram of a target requires combining channel estimates retrieved from communication with ad-hoc sensing packets, which cope with the sparsity of the communication traffic. Hence, the mD quality depends on the transmission strategy of the sensing packets, which is still a challenging problem with no known solutions. In this letter, we design a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that fragments such a problem into a sequence of simpler decisions and takes advantage of the mD temporal evolution for maximizing the reconstruction performance. Our method is the first that learns sampling patterns to directly optimize the mD quality, enabling the adaptation of ISAC systems to variable communication traffic. We validate the proposed approach on a dataset of real channel measurements, reaching up to 40% higher mD reconstruction accuracy and several times lower computational complexity than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Achieving Beamfocusing via Two Separated Uniform Linear Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates coordinated beamforming using a modular linear array (MLA), composed of a pair of physically separated uniform linear arrays (ULAs), treated as sub-arrays. We focus on how such setups can give rise to near-field effects in 6G networks without requiring many antennas. Unlike conventional far-field beamforming, near-field beamforming enables simultaneous data service to multiple users at different distances in the same angular direction, offering significant multiplexing gains. We present a detailed analysis, including analytical expressions of the beamwidth and beamdepth for the MLA. Our findings reveal that using the MLA approach, we can remove approximately 36% of the antennas in the ULA while achieving the same level of beamfocusing.</description>

      <title>How Should One Fit Channel Measurements to Fading Distributions for Performance Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling plays a pivotal role in optimizing communication systems, especially as new frequency bands come into play in next-generation networks. In this regard, fitting field measurements to stochastic models is crucial for capturing the key propagation features and to map these to achievable system performances. In this work, we shed light onto what's the most appropriate alternative for channel fitting, when the ultimate goal is performance analysis. Results show that average-error metrics should be used with caution, since they can largely fail to predict outage probability measures. We show that supremum-error fitting metrics with tail awareness are more robust to estimate both ergodic and outage performance measures, even when they yield a larger average-error fitting.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Hybrid MIMO Systems With Array Model Errors and Beam Squint Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a channel estimation method for hybrid wideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems in high-frequency bands, including millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz), in the presence of beam squint effects and array errors arising from hardware impairments and environmental time fluctuations such as thermal effects and dynamic motion of the array. Although conventional channel estimation methods calibrate array errors through offline operation with large training pilots, the calibration errors remain due to time-varying array errors. Therefore, the proposed channel estimation method calibrates array errors online with small pilot overhead. In the proposed method, array response matrices are explicitly decomposed into a small number of physical parameters including path gains, angles and array errors, which are iteratively estimated by alternating optimization based on a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. To enhance the convergence performance, we introduce a switching mechanism from an ongrid algorithm to an off-gird algorithm depending on the estimation accuracy of the array error during algorithmic iterations. Furthermore, we introduce an approximate mutual coupling model to reduce the number of parameters. The reduction of parameters not only lowers computational complexity but also mitigates overfitting to noisy observations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively works online even with small pilot overhead in the presence of array errors.</description>

      <title>User-Movement-Robust Virtual Reality Through Dual-Beam Reception in mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the mmWave band can potentially achieve the high data rate needed for realistic and seamless interaction within a virtual reality (VR) application. To this end, beamforming in both the access point (AP) and head-mounted display (HMD) sides is necessary. The main challenge in this use case is the specific and highly dynamic user movement, which causes beam misalignment, degrading the received signal level and potentially leading to outages. This study examines mmWave-based coordinated multi-point networks for VR applications, where two or multiple APs cooperatively transmit the signals to an HMD for connectivity diversity. Instead of using omnireception, we propose dual-beam reception based on the analog beamforming at the HMD, enhancing the receive beamforming gain towards serving APs while achieving diversity. Evaluation using actual HMD movement data demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing a reduction in outage rates of up to 13% compared to quasi-omnidirectional reception with two serving APs, and a 17% decrease compared to steerable single-beam reception with a serving AP. Widening the separation angle between two APs can further reduce outage rates due to head rotation as rotations can still be tracked using the steerable multi-beam, albeit at the expense of received signal levels reduction during the non-outage period.</description>

      <title>Galvanic Body-Coupled Powering for Wireless Implanted Neurostimulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Body-coupled powering (BCP) is an innovative wireless power transfer (WPT) technique, recently explored for its potential to deliver power to cutting-edge biomedical implants such as nerve and muscle stimulators. This paper demonstrates the efficient technique of designing WPT systems embedding BCP via galvanic coupling (G-BCP). The G-BCP configuration utilizes two metal circular rings surrounding the body area of interest as the transmitter (TX) electrodes required for galvanic (differential) excitation and a wireless implant as the receiver (RX) equipped with two electrodes for differential power reception accordingly. By focusing on the unique advantages of this approach - such as enhanced targeting accuracy, improved power transfer efficiency (PTE), and favorable tissue penetration characteristics, G-BCP emerges as a superior alternative to traditional WPT methods. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to obtain the optimized device parameters while simultaneously allowing flexible placement of implants at different depths and alignments. To substantiate the proposed design concept, a prototype was simulated in Ansys HFSS, employing a multi-layered tissue medium of 10mm radius and targeting the sciatic nerve of a rat. Impressively, this prototype achieves &gt; 20% PTE at 1.25 GHz, with the implant (radius of RX electrodes = 1 mm) located 2 mm deep inside the tissue model having complex load impedance of Rload = 1000 Ohm and Cload = 5pF. Therefore, the G-BCP-based wirelessly powered microdevices are envisaged to be a key enabler in neural recording and stimulation, specifically for the peripheral nervous system, enhancing therapeutic outcomes and patient experiences.</description>

Abstract: Meeting the high data rate demands of modern applications necessitates the utilization of high-frequency spectrum bands, including millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz bands. However, these frequencies require precise alignment of narrow communication beams between transmitters and receivers, typically resulting in significant beam training overhead. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end vision-aided beamforming framework that utilizes images to predict optimal beams while considering geometric adjustments to reduce overhead. Our model demonstrates robust adaptability to dynamic environments without relying on additional training data where the experimental results indicate a top-5 beam prediction accuracy of 98.96%, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art solutions in vision-aided beamforming.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Mobile Target Tracking Using Consensus-Based Estimation with Nearly-Constant-Velocity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile target tracking is crucial in various applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. This study presents a decentralized tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF) integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving target's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to collaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations and achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement noise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness by mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error (MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized environments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Channel Reflection: Knowledge-Driven Data Augmentation for EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices. Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are currently the most popular for able-bodied users. To increase user-friendliness, usually a small amount of user-specific EEG data are used for calibration, which may not be enough to develop a pure data-driven decoding model. To cope with this typical calibration data shortage challenge in EEG-based BCIs, this paper proposes a parameter-free channel reflection (CR) data augmentation approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the channel distributions of different BCI paradigms in data augmentation. Experiments on eight public EEG datasets across four different BCI paradigms (motor imagery, steady-state visual evoked potential, P300, and seizure classifications) using different decoding algorithms demonstrated that: 1) CR is effective, i.e., it can noticeably improve the classification accuracy; 2) CR is robust, i.e., it consistently outperforms existing data augmentation approaches in the literature; and, 3) CR is flexible, i.e., it can be combined with other data augmentation approaches to further increase the performance. We suggest that data augmentation approaches like CR should be an essential step in EEG-based BCIs. Our code is available online.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Personalized Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) unifies communication and model aggregation by leveraging the inherent superposition property of the wireless medium. This strategy can enable scalable and bandwidth-efficient learning via simultaneous transmission of model updates using the same frequency resources, if care is exercised to design the physical layer jointly with learning. In this paper, a federated learning system facilitated by a heterogeneous edge-intelligent network is considered. The edge users (clients) have differing user resources and non-i.i.d. local dataset distributions. A general non-convex learning objective is considered for the model training task(s) at hand. We augment the network with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in order to enhance the learning system. We propose a cross-layer algorithm that jointly assigns communication, computation and learning resources. In particular, we adaptively adjust the number of local steps in conjunction with RIS configuration to boost the learning performance. Our system model considers channel noise and channel estimation errors in both the uplink (model updates) and downlink (global model broadcast), employing dynamic power control for both. We provide the convergence analysis for the proposed algorithms and extend the frameworks to personalized learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art joint communication and learning baselines.</description>

      <title>From OTFS to AFDM: A Comparative Study of Next-Generation Waveforms for ISAC in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless systems will offer integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) functionalities not only in order to enable new applications, but also as a means to mitigate challenges such as doubly-dispersive channels, which arise in high mobility scenarios and/or at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands. An emerging approach to accomplish these goals is the design of new waveforms, which draw from the inherent relationship between the doubly-dispersive nature of time-variant (TV) channels and the environmental features of scatterers manifested in the form of multi-path delays and Doppler shifts. Examples of such waveforms are the delay-Doppler domain orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and the recently proposed chirp domain affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), both of which seek to simultaneously combat the detrimental effects of double selectivity and exploit them for the estimation (or sensing) of environmental information. This article aims to provide a consolidated and comprehensive overview of the signal processing techniques required to support reliable ISAC over doubly-dispersive channels in beyond fifth generation (B5G)/sixth generation (6G) systems, with an emphasis on OTFS and AFDM waveforms, as those, together with the traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, suffice to elaborate on the most relevant properties of the trend. The analysis shows that OTFS and AFDM indeed enable significantly improved robustness against inter-carrier interference (ICI) arising from Doppler shifts compared to OFDM. In addition, the inherent delay-Doppler domain orthogonality of the OTFS and AFDM effective channels is found to provide significant advantages for the design and the performance of integrated sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>Broadened-beam Uniform Rectangular Array Coefficient Design in LEO SatComs Under Quality of Service and Constant Modulus Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite communications (SatComs) are anticipated to deliver global Internet access. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (SATs) offer the advantage of higher downlink capacity due to their reduced link budget compared to medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) SATs. In this paper, beam broadening methods for uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) in LEO SatComs were studied. The proposed method is the first of its kind to jointly consider path loss variation from SAT to the user terminal (UT) due to the Earth's curvature to guarantee the quality of service (QoS), constant modulus constraints (CMCs) favored for maximizing power amplifier (PA) efficiency, and out-of-beam radiation suppression to avoid interference. A broadened-beam URA coefficient design problem is formulated and decomposed into two uniform linear array (ULA) design subproblems utilizing Kronecker product beamforming. With this decomposition, the number of beamforming coefficients that need to be optimized is significantly reduced compared to the original URA design problem. The non-convex ULA subproblems are addressed using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a convex iterative algorithm. Simulation results reveal the advantages of the proposed method for suppressing the out-of-beam radiation and achieving the design criteria. In addition, channel capacity evaluations are carried out. It demonstrates that the proposed "broadened-beam" beamformers can offer capacities that are at least four times greater than those of beamformers employing an array steering vector when the beam transition time is considered. The proposed method holds potential for LEO SAT broadcasting applications, such as digital video broadcasting (DVB).</description>

      <title>A Joint Data Compression and Time-Delay Estimation Method For Distributed Systems via Extremum Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the proliferation of mobile devices, we consider a basic form of the ubiquitous problem of time-delay estimation (TDE), but with communication constraints between two non co-located sensors. In this setting, when joint processing of the received signals is not possible, a compression technique that is tailored to TDE is desirable. For our basic TDE formulation, we develop such a joint compression-estimation strategy based on the notion of what we term "extremum encoding", whereby we send the index of the maximum of a finite-length time-series from one sensor to another. Subsequent joint processing of the encoded message with locally observed data gives rise to our proposed time-delay "maximum-index"-based estimator. We derive an exponentially tight upper bound on its error probability, establishing its consistency with respect to the number of transmitted bits. We further validate our analysis via simulations, and comment on potential extensions and generalizations of the basic methodology.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Visibility Graphs for Enhanced Arrhythmia Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrhythmias, detectable through electrocardiograms (ECGs), pose significant health risks, underscoring the need for accurate and efficient automated detection techniques. While recent advancements in graph-based methods have demonstrated potential to enhance arrhythmia classification, the challenge lies in effectively representing ECG signals as graphs. This study investigates the use of Visibility Graph (VG) and Vector Visibility Graph (VVG) representations combined with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for arrhythmia classification under the ANSI/AAMI standard, ensuring reproducibility and fair comparison with other techniques. Through extensive experiments on the MIT-BIH dataset, we evaluate various GCN architectures and preprocessing parameters. Our findings demonstrate that VG and VVG mappings enable GCNs to classify arrhythmias directly from raw ECG signals, without the need for preprocessing or noise removal. Notably, VG offers superior computational efficiency, while VVG delivers enhanced classification performance by leveraging additional lead features. The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in several metrics, although challenges persist in classifying the supraventricular ectopic beat (S) class, particularly under the inter-patient paradigm.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Enhanced ISAC Precoding for Vehicular Networks with Double Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is vital for vehicular networks, yet the time-varying communication channels and rapid movement of targets present significant challenges for real-time precoding design. Traditional optimization-based methods are computationally complex and depend on perfect prior information, which is often unavailable in double-dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a synesthesia of machine (SoM)-enhanced precoding paradigm that leverages modalities such as positioning and channel information to adapt to these dynamics. Utilizing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, our approach pushes ISAC performance boundaries. We also introduce a parameter-shared actor-critic architecture to accelerate training in complex state and action spaces. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive surgical procedure to record the electrical activities in cortical brain regions, aiming at identifying the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. To improve the accuracy of the EZ definition, SEEG analysis can be supported by computational tools, among which the Epileptogenic Index (EI) represents the most common solution. However, the scientific community has still not found an agreement on which quantitative biomarkers can characterize the cortical sites within the EZ. In this work, we design a new algorithm, named Desynchronization Index (DI), to assist neurophysiologists in SEEG interpretation. Our algorithm estimates the effective connectivity between cortical sites and hypothesizes that the EZ is identified by those sites getting abnormally desynchronized from the network during the seizure generation. We test the proposed method over a SEEG dataset of 10 seizures, comparing its accuracy in terms of EZ definition against the EI algorithm and clinical ground truth. Our results indicate that the DI algorithm underscores specific connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing sensitivity in detecting epileptogenic cortical sites.</description>

      <title>FDA-MIMO-Based Integrated Multi-Target Sensing and Communication System with Complex Coefficients Information Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The echo signals of frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) feature angle-range coupling, enabling simultaneous discrimination and estimation of multiple targets at different locations. In light of this, based on FDA-MIMO, this paper explores an sensing-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system for multi-target sensing. At the base station, we propose the FDA-MIMO-based spatial spectrum multi-target estimation (SSMTE) method, which first jointly estimates the angle and distance of targets and then estimates the velocities. To reduce the sensing computational complexity, the low-complexity spatial spectrum estimation (LCSSE) algorithm is proposed. LCSSE reduces the complexity without degrading the sensing performance by converting the joint angle-range search into two one-dimensional searches. To address the range ambiguity caused by frequency offset, a frequency offset design criterion (FODC) is proposed. It designs the integer and fractional components of the frequency offset to ensure the ambiguity distance exceeds the maximum sensing range, thereby alleviating parameters pairing errors. Moreover, the complex coefficients information embedding (CCIE) scheme is designed to improve system communication rates, which carries extra bits by selecting complex coefficients from the coefficient vector. The closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) tight upper bound and the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed system excels in multi-target sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Location and Map-Assisted Wideband Phase and Time Calibration Between Distributed Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output networks utilize a large number of distributed access points (APs) to serve multiple user equipments (UEs), offering significant potential for both communication and localization. However, these networks require frequent phase and time calibration between distributed antennas due to oscillator phase drifts, crucial for reciprocity-based coherent beamforming and accurate localization. While this calibration is typically performed through bi-directional measurements between antennas, it can be simplified to unidirectional measurement under perfect knowledge of antenna locations. This paper extends a recent phase calibration narrowband line-of-sight (LoS) model to a phase and time calibration wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing model, including both LoS and reflection paths and allowing for joint phase and time calibrations. We explore different scenarios, considering whether or not prior knowledge of antenna locations and the map is available. For each case, we introduce a practical maximum likelihood estimator and conduct Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analyses to benchmark performance. Simulations validate our estimators against the CRLB in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, achieving up to +0.29 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement at block error rate (BLER) = 0.35 in non-rainy and +0.25 at BLER = 0.2 in rainy conditions, ensuring superior visual quality compared to standard video coding (VC) methods across various conditions.</description>

      <title>Which Channel in 6G, Low-rank or Full-rank, more needs RIS?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13769v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as an efficient tool to improve receive signal-to-noise ratio, extend coverage and create more spatial diversity, is viewed as a most promising technique for the future wireless networks like 6G. As you know, RIS is very suitable for a special wireless scenario with wireless link between BS and users being completely blocked, i.e., no link. In this paper, we extend its applications to a general scenario, i.e., rank-deficient channel, particularly some extremely low-rank ones such as no link, and line-of-sight (LoS, rank-one). Actually, there are several potential important low-rank applications like low-altitude, satellite, UAV, marine, and deep-space communications. In such a situation, it is found that RIS may make a dramatic degrees of freedom (DoF) enhancement over no RIS. By using a distributed RISs placement, the DoF of channel from BS to user in LoS channel may be even boosted from a low-rank like 0/1 to full-rank. This will achieve an extremely rate improvement via spatial parallel multiple-stream transmission from BS to user. In this paper, we present a complete review of making an in-depth discussion on DoF effect of RIS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</description>

Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Combining wireless communication with large artificial intelligence (AI) models can open up a myriad of novel application scenarios. In sixth generation (6G) networks, ubiquitous communication and computing resources allow large AI models to serve democratic large AI models-related services to enable real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, the security considerations and sustainable communication resources limit the deployment of large AI models over distributed wireless networks. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of privacy, security, and trustworthy for distributed wireless large AI model (WLAM). In particular, a detailed privacy and security are analysis for distributed WLAM is fist revealed. The classifications and theoretical findings about privacy and security in distributed WLAM are discussed. Then the trustworthy and ethics for implementing distributed WLAM are described. Finally, the comprehensive applications of distributed WLAM are presented in the context of electromagnetic signal processing.</description>
