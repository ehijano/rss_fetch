      <title>Exploiting XAI maps to improve MS lesion segmentation and detection in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, several methods have been developed to explain deep learning algorithms for classification tasks. Recently, an adaptation of two of such methods has been proposed to generate instance-level explainable maps in a semantic segmentation scenario, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation. In the mentioned work, a 3D U-Net was trained and tested for MS lesion segmentation, yielding an F1 score of 0.7006, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.6265. The distribution of values in explainable maps exposed some differences between maps of true and false positive (TP/FP) examples. Inspired by those results, we explore in this paper the use of characteristics of lesion-specific saliency maps to refine segmentation and detection scores. We generate around 21000 maps from as many TP/FP lesions in a batch of 72 patients (training set) and 4868 from the 37 patients in the test set. 93 radiomic features extracted from the first set of maps were used to train a logistic regression model and classify TP versus FP. On the test set, F1 score and PPV were improved by a large margin when compared to the initial model, reaching 0.7450 and 0.7817, with 95% confidence intervals of [0.7358, 0.7547] and [0.7679, 0.7962], respectively. These results suggest that saliency maps can be used to refine prediction scores, boosting a model's performances.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Machine Learning-based Skin Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the reliability of two deep learning models for skin cancer detection, focusing on their explainability and fairness. Using the HAM10000 dataset of dermatoscopic images, the research assesses two convolutional neural network architectures: a MobileNet-based model and a custom CNN model. Both models are evaluated for their ability to classify skin lesions into seven categories and to distinguish between dangerous and benign lesions. Explainability is assessed using Saliency Maps and Integrated Gradients, with results interpreted by a dermatologist. The study finds that both models generally highlight relevant features for most lesion types, although they struggle with certain classes like seborrheic keratoses and vascular lesions. Fairness is evaluated using the Equalized Odds metric across sex and skin tone groups. While both models demonstrate fairness across sex groups, they show significant disparities in false positive and false negative rates between light and dark skin tones. A Calibrated Equalized Odds postprocessing strategy is applied to mitigate these disparities, resulting in improved fairness, particularly in reducing false negative rate differences. The study concludes that while the models show promise in explainability, further development is needed to ensure fairness across different skin tones. These findings underscore the importance of rigorous evaluation of AI models in medical applications, particularly in diverse population groups.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Multi-source Visual Prompt Tuning for Survival Analysis in Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis using pathology images poses a considerable challenge, as it requires the localization of relevant information from the multitude of tiles within whole slide images (WSIs). Current methods typically resort to a two-stage approach, where a pre-trained network extracts features from tiles, which are then used by survival models. This process, however, does not optimize the survival models in an end-to-end manner, and the pre-extracted features may not be ideally suited for survival prediction. To address this limitation, we present a novel end-to-end Visual Prompt Tuning framework for survival analysis, named VPTSurv. VPTSurv refines feature embeddings through an efficient encoder-decoder framework. The encoder remains fixed while the framework introduces tunable visual prompts and adaptors, thus permitting end-to-end training specifically for survival prediction by optimizing only the lightweight adaptors and the decoder. Moreover, the versatile VPTSurv framework accommodates multi-source information as prompts, thereby enriching the survival model. VPTSurv achieves substantial increases of 8.7% and 12.5% in the C-index on two immunohistochemical pathology image datasets. These significant improvements highlight the transformative potential of the end-to-end VPT framework over traditional two-stage methods.</description>

      <title>Mpox Screen Lite: AI-Driven On-Device Offline Mpox Screening for Low-Resource African Mpox Emergency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The 2024 Mpox outbreak, particularly severe in Africa with clade 1b emergence, has highlighted critical gaps in diagnostic capabilities in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, on-device screening tool for Mpox, designed to function offline in low-resource environments.
  Methods: We developed a YOLOv8n-based deep learning model trained on 2,700 images (900 each of Mpox, other skin conditions, and normal skin), including synthetic data. The model was validated on 360 images and tested on 540 images. A larger external validation was conducted using 1,500 independent images. Performance metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity.
  Findings: The model demonstrated high accuracy (96%) in the final test set. For Mpox detection, it achieved 93% precision, 97% recall, and an F1-score of 95%. Sensitivity and specificity for Mpox detection were 97% and 96%, respectively. Performance remained consistent in the larger external validation, confirming the model's robustness and generalizability.
  Interpretation: This AI-driven screening tool offers a rapid, accurate, and scalable solution for Mpox detection in resource-constrained settings. Its offline functionality and high performance across diverse datasets suggest significant potential for improving Mpox surveillance and management, particularly in areas lacking traditional diagnostic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Recon-all-clinical: Cortical surface reconstruction and analysis of heterogeneous clinical brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-based analysis of the cerebral cortex is ubiquitous in human neuroimaging with MRI. It is crucial for cortical registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation. Traditionally, these analyses require high-resolution, isotropic scans with good gray-white matter contrast, typically a 1mm T1-weighted scan. This excludes most clinical MRI scans, which are often anisotropic and lack the necessary T1 contrast. To enable large-scale neuroimaging studies using vast clinical data, we introduce recon-all-clinical, a novel method for cortical reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation in brain MRI scans of any resolution and contrast. Our approach employs a hybrid analysis method that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with domain randomization to predict signed distance functions (SDFs) and classical geometry processing for accurate surface placement while maintaining topological and geometric constraints. The method does not require retraining for different acquisitions, thus simplifying the analysis of heterogeneous clinical datasets. We tested recon-all-clinical on multiple datasets, including over 19,000 clinical scans. The method consistently produced precise cortical reconstructions and high parcellation accuracy across varied MRI contrasts and resolutions. Cortical thickness estimates are precise enough to capture aging effects independently of MRI contrast, although accuracy varies with slice thickness. Our method is publicly available at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/recon-all-clinical, enabling researchers to perform detailed cortical analysis on the huge amounts of already existing clinical MRI scans. This advancement may be particularly valuable for studying rare diseases and underrepresented populations where research-grade MRI data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Bi-modality Images Transfer with a Discrete Process Matching Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, medical image synthesis gains more and more popularity, along with the rapid development of generative models. Medical image synthesis aims to generate an unacquired image modality, often from other observed data modalities. Synthesized images can be used for clinical diagnostic assistance, data augmentation for model training and validation or image quality improving. In the meanwhile, the flow-based models are among the successful generative models for the ability of generating realistic and high-quality synthetic images. However, most flow-based models require to calculate flow ordinary different equation (ODE) evolution steps in transfer process, for which the performances are significantly limited by heavy computation time due to a large number of time iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based model, namely Discrete Process Matching (DPM) to accomplish the bi-modality image transfer tasks. Different to other flow matching based models, we propose to utilize both forward and backward ODE flow and enhance the consistency on the intermediate images of few discrete time steps, resulting in a transfer process with much less iteration steps while maintaining high-quality generations for both modalities. Our experiments on three datasets of MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI demonstrate that DPM outperforms other state-of-the-art flow-based methods for bi-modality image synthesis, achieving higher image quality with less computation time cost.</description>

      <title>EigenSR: Eigenimage-Bridged Pre-Trained RGB Learners for Single Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (single-HSI-SR) aims to improve the resolution of a single input low-resolution HSI. Due to the bottleneck of data scarcity, the development of single-HSI-SR lags far behind that of RGB natural images. In recent years, research on RGB SR has shown that models pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets can greatly improve performance on unseen data, which may stand as a remedy for HSI. But how can we transfer the pre-trained RGB model to HSI, to overcome the data-scarcity bottleneck? Because of the significant difference in the channels between the pre-trained RGB model and the HSI, the model cannot focus on the correlation along the spectral dimension, thus limiting its ability to utilize on HSI. Inspired by the HSI spatial-spectral decoupling, we propose a new framework that first fine-tunes the pre-trained model with the spatial components (known as eigenimages), and then infers on unseen HSI using an iterative spectral regularization (ISR) to maintain the spectral correlation. The advantages of our method lie in: 1) we effectively inject the spatial texture processing capabilities of the pre-trained RGB model into HSI while keeping spectral fidelity, 2) learning in the spectral-decorrelated domain can improve the generalizability to spectral-agnostic data, and 3) our inference in the eigenimage domain naturally exploits the spectral low-rank property of HSI, thereby reducing the complexity. This work bridges the gap between pre-trained RGB models and HSI via eigenimages, addressing the issue of limited HSI training data, hence the name EigenSR. Extensive experiments show that EigenSR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both spatial and spectral metrics. Our code will be released.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel transformer-based architecture for end-to-end image compression. Our architecture incorporates blocks that effectively capture local dependencies between tokens, eliminating the need for positional encoding by integrating convolutional operations within the multi-head attention mechanism. We demonstrate through experiments that our proposed framework surpasses state-of-the-art CNN-based architectures in terms of the trade-off between bit-rate and distortion and achieves comparable results to transformer-based methods while maintaining lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Feature Compression for Cloud-Edge Multimodal 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine vision systems, which can efficiently manage extensive visual perception tasks, are becoming increasingly popular in industrial production and daily life. Due to the challenge of simultaneously obtaining accurate depth and texture information with a single sensor, multimodal data captured by cameras and LiDAR is commonly used to enhance performance. Additionally, cloud-edge cooperation has emerged as a novel computing approach to improve user experience and ensure data security in machine vision systems. This paper proposes a pioneering solution to address the feature compression problem in multimodal 3D object detection. Given a sparse tensor-based object detection network at the edge device, we introduce two modes to accommodate different application requirements: Transmission-Friendly Feature Compression (T-FFC) and Accuracy-Friendly Feature Compression (A-FFC). In T-FFC mode, only the output of the last layer of the network's backbone is transmitted from the edge device. The received feature is processed at the cloud device through a channel expansion module and two spatial upsampling modules to generate multi-scale features. In A-FFC mode, we expand upon the T-FFC mode by transmitting two additional types of features. These added features enable the cloud device to generate more accurate multi-scale features. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset using the VirConv-L detection network showed that T-FFC was able to compress the features by a factor of 6061 with less than a 3% reduction in detection performance. On the other hand, A-FFC compressed the features by a factor of about 901 with almost no degradation in detection performance. We also designed optional residual extraction and 3D object reconstruction modules to facilitate the reconstruction of detected objects. The reconstructed objects effectively reflected details of the original objects.</description>

      <title>CISCA and CytoDArk0: a Cell Instance Segmentation and Classification method for histo(patho)logical image Analyses and a new, open, Nissl-stained dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delineating and classifying individual cells in microscopy tissue images is a complex task, yet it is a pivotal endeavor in various medical and biological investigations. We propose a new deep learning framework (CISCA) for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices to support detailed morphological and structural analysis or straightforward cell counting in digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture studies. At the core of CISCA lies a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The network outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately yields the segmentation of individual cells. A third head enables simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We showcase the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H\&amp;E datasets. Additionally, we introduce CytoDArk0, a novel dataset consisting of Nissl-stained images of the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus from mammals belonging to the orders Cetartiodactyla and Primates. We evaluate CISCA in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating CISCA's robustness and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Scanner Domain Shift on Deep Learning Performance in Medical Imaging: an Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Medical images acquired using different scanners and protocols can differ substantially in their appearance. This phenomenon, scanner domain shift, can result in a drop in the performance of deep neural networks which are trained on data acquired by one scanner and tested on another. This significant practical issue is well-acknowledged, however, no systematic study of the issue is available across different modalities and diagnostic tasks. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we present a broad experimental study evaluating the impact of scanner domain shift on convolutional neural network performance for different automated diagnostic tasks. We evaluate this phenomenon in common radiological modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. Results: We find that network performance on data from a different scanner is almost always worse than on same-scanner data, and we quantify the degree of performance drop across different datasets. Notably, we find that this drop is most severe for MRI, moderate for X-ray, and quite small for CT, on average, which we attribute to the standardized nature of CT acquisition systems which is not present in MRI or X-ray. We also study how injecting varying amounts of target domain data into the training set, as well as adding noise to the training data, helps with generalization. Conclusion: Our results provide extensive experimental evidence and quantification of the extent of performance drop caused by scanner domain shift in deep learning across different modalities, with the goal of guiding the future development of robust deep learning models for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Exploring Foundation Models for Synthetic Medical Imaging: A Study on Chest X-Rays and Fine-Tuning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced healthcare by aiding in disease prevention and treatment identification. However, accessing patient data can be challenging due to privacy concerns and strict regulations. Generating synthetic, realistic data offers a potential solution for overcoming these limitations, and recent studies suggest that fine-tuning foundation models can produce such data effectively. In this study, we explore the potential of foundation models for generating realistic medical images, particularly chest x-rays, and assess how their performance improves with fine-tuning. We propose using a Latent Diffusion Model, starting with a pre-trained foundation model and refining it through various configurations. Additionally, we performed experiments with input from a medical professional to assess the realism of the images produced by each trained model.</description>

      <title>Modeling Human Strategy for Flattening Wrinkled Cloth Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03764</link>

Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach to model strategies for flattening wrinkled cloth learning from humans. A human participant study was conducted where the participants were presented with various wrinkle types and tasked with flattening the cloth using the fewest actions possible. A camera and Aruco marker were used to capture images of the cloth and finger movements, respectively. The human strategies for flattening the cloth were modeled using a supervised regression neural network, where the cloth images served as input and the human actions as output. Before training the neural network, a series of image processing techniques were applied, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract relevant features from each image and reduce the input dimensionality. This reduction decreased the model's complexity and computational cost. The actions predicted by the neural network closely matched the actual human actions on an independent data set, demonstrating the effectiveness of neural networks in modeling human actions for flattening wrinkled cloth.</description>

      <title>AI and Entrepreneurship: Facial Recognition Technology Detects Entrepreneurs, Outperforming Human Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occupational outcomes like entrepreneurship are generally considered personal information that individuals should have the autonomy to disclose. With the advancing capability of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer private details from widely available human-centric data, such as social media, it is crucial to investigate whether AI can accurately extract private occupational information from such data. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks can classify individuals as entrepreneurs based on a single facial image with high accuracy in data sourced from Crunchbase, a premier source for entrepreneurship data. Utilizing a dataset comprising facial images of 40,728 individuals, including both entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and evaluated its classification performance. While human experts (n=650) and trained participants (n=133) were unable to classify entrepreneurs with accuracy above chance levels (&gt;50%), the AI model achieved a classification accuracy of 79.51%. Several robustness tests show that this high level of accuracy is maintained under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Computer-Generated Sand Mixtures and Sand-based Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to verify the effectiveness of the software implementation of the proposed algorithm in creating computer-generated images of sand mixtures using a photograph of sand as an input and its effectiveness in converting digital pictures into sand-based images out of the mixtures it generated. The method of this paper is to visually compare the photographed image of the actual mixtures to its computer-generated counterpart to verify if the mixture generation produces results as expected and compare the computer-generated sand-based images with its source to verify image reproduction maintains same image content. The results of the mixture comparison shows that the actual and the computer-generated ones have similar overall shade and color. Still, the generated one has a rougher texture and higher contrast due to the method of inheriting visual features by pixel, not by individual sand particles. The comparison of the sand-based image and its source has demonstrated the software's ability to maintain the essence of its contents during conversion while replacing its texture with the visual properties of the generated sand mixture. The result have shown that the software implementation of the proposed algorithm can effectively use the images of sand to generate images of its mixtures and use those mixture images to convert a digital picture into a computer-generated sand-based image.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Inspired Network for Context-Aware Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is threefold. We inform the AI practitioner about the human visual system with an extensive literature review; we propose a novel biologically motivated neural network for image classification; and, finally, we present a new plug-and-play module to model context awareness. We focus on the effect of incorporating circuit motifs found in biological brains to address visual recognition. Our convolutional architecture is inspired by the connectivity of human cortical and subcortical streams, and we implement bottom-up and top-down modulations that mimic the extensive afferent and efferent connections between visual and cognitive areas. Our Contextual Attention Block is simple and effective and can be integrated with any feed-forward neural network. It infers weights that multiply the feature maps according to their causal influence on the scene, modeling the co-occurrence of different objects in the image. We place our module at different bottlenecks to infuse a hierarchical context awareness into the model. We validated our proposals through image classification experiments on benchmark data and found a consistent improvement in performance and the robustness of the produced explanations via class activation.

      <title>Empirical Bayesian image restoration by Langevin sampling with a denoising diffusion implicit prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time. Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality and longer computing times. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model's posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.</description>

      <title>Connecting Image Inpainting with Denoising in the Homogeneous Diffusion Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While local methods for image denoising and inpainting may use similar concepts, their connections have hardly been investigated so far. The goal of this work is to establish links between the two by focusing on the most foundational scenario on both sides: the homogeneous diffusion setting. To this end, we study a denoising by inpainting (DbI) framework: It averages multiple inpainting results from different noisy subsets. We derive equivalence results between DbI on shifted regular grids and homogeneous diffusion filtering in 1D via an explicit relation between the density and the diffusion time. We also provide an empirical extension to the 2-D case. We present experiments that confirm our theory and suggest that it can also be generalized to diffusions with non-homogeneous data or non-homogeneous diffusivities. More generally, our work demonstrates that the hardly explored idea of data adaptivity deserves more attention: It can be as powerful as some popular models with operator adaptivity.</description>

      <title>RSF-Conv: Rotation-and-Scale Equivariant Fourier Parameterized Convolution for Retinal Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is of great clinical significance for the diagnosis of many eye-related diseases, but it is still a formidable challenge due to the intricate vascular morphology. With the skillful characterization of the translation symmetry existing in retinal vessels, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in retinal vessel segmentation. However, the rotation-and-scale symmetry, as a more widespread image prior in retinal vessels, fails to be characterized by CNNs. Therefore, we propose a rotation-and-scale equivariant Fourier parameterized convolution (RSF-Conv) specifically for retinal vessel segmentation, and provide the corresponding equivariance analysis. As a general module, RSF-Conv can be integrated into existing networks in a plug-and-play manner while significantly reducing the number of parameters. For instance, we replace the traditional convolution filters in U-Net and Iter-Net with RSF-Convs, and faithfully conduct comprehensive experiments. RSF-Conv+U-Net and RSF-Conv+Iter-Net not only have slight advantages under in-domain evaluation, but more importantly, outperform all comparison methods by a significant margin under out-of-domain evaluation. It indicates the remarkable generalization of RSF-Conv, which holds greater practical clinical significance for the prevalent cross-device and cross-hospital challenges in clinical practice. To comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of RSF-Conv, we also apply RSF-Conv+U-Net and RSF-Conv+Iter-Net to retinal artery/vein classification and achieve promising performance as well, indicating its clinical application potential.</description>

      <title>RMT-BVQA: Recurrent Memory Transformer-based Blind Video Quality Assessment for Enhanced Video Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With recent advances in deep learning, numerous algorithms have been developed to enhance video quality, reduce visual artifacts, and improve perceptual quality. However, little research has been reported on the quality assessment of enhanced content - the evaluation of enhancement methods is often based on quality metrics that were designed for compression applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blind deep video quality assessment (VQA) method specifically for enhanced video content. It employs a new Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) based network architecture to obtain video quality representations, which is optimized through a novel content-quality-aware contrastive learning strategy based on a new database containing 13K training patches with enhanced content. The extracted quality representations are then combined through linear regression to generate video-level quality indices. The proposed method, RMT-BVQA, has been evaluated on the VDPVE (VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement) database through a five-fold cross validation. The results show its superior correlation performance when compared to ten existing no-reference quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Condition Video Diffusion Models for single frame Spatial-Semantic Echocardiogram Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional video diffusion models (CDM) have shown promising results for video synthesis, potentially enabling the generation of realistic echocardiograms to address the problem of data scarcity. However, current CDMs require a paired segmentation map and echocardiogram dataset. We present a new method called Free-Echo for generating realistic echocardiograms from a single end-diastolic segmentation map without additional training data. Our method is based on the 3D-Unet with Temporal Attention Layers model and is conditioned on the segmentation map using a training-free conditioning method based on SDEdit. We evaluate our model on two public echocardiogram datasets, CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic. We show that our model can generate plausible echocardiograms that are spatially aligned with the input segmentation map, achieving performance comparable to training-based CDMs. Our work opens up new possibilities for generating echocardiograms from a single segmentation map, which can be used for data augmentation, domain adaptation, and other applications in medical imaging.

      <title>Spatial-frequency Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network for Low-Light Remote Sensing Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-light remote sensing images generally feature high resolution and high spatial complexity, with continuously distributed surface features in space. This continuity in scenes leads to extensive long-range correlations in spatial domains within remote sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely on local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish long-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based methods that focus on global information face high computational complexities when processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another perspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without introducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more efficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range correlations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN) for low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging task of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks: the first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and the second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate information exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion affine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally, we have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the current lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/iijjlk/DFFN.</description>

      <title>LAR-IQA: A Lightweight, Accurate, and Robust No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the field of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using deep learning techniques demonstrate high performance across multiple open-source datasets. However, such models are typically very large and complex making them not so suitable for real-world deployment, especially on resource- and battery-constrained mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose a compact, lightweight NR-IQA model that achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ECCV AIM UHD-IQA challenge validation and test datasets while being also nearly 5.7 times faster than the fastest SOTA model. Our model features a dual-branch architecture, with each branch separately trained on synthetically and authentically distorted images which enhances the model's generalizability across different distortion types. To improve robustness under diverse real-world visual conditions, we additionally incorporate multiple color spaces during the training process. We also demonstrate the higher accuracy of recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for final quality regression as compared to the conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our evaluation considering various open-source datasets highlights the practical, high-accuracy, and robust performance of our proposed lightweight model.
