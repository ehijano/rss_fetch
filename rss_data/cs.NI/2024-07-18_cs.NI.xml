      <title>A UAV-assisted Wireless Localization Challenge on AERPAW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless researchers are tasked to enable wireless communication as infrastructure in more dynamic aerial settings, there is a growing need for large-scale experimental platforms that provide realistic, reproducible, and reliable experimental validation. To bridge the research-to-implementation gap, the Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) offers open-source tools, reference experiments, and hardware to facilitate and evaluate the development of wireless research in controlled digital twin environments and live testbed flights. The inaugural AERPAW Challenge, "Find a Rover," was issued to spark collaborative efforts and test the platform's capabilities. The task involved localizing a narrowband wireless signal, with teams given ten minutes to find the "rover" within a twenty-acre area. By engaging in this exercise, researchers can validate the platform's value as a tool for innovation in wireless communications research within aerial robotics. This paper recounts the methods and experiences of the top three teams in automating and rapidly locating a wireless signal by automating and controlling an aerial drone in a realistic testbed scenario.</description>

      <title>Narrowband, Fast, and Autonomous Drone Radio Mapping for Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how a flying drone can autonomously navigate while constructing a narrowband radio map for signal localization. As flying drones become more ubiquitous, their wireless signals will necessitate new wireless technologies and algorithms to provide robust radio infrastructure while preserving radio spectrum usage. A potential solution for this spectrum-sharing localization challenge is to limit the bandwidth of any transmitter beacon. However, location signaling with a narrow bandwidth necessitates improving a wireless aerial system's ability to filter a noisy signal, estimate the transmitter's location, and self-pilot toward the beacon signal. By showing results through simulation, emulation, and a final drone flight experiment, this work provides an algorithm using a Gaussian process for radio signal estimation and Bayesian optimization for drone automatic guidance. This research supports advanced radio and aerial robotics applications in critical areas such as search-and-rescue, last-mile delivery, and large-scale platform digital twin development.</description>

      <title>Plausibly Deniable Content Discovery for Bitswap Using Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitswap is the data exchange protocol for the content-addressed peer-to-peer overlay network IPFS. During content discovery, Bitswap reveals the interest of a peer in content to all neighbors, enabling the tracking of user interests. In our paper, we propose a modification of the Bitswap protocol, which enables source obfuscation using proxies for content discovery. The proxies are selected via a random-walk. Enabling content discovery through proxies introduces plausible deniability. We evaluate the protocol modification with a simulation. The protocol modification demonstrates enhanced privacy, while maintaining acceptable performance levels.</description>

      <title>A Scheduler for Real-Time Service in Wi-Fi 8 Multi-AP Networks With Parameterized Spatial Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time applications (RTAs) require low delays and impose a significant challenge to Wi-Fi. In Wi-Fi, high delays are often caused by waiting for the channel to become idle. This problem can be solved with Parameterized Spatial Reuse (PSR), which allows a station (STA) to transmit its frame with reduced power simultaneously with a triggered uplink transmission in an overlapping network. The PSR opportunity depends on the pathloss between involved STAs, so the same transmission may allow PSR for one STA but not for another one. Thus, to satisfy tight delay constraints in dense overlapping networks, access points (APs) in the same area shall often allow PSR for every STA with RTA traffic. This letter proposes a fast scheduler enabling frequent PSR transmissions for RTA traffic. The scheduler uses Multi-AP coordination, the feature of upcoming Wi-Fi 8. With simulations, we show that it almost halves the delay for RTA traffic and does not deteriorate the quality of service for other traffic compared with an airtime fairness scheduler.</description>

      <title>Digital Twinning of a Pressurized Water Reactor Startup Operation and Partial Computational Offloading in In-network Computing-Assisted Multiaccess Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of representing complex human action (HA) in a nuclear power plant (NPP) digital twin (DT) and minimizing latency in partial computation offloading (PCO) in sixth-generation-enabled computing in the network (COIN) assisted multiaccess edge computing (MEC). Accurate HA representation in the DT-HA model is vital for modeling human interventions that are crucial for the safe and efficient operation of NPPs. In this context, DT-enabled COIN-assisted MEC harnesses DT (known as a cybertwin) capabilities to optimize resource allocation and reduce latency effectively. A two-stage approach is employed to address system complexity. First, a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) is introduced to capture HAs in the DT abstraction. In the PGM, HA and NPP asset-twin abstractions form coupled systems that evolve and interact through observable data and control input. Next, the underlying PCO problem is formulated as a multiuser game, where NPP assets can partially offload tasks to COIN and MEC. We propose a decentralized algorithm to optimize offloading decisions, offloading ratios, and resource allocation. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing complex HAs and optimal resource allocation in DT-enabled NPPs.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Low-Carbon Artificial Intelligence of Things with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has revolutionized many fields. However, AIoT is facing the challenges of energy consumption and carbon emissions due to the continuous advancement of mobile technology. Fortunately, Generative AI (GAI) holds immense potential to reduce carbon emissions of AIoT due to its excellent reasoning and generation capabilities. In this article, we explore the potential of GAI for carbon emissions reduction and propose a novel GAI-enabled solution for low-carbon AIoT. Specifically, we first study the main impacts that cause carbon emissions in AIoT, and then introduce GAI techniques and their relations to carbon emissions. We then explore the application prospects of GAI in low-carbon AIoT, focusing on how GAI can reduce carbon emissions of network components. Subsequently, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled carbon emission optimization framework, in which we design pluggable LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) modules to generate more accurate and reliable optimization problems. Furthermore, we utilize Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) to identify optimal strategies for carbon emission reduction. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we insightfully provide open research directions for low-carbon AIoT.</description>

      <title>Waste Factor and Waste Figure: A Unified Theory for Modeling and Analyzing Wasted Power in Radio Access Networks for Improved Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Waste Factor (W), also denoted as Waste Figure (WF) in dB, a promising new metric for quantifying energy efficiency in a wide range of circuits and systems applications, including data centers and RANs. Also, the networks used to connect data centers and AI computing engines with users for ML applications must become more power efficient. This paper illustrates the limitations of existing energy efficiency metrics that inadequately capture the intricate energy dynamics of RAN components. We delineate the methodology for applying W across various network configurations, including MISO, SIMO, and MIMO systems, and demonstrate the effectiveness of W in identifying energy optimization opportunities. Our findings reveal that W not only offers nuanced insights into the energy performance of RANs but also facilitates informed decision-making for network design and operational efficiency. Furthermore, we show how W can be integrated with other KPIs to guide the development of optimal strategies for enhancing network energy efficiency under different operational conditions. Additionally, we present simulation results for a distributed multi-user MIMO system at 3.5, 17, and 28 GHz, demonstrating overall network power efficiency on a per square kilometer basis, and show how overall W decreases with an increasing number of base stations and increasing carrier frequency. This paper shows that adopting W as a figure of merit can significantly contribute to the sustainability and energy optimization of next-generation wireless communication networks, paving the way for greener and more sustainable, energy-efficient 5G and 6G technologies.</description>

      <title>Cost and Power-Consumption Analysis for Power Profile Monitoring with Multiple Monitors per Link in Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network monitoring is essential to collect compre-hensive data on signal quality in optical networks. As deploying large amounts of monitoring equipment results in elevated cost and power consumption, novel low-cost monitoring methods are continuously being investigated. A new technique called Power Profile Monitoring (PPM) has recently gained traction thanks to its ability to monitor an entire lightpath using a single post-processing unit at the lightpath receiver. PPM does not require to deploy an individual monitor for each span, as in the traditional monitoring technique using Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer (OTDR). PPM and OTDR have different monitoring applications, which will be elaborated in our discussion, hence they can be considered either alternative or complementary techniques according to the targeted monitoring capabilities to be implemented in the network. In this work, we aim to quantify the cost and power consumption of PPM (using OTDR as a baseline reference), as this analysis can provide guidelines for the implementation and deployment of PPM. First, we discuss how PPM and OTDR monitors are deployed, and we formally state a new Optimized Monitoring Placement (OMP) problem for PPM. Solving the OMP problem allows to identify the minimum number of PPM monitors that guarantees that all links in the networks are monitored by at least n PPM monitors (note that using n &gt; 1 allows for increased monitoring accuracy). We prove the NP-hardness of the OMP problem and formulate it using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model. Finally, we also devise a heuristic algorithm for the OMP problem to scale to larger topologies. Our numerical results, obtained on realistic topologies, suggest that the cost (power) of one PPM module should be lower than 2.6 times and 10.2 times that of one OTDR for nation-wide and continental-wide topology, respectively.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks: A Technical Review of Recent Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent technological advancements in space, air, and ground components have made possible a new network paradigm called space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a key role in SAGINs. However, due to UAVs' high dynamics and complexity, real-world deployment of a SAGIN becomes a significant barrier to realizing such SAGINs. UAVs are expected to meet key performance requirements with limited maneuverability and resources with space and terrestrial components. Therefore, employing UAVs in various usage scenarios requires well-designed planning in algorithmic approaches. This paper provides an essential review and analysis of recent learning algorithms in a UAV-assisted SAGIN. We consider possible reward functions and discuss the state-of-the-art algorithms for optimizing the reward functions, including Q-learning, deep Q-learning, multi-armed bandit, particle swarm optimization, and satisfaction-based learning algorithms. Unlike other survey papers, we focus on the methodological perspective of the optimization problem, applicable to various missions on a SAGIN. We consider real-world configurations and the 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories to reflect deployment cases. Our simulations suggest the 3D satisfaction-based learning algorithm outperforms other approaches in most cases. With open challenges discussed at the end, we aim to provide design and deployment guidelines for UAV-assisted SAGINs.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Simulation Framework to Enable Digital Twin-based V2X Communications in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for physical wireless environments have been recently proposed as accurate virtual representations of the propagation environment that can enable multi-layer decisions at the physical communication equipment. At high-frequency bands, DTs can help to overcome the challenges emerging in high mobility conditions featuring vehicular environments. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven workflow for the creation of the DT of a Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication scenario and a multi-modal simulation framework for the generation of realistic sensor data and accurate mmWave/sub-THz wireless channels. The proposed method leverages an automotive simulation and testing framework and an accurate ray-tracing channel simulator. Simulations over an urban scenario show the achievable realistic sensor and channel modelling both at the infrastructure and at ego-vehicles. We showcase the proposed framework on the DT-aided blockage handover task for V2X link restoration, leveraging the framework's dynamic channel generation capabilities for realistic vehicular blockage simulation.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model for Opinion Dynamics on Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A signed graph offers richer information than an unsigned graph, since it describes both collaborative and competitive relationships in social networks. In this paper, we study opinion dynamics on a signed graph, based on the Friedkin-Johnsen model. We first interpret the equilibrium opinion in terms of a defined random walk on an augmented signed graph, by representing the equilibrium opinion of every node as a combination of all nodes' internal opinions, with the coefficient of the internal opinion for each node being the difference of two absorbing probabilities. We then quantify some relevant social phenomena and express them in terms of the $\ell_2$ norms of vectors. We also design a nearly-linear time signed Laplacian solver for assessing these quantities, by establishing a connection between the absorbing probability of random walks on a signed graph and that on an associated unsigned graph. We further study the opinion optimization problem by changing the initial opinions of a fixed number of nodes, which can be optimally solved in cubic time. We provide a nearly-linear time algorithm with error guarantee to approximately solve the problem. Finally, we execute extensive experiments on sixteen real-life signed networks, which show that both of our algorithms are effective and efficient, and are scalable to massive graphs with over 20 million nodes.</description>
