      <title>Intelligent Green Efficiency for Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged in popularity recently, recording great progress in various industries. However, the environmental impact of AI is a growing concern, in terms of the energy consumption and carbon footprint of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, making essential investigate Green AI, an attempt to reduce the climate impact of AI systems. This paper presents an assessment of different programming languages and Feature Selection (FS) methods to improve computation performance of AI focusing on Network Intrusion Detection (NID) and cyber-attack classification tasks. Experiments were conducted using five ML models - Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory - implemented in four programming languages - Python, Java, R, and Rust - along with three FS methods - Information Gain, Recursive Feature Elimination, and Chi-Square. The obtained results demonstrated that FS plays an important role enhancing the computational efficiency of AI models without compromising detection accuracy, highlighting languages like Python and R, that benefit from a rich AI libraries environment. These conclusions can be useful to design efficient and sustainable AI systems that still provide a good generalization and a reliable detection.</description>

      <title>SCORE: Syntactic Code Representations for Static Script Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As businesses increasingly adopt cloud technologies, they also need to be aware of new security challenges, such as server-side script attacks, to ensure the integrity of their systems and data. These scripts can steal data, compromise credentials, and disrupt operations. Unlike executables with standardized formats (e.g., ELF, PE), scripts are plaintext files with diverse syntax, making them harder to detect using traditional methods. As a result, more sophisticated approaches are needed to protect cloud infrastructures from these evolving threats. In this paper, we propose novel feature extraction and deep learning (DL)-based approaches for static script malware detection, targeting server-side threats. We extract features from plain-text code using two techniques: syntactic code highlighting (SCH) and abstract syntax tree (AST) construction. SCH leverages complex regexes to parse syntactic elements of code, such as keywords, variable names, etc. ASTs generate a hierarchical representation of a program's syntactic structure. We then propose a sequential and a graph-based model that exploits these feature representations to detect script malware. We evaluate our approach on more than 400K server-side scripts in Bash, Python and Perl. We use a balanced dataset of 90K scripts for training, validation, and testing, with the remaining from 400K reserved for further analysis. Experiments show that our method achieves a true positive rate (TPR) up to 81% higher than leading signature-based antivirus solutions, while maintaining a low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.17%. Moreover, our approach outperforms various neural network-based detectors, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning code maliciousness for accurate detection of script malware.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Synthetic Command Attacks on Smart Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in voice synthesis, coupled with the ease with which speech can be harvested for millions of people, introduce new threats to applications that are enabled by devices such as voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home etc.). We explore if unrelated and limited amount of speech from a target can be used to synthesize commands for a voice assistant like Amazon Alexa. More specifically, we investigate attacks on voice assistants with synthetic commands when they match command sources to authorized users, and applications (e.g., Alexa Skills) process commands only when their source is an authorized user with a chosen confidence level. We demonstrate that even simple concatenative speech synthesis can be used by an attacker to command voice assistants to perform sensitive operations. We also show that such attacks, when launched by exploiting compromised devices in the vicinity of voice assistants, can have relatively small host and network footprint. Our results demonstrate the need for better defenses against synthetic malicious commands that could target voice assistants.</description>

      <title>MultiKG: Multi-Source Threat Intelligence Aggregation for High-Quality Knowledge Graph Representation of Attack Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of attack technique knowledge graphs aims to transform various types of attack knowledge into structured representations for more effective attack procedure modeling. Existing methods typically rely on textual data, such as Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports, which are often coarse-grained and unstructured, resulting in incomplete and inaccurate knowledge graphs. To address these issues, we expand attack knowledge sources by incorporating audit logs and static code analysis alongside CTI reports, providing finer-grained data for constructing attack technique knowledge graphs.
  We propose MultiKG, a fully automated framework that integrates multiple threat knowledge sources. MultiKG processes data from CTI reports, dynamic logs, and static code separately, then merges them into a unified attack knowledge graph. Through system design and the utilization of the Large Language Model (LLM), MultiKG automates the analysis, construction, and merging of attack graphs across these sources, producing a fine-grained, multi-source attack knowledge graph.
  We implemented MultiKG and evaluated it using 1,015 real attack techniques and 9,006 attack intelligence entries from CTI reports. Results show that MultiKG effectively extracts attack knowledge graphs from diverse sources and aggregates them into accurate, comprehensive representations. Through case studies, we demonstrate that our approach directly benefits security tasks such as attack reconstruction and detection.</description>

      <title>The VLLM Safety Paradox: Dual Ease in Jailbreak Attack and Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to jailbreak attacks appears as no surprise. However, recent defense mechanisms against these attacks have reached near-saturation performance on benchmarks, often with minimal effort. This simultaneous high performance in both attack and defense presents a perplexing paradox. Resolving it is critical for advancing the development of trustworthy models. To address this research gap, we first investigate why VLLMs are prone to these attacks. We then make a key observation: existing defense mechanisms suffer from an \textbf{over-prudence} problem, resulting in unexpected abstention even in the presence of benign inputs. Additionally, we find that the two representative evaluation methods for jailbreak often exhibit chance agreement. This limitation makes it potentially misleading when evaluating attack strategies or defense mechanisms. Beyond these empirical observations, our another contribution in this work is to repurpose the guardrails of LLMs on the shelf, as an effective alternative detector prior to VLLM response. We believe these findings offer useful insights to rethink the foundational development of VLLM safety with respect to benchmark datasets, evaluation methods, and defense strategies.</description>

      <title>A Fully Local Last-Generated Rule in a Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective method for suppressing intentional forks in a blockchain is the last-generated rule, which selects the most recent chain as the main chain in the event of a chain tie. This rule helps invalidate blocks that are withheld by adversaries for a certain period. However, existing last-generated rules face an issue in that their applications to the system are not fully localized. In conservative cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin, it is desirable for methods to be applied in a fully local manner. In this paper, we propose a locally applicable last-generated rule. Our method is straightforward and is based on a relative time reference. By conservatively setting the upper bound for the clock skews $\Delta_{O_i}$ to 200 s, our proposed method reduces the proportion $\gamma$ of honest miners following the attacker during chain ties by more than 40% compared to existing local methods.</description>

      <title>Trap-MID: Trapdoor-based Defense against Model Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant threat to the privacy of Deep Neural Networks by recovering training data distribution from well-trained models. While existing defenses often rely on regularization techniques to reduce information leakage, they remain vulnerable to recent attacks. In this paper, we propose the Trapdoor-based Model Inversion Defense (Trap-MID) to mislead MI attacks. A trapdoor is integrated into the model to predict a specific label when the input is injected with the corresponding trigger. Consequently, this trapdoor information serves as the "shortcut" for MI attacks, leading them to extract trapdoor triggers rather than private data. We provide theoretical insights into the impacts of trapdoor's effectiveness and naturalness on deceiving MI attacks. In addition, empirical experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art defense performance of Trap-MID against various MI attacks without the requirements for extra data or large computational overhead. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ntuaislab/Trap-MID.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure Intelligent O-RAN Architecture: Vulnerabilities, Threats and Promising Technical Solutions using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems will be fundamentally impacted by an open radio access network (O-RAN), a new concept defining an intelligent architecture with enhanced flexibility, openness, and the ability to slice services more efficiently. For all its promises, and like any technological advancement, O-RAN is not without risks that need to be carefully assessed and properly addressed to accelerate its wide adoption in future mobile networks. In this paper, we present an in-depth security analysis of the O-RAN architecture, discussing the potential threats that may arise in the different O-RAN architecture layers and their impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad. We also promote the potential of zero trust, Moving Target Defense (MTD), blockchain, and large language models(LLM) technologies in fortifying O-RAN's security posture. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of MTD in empowering robust deep reinforcement learning methods for dynamic network slice admission control in the O-RAN architecture. Moreover, we examine the effect of explainable AI (XAI) based on LLMs in securing the system.</description>

      <title>SoK: Towards a Common Understanding of Cryptographic Agility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptographic agility is gaining attention due to its crucial role in maintaining cryptographic security in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. However, despite its increasing importance, the term cryptographic agility remains vaguely defined and there is no clear consensus on its exact meaning. This lack of clarity poses a challenge since the need for agility becomes more urgent as new cryptographic vulnerabilities and advanced computing threats emerge, emphasizing the need for a systematic approach to clarify and refine the notion on cryptographic agility.
  In this paper, we systematize the concept of cryptographic agility by providing three research contributions. First, we review current definitions across academic and gray literature, identifying six distinct categories to differentiate every aspect within the definitions. Second, we synthesize these insights to establish a comprehensive, canonical definition of cryptographic agility. Third, we explore the relationship between cryptographic agility and the related concepts cryptographic versatility and interoperability. In our discussion, we examine the relevance of cryptographic agility, highlight its trade-offs with complexity, assess its individual applicability, and illustrate its various contexts by offering an additional application-specific definition. Our work provides a new perspective on cryptographic agility and related concepts, based on systematical research to clarify and enhance its future use.</description>

      <title>Safety case template for frontier AI: A cyber inability argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) systems pose increasing risks to society, making it essential for developers to provide assurances about their safety. One approach to offering such assurances is through a safety case: a structured, evidence-based argument aimed at demonstrating why the risk associated with a safety-critical system is acceptable. In this article, we propose a safety case template for offensive cyber capabilities. We illustrate how developers could argue that a model does not have capabilities posing unacceptable cyber risks by breaking down the main claim into progressively specific sub-claims, each supported by evidence. In our template, we identify a number of risk models, derive proxy tasks from the risk models, define evaluation settings for the proxy tasks, and connect those with evaluation results. Elements of current frontier safety techniques - such as risk models, proxy tasks, and capability evaluations - use implicit arguments for overall system safety. This safety case template integrates these elements using the Claims Arguments Evidence (CAE) framework in order to make safety arguments coherent and explicit. While uncertainties around the specifics remain, this template serves as a proof of concept, aiming to foster discussion on AI safety cases and advance AI assurance.</description>

      <title>Impactful Bit-Flip Search on Full-precision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, yet they remain susceptible to subtle changes in their input or model parameters. One particularly impactful vulnerability arises through the Bit-Flip Attack (BFA), where flipping a small number of critical bits in a model's parameters can severely degrade its performance. A common technique for inducing bit flips in DRAM is the Row-Hammer attack, which exploits frequent uncached memory accesses to alter data. Identifying susceptible bits can be achieved through exhaustive search or progressive layer-by-layer analysis, especially in quantized networks. In this work, we introduce Impactful Bit-Flip Search (IBS), a novel method for efficiently pinpointing and flipping critical bits in full-precision networks. Additionally, we propose a Weight-Stealth technique that strategically modifies the model's parameters in a way that maintains the float values within the original distribution, thereby bypassing simple range checks often used in tamper detection.</description>

      <title>LLMStinger: Jailbreaking LLMs using RL fine-tuned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLMStinger, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate adversarial suffixes for jailbreak attacks. Unlike traditional methods, which require complex prompt engineering or white-box access, LLMStinger uses a reinforcement learning (RL) loop to fine-tune an attacker LLM, generating new suffixes based on existing attacks for harmful questions from the HarmBench benchmark. Our method significantly outperforms existing red-teaming approaches (we compared against 15 of the latest methods), achieving a +57.2% improvement in Attack Success Rate (ASR) on LLaMA2-7B-chat and a +50.3% ASR increase on Claude 2, both models known for their extensive safety measures. Additionally, we achieved a 94.97% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 99.4% on Gemma-2B-it, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of LLMStinger across open and closed-source models.</description>

      <title>ADI: Adversarial Dominating Inputs in Vertical Federated Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) system has recently become prominent as a concept to process data distributed across many individual sources without the need to centralize it. Multiple participants collaboratively train models based on their local data in a privacy-aware manner. To date, VFL has become a de facto solution to securely learn a model among organizations, allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising privacy of any individuals. Despite the prosperous development of VFL systems, we find that certain inputs of a participant, named adversarial dominating inputs (ADIs), can dominate the joint inference towards the direction of the adversary's will and force other (victim) participants to make negligible contributions, losing rewards that are usually offered regarding the importance of their contributions in federated learning scenarios. We conduct a systematic study on ADIs by first proving their existence in typical VFL systems. We then propose gradient-based methods to synthesize ADIs of various formats and exploit common VFL systems. We further launch greybox fuzz testing, guided by the saliency score of ``victim'' participants, to perturb adversary-controlled inputs and systematically explore the VFL attack surface in a privacy-preserving manner. We conduct an in-depth study on the influence of critical parameters and settings in synthesizing ADIs. Our study reveals new VFL attack opportunities, promoting the identification of unknown threats before breaches and building more secure VFL systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy Guarantees for Personal Mobility Data in Humanitarian Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personal mobility data from mobile phones and other sensors are increasingly used to inform policymaking during pandemics, natural disasters, and other humanitarian crises. However, even aggregated mobility traces can reveal private information about individual movements to potentially malicious actors. This paper develops and tests an approach for releasing private mobility data, which provides formal guarantees over the privacy of the underlying subjects. Specifically, we (1) introduce an algorithm for constructing differentially private mobility matrices, and derive privacy and accuracy bounds on this algorithm; (2) use real-world data from mobile phone operators in Afghanistan and Rwanda to show how this algorithm can enable the use of private mobility data in two high-stakes policy decisions: pandemic response and the distribution of humanitarian aid; and (3) discuss practical decisions that need to be made when implementing this approach, such as how to optimally balance privacy and accuracy. Taken together, these results can help enable the responsible use of private mobility data in humanitarian response.</description>

Abstract: Advances in generative models have made it possible for AI-generated text, code, and images to mirror human-generated content in many applications. Watermarking, a technique that aims to embed information in the output of a model to verify its source, is useful for mitigating the misuse of such AI-generated content. However, we show that common design choices in LLM watermarking schemes make the resulting systems surprisingly susceptible to attack -- leading to fundamental trade-offs in robustness, utility, and usability. To navigate these trade-offs, we rigorously study a set of simple yet effective attacks on common watermarking systems, and propose guidelines and defenses for LLM watermarking in practice.</description>

      <title>FoC: Figure out the Cryptographic Functions in Stripped Binaries with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18403</link>

Abstract: Analyzing the behavior of cryptographic functions in stripped binaries is a challenging but essential task. Cryptographic algorithms exhibit greater logical complexity compared to typical code, yet their analysis is unavoidable in areas such as virus analysis and legacy code inspection. Existing methods often rely on data or structural pattern matching, leading to suboptimal generalizability and suffering from manual work. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FoC to Figure out the Cryptographic functions in stripped binaries. In FoC, we first build a binary large language model (FoC-BinLLM) to summarize the semantics of cryptographic functions in natural language. The prediction of FoC-BinLLM is insensitive to minor changes, such as vulnerability patches. To mitigate it, we further build a binary code similarity model (FoC-Sim) upon the FoC-BinLLM to create change-sensitive representations and use it to retrieve similar implementations of unknown cryptographic functions in a database. In addition, we construct a cryptographic binary dataset for evaluation and to facilitate further research in this domain. And an automated method is devised to create semantic labels for extensive binary functions. Evaluation results demonstrate that FoC-BinLLM outperforms ChatGPT by 14.61% on the ROUGE-L score. FoC-Sim outperforms the previous best methods with a 52% higher Recall@1. Furthermore, our method also shows practical ability in virus analysis and 1-day vulnerability detection.</description>

      <title>"No Matter What You Do": Purifying GNN Models via Backdoor Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have exposed that GNNs are vulnerable to several adversarial attacks, among which backdoor attack is one of the toughest. Similar to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), backdoor attacks in GNNs lie in the fact that the attacker modifies a portion of graph data by embedding triggers and enforces the model to learn the trigger feature during the model training process. Despite the massive prior backdoor defense works on DNNs, defending against backdoor attacks in GNNs is largely unexplored, severely hindering the widespread application of GNNs in real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we present GCleaner, the first backdoor mitigation method on GNNs. GCleaner can mitigate the presence of the backdoor logic within backdoored GNNs by reversing the backdoor learning procedure, aiming to restore the model performance to a level similar to that is directly trained on the original clean dataset. To achieve this objective, we ask: How to recover universal and hard backdoor triggers in GNNs? How to unlearn the backdoor trigger feature while maintaining the model performance? We conduct the graph trigger recovery via the explanation method to identify optimal trigger locations, facilitating the search of universal and hard backdoor triggers in the feature space of the backdoored model through maximal similarity. Subsequently, we introduce the backdoor unlearning mechanism, which combines knowledge distillation and gradient-based explainable knowledge for fine-grained backdoor erasure. Extensive experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCleaner can reduce the backdoor attack success rate to 10% with only 1% of clean data, and has almost negligible degradation in model performance, which far outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a comparative analysis of open-source vulnerability scanners for conversational large language models (LLMs). As LLMs become integral to various applications, they also present potential attack surfaces, exposed to security risks such as information leakage and jailbreak attacks. Our study evaluates prominent scanners - Garak, Giskard, PyRIT, and CyberSecEval - that adapt red-teaming practices to expose these vulnerabilities. We detail the distinctive features and practical use of these scanners, outline unifying principles of their design and perform quantitative evaluations to compare them. These evaluations uncover significant reliability issues in detecting successful attacks, highlighting a fundamental gap for future development. Additionally, we contribute a preliminary labelled dataset, which serves as an initial step to bridge this gap. Based on the above, we provide strategic recommendations to assist organizations choose the most suitable scanner for their red-teaming needs, accounting for customizability, test suite comprehensiveness, and industry-specific use cases.</description>

      <title>DM4Steal: Diffusion Model For Link Stealing Attack On Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph has become increasingly integral to the advancement of recommendation systems, particularly with the fast development of graph neural network(GNN). By exploring the virtue of rich node features and link information, GNN is designed to provide personalized and accurate suggestions. Meanwhile, the privacy leakage of GNN in such contexts has also captured special attention. Prior work has revealed that a malicious user can utilize auxiliary knowledge to extract sensitive link data of the target graph, integral to recommendation systems, via the decision made by the target GNN model. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of data used in recommendation system. Though important, previous works on GNN's privacy leakage are still challenged in three aspects, i.e., limited stealing attack scenarios, sub-optimal attack performance, and adaptation against defense. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion model based link stealing attack, named DM4Steal. It differs previous work from three critical aspects. (i) Generality: aiming at six attack scenarios with limited auxiliary knowledge, we propose a novel training strategy for diffusion models so that DM4Steal is transferable to diverse attack scenarios. (ii) Effectiveness: benefiting from the retention of semantic structure in the diffusion model during the training process, DM4Steal is capable to learn the precise topology of the target graph through the GNN decision process. (iii) Adaptation: when GNN is defensive (e.g., DP, Dropout), DM4Steal relies on the stability that comes from sampling the score model multiple times to keep performance degradation to a minimum, thus DM4Steal implements successful adaptive attack on defensive GNN.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Neural Network Inference Service</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized data analysis and pattern recognition, but its resource-intensive training has limited accessibility. Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) simplifies this by enabling users to delegate their data samples to an MLaaS provider and obtain the inference result using a pre-trained model. Despite its convenience, leveraging MLaaS poses significant privacy and reliability concerns to the client. Specifically, sensitive information from the client inquiry data can be leaked to an adversarial MLaaS provider. Meanwhile, the lack of a verifiability guarantee can potentially result in biased inference results or even unfair payment issues. While existing trustworthy machine learning techniques, such as those relying on verifiable computation or secure computation, offer solutions to privacy and reliability concerns, they fall short of simultaneously protecting the privacy of client data and providing provable inference verifiability.
  In this paper, we propose vPIN, a privacy-preserving and verifiable CNN inference scheme that preserves privacy for client data samples while ensuring verifiability for the inference. vPIN makes use of partial homomorphic encryption and commit-and-prove succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge techniques to achieve desirable security properties. In vPIN, we develop various optimization techniques to minimize the proving circuit for homomorphic inference evaluation thereby, improving the efficiency and performance of our technique. We fully implemented and evaluated our vPIN scheme on standard datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10). Our experimental results show that vPIN achieves high efficiency in terms of proving time, verification time, and proof size, while providing client data privacy guarantees and provable verifiability.</description>

      <title>PEaRL: Personalized Privacy of Human-Centric Systems using Early-Exit Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of human-centric systems, personalized privacy solutions are becoming increasingly crucial due to the dynamic nature of human interactions. Traditional static privacy models often fail to meet the diverse and changing privacy needs of users. This paper introduces PEaRL, a system designed to enhance privacy preservation by tailoring its approach to individual behavioral patterns and preferences. While incorporating reinforcement learning (RL) for its adaptability, PEaRL primarily focuses on employing an early-exit strategy that dynamically balances privacy protection and system utility. This approach addresses the challenges posed by the variability and evolution of human behavior, which static privacy models struggle to handle effectively. We evaluate PEaRL in two distinct contexts: Smart Home environments and Virtual Reality (VR) Smart Classrooms. The empirical results demonstrate PEaRL's capability to provide a personalized tradeoff between user privacy and application utility, adapting effectively to individual user preferences. On average, across both systems, PEaRL enhances privacy protection by 31%, with a corresponding utility reduction of 24%.</description>

      <title>AudioMarkBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Audio Watermarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic speech, driven by advancements in text-to-speech models, raises ethical concerns regarding impersonation and disinformation. Audio watermarking offers a promising solution via embedding human-imperceptible watermarks into AI-generated audios. However, the robustness of audio watermarking against common/adversarial perturbations remains understudied. We present AudioMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the robustness of audio watermarking against watermark removal and watermark forgery. AudioMarkBench includes a new dataset created from Common-Voice across languages, biological sexes, and ages, 3 state-of-the-art watermarking methods, and 15 types of perturbations. We benchmark the robustness of these methods against the perturbations in no-box, black-box, and white-box settings. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of current watermarking techniques and emphasize the need for more robust and fair audio watermarking solutions. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/moyangkuo/AudioMarkBench.</description>

      <title>OML: Open, Monetizable, and Loyal AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has steadily improved across a wide range of tasks. However, the development and deployment of AI are almost entirely controlled by a few powerful organizations that are racing to create Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The centralized entities make decisions with little public oversight, shaping the future of humanity, often with unforeseen consequences. In this paper, we propose OML, which stands for Open, Monetizable, and Loyal AI, an approach designed to democratize AI development. OML is realized through an interdisciplinary framework spanning AI, blockchain, and cryptography. We present several ideas for constructing OML using technologies such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), traditional cryptographic primitives like fully homomorphic encryption and functional encryption, obfuscation, and AI-native solutions rooted in the sample complexity and intrinsic hardness of AI tasks. A key innovation of our work is introducing a new scientific field: AI-native cryptography. Unlike conventional cryptography, which focuses on discrete data and binary security guarantees, AI-native cryptography exploits the continuous nature of AI data representations and their low-dimensional manifolds, focusing on improving approximate performance. One core idea is to transform AI attack methods, such as data poisoning, into security tools. This novel approach serves as a foundation for OML 1.0 which uses model fingerprinting to protect the integrity and ownership of AI models. The spirit of OML is to establish a decentralized, open, and transparent platform for AI development, enabling the community to contribute, monetize, and take ownership of AI models. By decentralizing control and ensuring transparency through blockchain technology, OML prevents the concentration of power and provides accountability in AI development that has not been possible before.</description>

      <title>Two Sides of the Same Coin: Large-scale Measurements of Builder and Rollup after EIP-4844</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Web3 is reshaping decentralized ecosystems through innovations like Ethereum. Recently, EIP-4844 is implemented in Ethereum to support its Layer-2 scaling solutions, which introduces a new 128 KB data structure called blob. This upgrade incorporates type-3 transactions with blobs to verify data availability and reduce gas costs for rollups, significantly affecting the strategies of both builders and rollups. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of emerging strategies in builder and rollup markets after EIP-4844, containing hundred million transactions. We find that the efficiency of builder and rollup strategies is interdependent, akin to two sides of the same coin -- both cannot be optimized simultaneously. That is, when builders operate efficiently, rollups tend to overpay in fees, conversely, when rollups optimize their costs, builders may incur losses in inefficient transaction selection. From the side of builders, our results show that 29.48% of these blocks have been constructed inefficiently, which does not produce sufficient profits for builders. Through our evaluation from the side of rollups, we find that over 72.53% of type-3 transactions pay unnecessary fees, leading to notable economic costs of rollups. Our work provides critical insights into optimizing block construction and transaction strategies, advancing the economic efficiency and data scalability of Web3 infrastructures, yet, much like balancing a seesaw, the efficiency of builders and rollups cannot be optimized concurrently.</description>
