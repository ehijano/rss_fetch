      <title>Revisiting Fekete's Lemma, Subadditive and Periodic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an alternative proof of Fekete's Lemma. We demonstrate that for any subadditive sequence, it is possible to construct a subadditive function that exactly interpolates the sequence. Using this result, along with Hille's theorem on subadditive functions, we naturally arrive at Fekete's Lemma. Additionally, we provide an explicit formula for determining the largest subadditive minorant of a given sequence. We explore a sandwich-type result and derive a discrete version of the Hyers-Ulam type stability theorem. For approximately periodic sequences, we offer a decomposition result. In the final section, we propose two characterization theorems for ordinary periodic sequences.</description>

      <title>On the study of the limit cycles for a class of population models with time-varying factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of population models with time-varying factors, represented by one-dimensional piecewise smooth autonomous differential equations.
  We provide several derivative formulas in "discrete" form for the Poincar\'{e} map of such equations, and establish a criterion for the existence of limit cycles.
  These two tools, together with the known ones, are then combined in a preliminary procedure that can provide a simple and unified way to analyze the equations.
  As an application, we prove that a general model of single species with seasonal constant-yield harvesting can only possess at most two limit cycles, which improves the work of Xiao in 2016.
  We also apply our results to a general model described by the Abel equations with periodic step function coefficients, showing that its maximum number of limit cycles, is three.
  Finally, a population suppression model for mosquitos considered by Yu and Li in 2020 and Zheng et al. in 2021 is studied using our approach.</description>

      <title>Note on the Humbert function $\Psi_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Hang and Luo (2024) used an elementary approach to derive the leading asymptotic behavior of the Humbert function $\Psi_1[a,b;c,c';x,y]$ when $x\to\infty$ and $y\to +\infty$. In this paper, we give detailed asymptotic analyses of $\Psi_1$ when $x\to\infty$ and $y\to\infty$. Our proof is based on a uniform estimate of ${}_2F_2[a,b-n;c,d-n;z]$ for $z$ large.</description>

      <title>Positive definite singular kernels on two-point homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positive definiteness of kernels $K(x,y)$ on two-point homogeneous
  spaces. As opposed to the classical case, which has been developed and studied
  in the existing literature, we allow the kernel to have an (integrable)
  singularity for $x=y$. Specifically, the Riesz kernel $d(x,y)^{-s}$ (where
  $d$ denotes some distance on the space) is a prominent example. We derive
  results analogous to Schoenberg's characterization of positive definite
  functions on the sphere, Schur's lemma on the positive definiteness of the
  product of positive definite functions, and Schoenberg's characterization of
  functions positive definite on all spheres. We use these results to better
  understand the behavior of the Riesz kernels for the geodesic and chordal
  distances on projective spaces.</description>

      <title>A Dilogarithm Series and a Generalization of a Theorem of Bridgeman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Abel's five-term relation, we obtain a new two-parameter series identity for the Rogers dilogarithm. By specializing this identity we are able to derive dilogarithm series involving Lucas sequences. These identities generalize some results of Bridgeman, which were obtained using a completely different approach.</description>

      <title>Integer tile and Spectrality of Cantor-Moran measures with equidifferent digit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\left\{b_{k}\right\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of integers with $|b_{k}|\geq2$ and $\left\{D_{k}\right\}_{k=1}^{\infty} $ be a sequence of equidifferent digit sets with $D_{k}=\left\{0,1, \cdots, N-1\right\}t_{k},$ where $N\geq2$ is a prime number and $\{t_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is bounded. In this paper, we study the existence of the Cantor-Moran measure $\mu_{\{b_k\},\{D_k\}}$ and show that $$\mathbf{D}_k:=D_k\oplus b_{k} D_{k-1}\oplus b_{k}b_{k-1} D_{k-2}\oplus\cdots\oplus b_{k}b_{k-1}\cdots b_2D_{1}$$ is an integer tile for all $k\in\mathbb{N}^+$ if and only if $\mathbf{s}_i\neq\mathbf{s}_j$ for all $i\neq j\in\mathbb{N}^{+}$, where $\mathbf{s}_i$ is defined as the numbers of factor $N$ in $\frac{b_1b_2\cdots b_i}{Nt_i}$. Moreover, we prove that $\mathbf{D}_k$ being an integer tile for all $k\in\mathbb{N}^+$ is a necessary condition for the Cantor-Moran measure to be a spectral measure, and we provide an example to demonstrate that it cannot become a sufficient condition. Furthermore, under some additional assumptions, we establish that the Cantor-Moran measure to be a spectral measure is equivalent to $\mathbf{D}_k$ being an integer tile for all $k\in\mathbb{N}^+$.</description>

      <title>On weighted Ces\`{a}ro function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive demonstration of recent results regarding the structures of the weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces. These spaces' definitions involve local and global weighted Lebesgue norms; in other words, the norms of these spaces are generated by positive sublinear operators and by weighted Lebesgue norms. The weighted Lebesgue spaces are the special cases of these spaces with a specific set of parameters.
  Our primary method of investigating these spaces will be the so-called discretization technique. Our technique will be the development of the approach initiated by K.G. Grosse-Erdmann, which allows us to obtain the characterization in previously unavailable situations, thereby addressing decades-old open problems.
  We investigate the relation (embeddings) between weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces. The characterization of these embeddings can be used to tackle the problems of characterizing pointwise multipliers between weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces, the characterizations of the associate spaces of Ces\`aro (Copson) function spaces, as well as the relations between local Morrey-type spaces.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness in the critical regularity setting for hyperbolic systems with partial diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the local existence theory of the Cauchy problem for a general class of symmetrizable hyperbolic partially diffusive systems (also called hyperbolic-parabolic systems) in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\ge 1$. We address the question of well-posedness for large data having critical Besov regularity in the spirit of previous works by the second author on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to the pioneering of Kawashima (S. Kawashima. Systems of a hyperbolic parabolic type with applications to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. PhD thesis, Kyoto University, 1983) and to the more recent work by Serre (D. Serre. Local existence for viscous system of conservation laws: $H^s$-data with $s &gt; 1+d/2$. In Nonlinear partial differential equations and hyperbolic wave phenomena, volume 526 of Contemp. Math., pages 339-358. Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2010), we take advantage of the partial parabolicity of the system to consider data in functional spaces that need not be embedded in the set of Lipschitz functions. This is in sharp contrast with the classical well-posedness theory of (multi-dimensional) hyperbolic systems where it is mandatory. A leitmotiv of our analysis is to require less regularity for the components experiencing a direct diffusion, than for the hyperbolic components. We then use an energy method that is performed on the system after spectral localization and a suitable G\r{a}rding inequality. As an example, we consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations.</description>
