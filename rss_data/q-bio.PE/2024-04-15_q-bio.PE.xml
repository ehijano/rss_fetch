      <title>Prevalence estimation methods for time-dependent antibody kinetics of infected and vaccinated individuals: a graph-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immune events such as infection, vaccination, and a combination of the two result in distinct time-dependent antibody responses in affected individuals. These responses and event prevalences combine non-trivially to govern antibody levels sampled from a population. Time-dependence and disease prevalence pose considerable modeling challenges that need to be addressed to provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning of the underlying biology. We propose a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for anti-body kinetics and demonstrate its use in a setting in which individuals can be infected or vaccinated but not both. We prove the equivalency of this approach to the framework developed in our previous work. Synthetic data are used to demonstrate the modeling process and conduct prevalence estimation via transition probability matrices. This approach is ideal to model sequences of infections and vaccinations, or personal trajectories in a population, making it an important first step towards a mathematical characterization of reinfection, vaccination boosting, and cross-events of infection after vaccination or vice versa.</description>

      <title>A biological circuit to anticipate trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms gain by anticipating future changes in the environment. Those environmental changes often follow stochastic trends. The greater the slope of the trend, the more likely the trend's momentum carries the future trend in the same direction. This article presents a simple biological circuit that measures the momentum, providing a prediction about future trend. The circuit calculates the momentum by the difference between a short-term and a long-term exponential moving average. The time lengths of the two moving averages can be adjusted by changing the decay rates of state variables. Different time lengths for those averages trade off between errors caused by noise and errors caused by lags in predicting a change in the direction of the trend. Prior studies have emphasized circuits that make similar calculations about trends. However, those prior studies embedded their analyses in the details of particular applications, obscuring the simple generality and wide applicability of the approach. The model here contributes to the topic by clarifying the great simplicity and generality of anticipation for stochastic trends. This article also notes that, in financial analysis, the difference between moving averages is widely used to predict future trends in asset prices. The financial measure is called the moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) indicator. Connecting the biological problem to financial analysis opens the way for future studies in biology to exploit the variety of highly developed trend models in finance.</description>

      <title>Solving the Tree Containment Problem Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree Containment is a fundamental problem in phylogenetics useful for verifying a proposed phylogenetic network, representing the evolutionary history of certain species. Tree Containment asks whether the given phylogenetic tree (for instance, constructed from a DNA fragment showing tree-like evolution) is contained in the given phylogenetic network. In the general case, this is an NP-complete problem. We propose to solve it approximately using Graph Neural Networks. In particular, we propose to combine the given network and the tree and apply a Graph Neural Network to this network-tree graph. This way, we achieve the capability of solving the tree containment instances representing a larger number of species than the instances contained in the training dataset (i.e., our algorithm has the inductive learning ability). Our algorithm demonstrates an accuracy of over $95\%$ in solving the tree containment problem on instances with up to 100 leaves.</description>

      <title>Spatially disordered environments stabilize competitive metacommunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metapopulation models have been instrumental in demonstrating the ecological impact of landscape structure on the survival of a focal species in complex environments. However, extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions limiting their scope. Here, we develop a multilayer network model of competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how spatially structured environments impact species coexistence and ecosystem stability. We show that homogeneous environments always lead to monodominance unless all species' fitness parameters are in an exact trade-off. However, this precise fine-tuning does not guarantee coexistence in generic heterogeneous environments. By introducing general spatial disorder in the model, we solve it exactly in the mean-field limit, finding that stable coexistence becomes possible in the presence of strong disorder. Crucially, coexistence is supported by the spontaneous localization of species through the emergence of ecological niches. Our results remain qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where topological features can improve species coexistence. Finally, we employ our model to study how correlated disorder promotes spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and riverine landscapes. Our work provides a novel framework to understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in metacommunities by acting as the substrate for ecological interactions.</description>

      <title>Bounding seed loss from isolated habitat patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersal of propagules (seeds, spores) from a geographically isolated population into an uninhabitable matrix can threaten population persistence if it prevents new growth from keeping pace with mortality. Quantifying propagule loss can thus inform restoration and conservation of vulnerable populations in fragmented landscapes. To model propagule loss in detail, one can integrate dispersal kernels (probabilistic descriptions of dispersal) and plant densities. However, one might lack the detailed spatial information and computational tools needed by such integral models. Here we derive two upper bounds on the probability of propagule loss--one assuming rotational symmetry of dispersal and the other not--that require only habitat area, habitat perimeter, and the mean dispersal distance of a propagule. We compare the bounds to simulations of integral models for the population of Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed) at McKnight Prairie--a 13.7 hectare reserve surrounded by agricultural fields in Goodhue County, Minnesota--and identify conditions under which the bounds closely estimate propagule loss.</description>

      <title>Early detection of disease outbreaks and non-outbreaks using incidence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting the occurrence and absence of novel disease outbreaks is essential for disease management. Here, we develop a general model, with no real-world training data, that accurately forecasts outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We propose a novel framework, using a feature-based time series classification method to forecast outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We tested our methods on synthetic data from a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model for slowly changing, noisy disease dynamics. Outbreak sequences give a transcritical bifurcation within a specified future time window, whereas non-outbreak (null bifurcation) sequences do not. We identified incipient differences in time series of infectives leading to future outbreaks and non-outbreaks. These differences are reflected in 22 statistical features and 5 early warning signal indicators. Classifier performance, given by the area under the receiver-operating curve, ranged from 0.99 for large expanding windows of training data to 0.7 for small rolling windows. Real-world performances of classifiers were tested on two empirical datasets, COVID-19 data from Singapore and SARS data from Hong Kong, with two classifiers exhibiting high accuracy. In summary, we showed that there are statistical features that distinguish outbreak and non-outbreak sequences long before outbreaks occur. We could detect these differences in synthetic and real-world data sets, well before potential outbreaks occur.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Innovation by Polyploidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preferred conditions for evolutionary innovation is a fundamental question, but little is known, in part because the question involves rare events. We focused on the potential role of polyploidy in the evolution of novel traits. There are two hypotheses regarding the effects of polyploidy on evolution: Polyploidy reduces the effect of a single mutation and slows evolution. In contrast, the gene redundancy introduced by polyploidy will promote neofunctionalization and accelerate evolution. Does polyploidy speed up or slow down evolution? In this study, we proposed a simple model of polyploid cells and showed that the evolutionary rate of polyploids is similar to or much slower than that of haploids under neutral selection or during gradual evolution. However, on a fitness landscape where cells should jump over a lethal valley to increase their fitness, the probability of evolution in polyploidy could be drastically increased, and the optimal number of chromosomes was identified. We theoretically discussed the existence of this optimal chromosome number from the large deviation theory. Furthermore, we proposed that the optimization for achieving evolutionary innovation could determine the range of chromosome numbers in polyploid bacteria.</description>

      <title>A novel algebraic approach to time-reversible evolutionary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last years, algebraic tools have been proven useful in phylogenetic reconstruction and model selection through the study of phylogenetic invariants. However, up to now, the models studied from an algebraic viewpoint are either too general or too restrictive (as group-based models with a uniform stationary distribution) to be used in practice.
  In this paper we provide a new framework to study time-reversible models, which are the most widely used by biologists. In our approach we consider algebraic time-reversible models on phylogenetic trees (as defined by Allman and Rhodes) and introduce a new inner product to make all transition matrices of the process diagonalizable through the same orthogonal eigenbasis. This framework generalizes the Fourier transform widely used to work with group-based models and recovers some of the well known results. As illustration, we combine our technique with algebraic geometry tools to provide relevant phylogenetic invariants for trees evolving under the Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution.</description>

      <title>Spirals and heteroclinic cycles in a spatially extended Rock-Paper-Scissors model of cyclic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.04141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially extended versions of the cyclic-dominance Rock-Paper-Scissors model have traveling wave (in one dimension) and spiral (in two dimensions) behavior. The far field of the spirals behave like traveling waves, which themselves have profiles reminiscent of heteroclinic cycles. We compute numerically a nonlinear dispersion relation between the wavelength and wavespeed of the traveling waves, and, together with insight from heteroclinic bifurcation theory and further numerical results from 2D simulations, we are able to make predictions about the overall structure and stability of spiral waves in 2D cyclic dominance models.</description>
