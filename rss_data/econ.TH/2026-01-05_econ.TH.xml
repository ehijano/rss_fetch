      <title>Dynamic Market Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic market design theory is rooted in static models where all participants trade simultaneously. In contrast, modern platform-mediated digital markets are fundamentally dynamic, defined by the asynchronous and stochastic arrival of supply and demand. This chapter surveys recent work that brings market design to this dynamic setting. We focus on a methodological framework that transforms complex dynamic problems into tractable static programs by analyzing the long-run stationary distribution of the system. The survey explores how priority rules and information policy can be designed to clear markets and screen agents when monetary transfers are unavailable, and, when they are available, how queues of participants and goods can be managed to balance intertemporal mismatches of demand and supply and to spread competitive pressures across time.</description>

      <title>The Dial-a-Ride Problem with Synchronized Visits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited capacity of drones and future one- or two-seat modular vehicles requires multiple units to serve a single large customer (i.e., a customer whose demand exceeds a single vehicle's capacity) simultaneously, whereas small customers (i.e., those whose demand can be served by a single vehicle) can be consolidated in one trip. This motivates the Dial-a-Ride Problem with Synchronized Visits, where a fleet of drones must be routed and scheduled to transport orders at minimum cost. We propose four formulations: arc-based, event-based, time-space event-based (TSEF), and time-space fragment-based (TSFrag). An event is defined as a tuple of a location and a set of onboard customers, while a fragment represents a partial path. For TSEF and TSFrag, we also employ the dynamic discretization discovery (DDD) algorithm, which iteratively refines an initial low-resolution time-space network to obtain a continuous-time optimal solution. Computational results show that the event-based formulation performs best under low request intensity (few customers per unit time), whereas TSFrag with DDD excels with high request intensity; both substantially outperform the arc-based formulation. When implemented with DDD, TSFrag also requires less time and fewer iterations than TSEF. We also apply our methods to the classical dial-a-ride problem, where we find that that TSFrag with DDD can replace callbacks in case of high request intensity, and that using DDD is more beneficial to this problem than to the pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows.</description>

      <title>Separating the Wheat from the Chaff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a reputational cheap-talk environment in which a judge, who is privately and imperfectly informed about a state, must choose between two speakers of unknown reliability. Exactly one speaker is an expert who perfectly observes the state, while the other is a quack with no information. Both speakers seek to be selected, while the judge wishes to identify the expert. We show that, quite generally, there is an equilibrium in which the expert is honest, yet the judge favors more extreme signals. This bias toward extremism does not induce exaggeration by the expert, but instead sustains truthful communication. The quack strategically mimics the expert's speech, and sometimes panders to the judge's prior. We show that learning in this environment exhibits an ``information begets information'' property: judges with more precise private information are more likely to identify the expert and learn the true state, implying that exposure to competing sources of uncertain reliability may amplify informational inequality across audiences.</description>

      <title>Learning from Experts with Uncertain Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study social learning from multiple experts whose precision is unknown and who care about reputation. The observer both learns a persistent state and ranks experts. In a binary baseline we characterize per-period equilibria: high types are truthful; low types distort one-sidedly with closed-form mixing around the prior. Aggregation is additive in log-likelihood ratios. Light-touch design -- evaluation windows scored by strictly proper rules or small convex deviation costs -- restores strict informativeness and delivers asymptotic efficiency under design (consistent state learning and reputation identification). A Gaussian extension yields a mimicry coefficient and linear filtering. With common shocks, GLS weights are optimal and correlation slows learning. The framework fits advisory panels, policy committees, and forecasting platforms, and yields transparent comparative statics and testable implications.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Exploitation Equilibria for Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Sustainable Exploitation Equilibrium (SEE), a refinement of Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) for dynamic games with an exploiter-exploitee structure. SEE imposes renegotiation-proof exploiter-optimal selection on the set of rationally viable stationary Markov equilibria, where viability follows from sequential rationality when exiting a sustainability set entails catastrophic losses. Unlike MPE, SEE rules out equilibria in which the exploiter optimally drives the state to collapse despite positive continuation payoffs. The exploitee cannot exit, but retains a strategic effort margin affecting dynamics and payoffs. We establish existence under standard conditions, and the refinement is illustrated in a hegemon-client model of foreign politics.</description>
