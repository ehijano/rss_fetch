      <title>Fuzzy Based Secure Clustering Schemes for Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation presents three independent novel approaches for distinct scenarios to solve one or more open challenges. The first concern explains the focus on the lifetime of the networks: this dissertation will utilize a fuzzy logic-based clustering protocol with multi-hop transmission for load balancing, energy consumption minimization, and network lifetime prolongation. The protocol forms unequal clusters with cluster head (CH) being selected by fuzzy logic with competition radius. Node distance to the base station, concentration, and residual energy are input variables. The second concern focuses on network stability: we design a type 2 fuzzy logic-based clustering schemes in a multi-hop WSN to reduce energy consumption and improve network scalability. In this clustering scheme, we propose a cluster head (CH) selection strategy where a sensor node is elected as a CH based on type 2 fuzzy logic inputs. To balance the load of CHs we also select their radius size based on the fuzzy logic inputs. Finally, the third concern is focus on the utility of game theory in defensive Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) from selfish nodes and malicious behavior. Game theory can effectively model WSNs malicious attacks because of their low complexity and scalability. The study, thus, explores different WSN defense strategies from both external attackers and internal nodes acting selfishly or maliciously using the game theory approach. Also, the chapter highlights the general trust model for decision-making using the game theory framework. Besides, the chapter demonstrates the significance of the theory in ensuring WSN security from acute attacks and its role in enhancing trustworthiness in data and cooperation of nodes in various WSN architectures.</description>

      <title>Structural Resilience Analysis of an Internet Fragment Against Targeted and Random Attacks -- A Case Study Based on iThena Project Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an analysis of the structural resilience of a fragment of Internet topology against both targeted and random attacks, based on empirical data obtained from the iThena project. Using a processed visualization of the network, a graph representing node connections was generated and subsequently subjected to detailed analysis using centrality metrics and community detection algorithms. Two attack scenarios were carried out: removal of nodes with the highest betweenness centrality and random removal of an equivalent number of nodes. The results indicate that targeted attacks have a significantly more destructive impact on the cohesion and functionality of the network than random disruptions. The article highlights the importance of identifying critical nodes and developing monitoring and protection mechanisms for Internet infrastructure in the context of cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Research on Cloud Platform Network Traffic Monitoring and Anomaly Detection System based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly evolving cloud platforms and the escalating complexity of network traffic demand proper network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection to ensure network security and performance. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM)-based network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system. In addition to existing models such as autoencoders and decision trees, we harness the power of large language models for processing sequence data from network traffic, which allows us a better capture of underlying complex patterns, as well as slight fluctuations in the dataset. We show for a given detection task, the need for a hybrid model that incorporates the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture into a supervised learning framework in order to achieve better accuracy. A pre-trained large language model analyzes and predicts the probable network traffic, and an anomaly detection layer that considers temporality and context is added. Moreover, we present a novel transfer learning-based methodology to enhance the model's effectiveness to quickly adapt to unknown network structures and adversarial conditions without requiring extensive labeled datasets. Actual results show that the designed model outperforms traditional methods in detection accuracy and computational efficiency, effectively identify various network anomalies such as zero-day attacks and traffic congestion pattern, and significantly reduce the false positive rate.</description>

      <title>Monero Peer-to-peer Network Topology Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monero, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, employs a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network that plays a critical role in transaction propagation and consensus formation. While much research has explored Monero's privacy transaction mechanisms, its underlying P2P network architecture has remained relatively underexplored. In this study, building on our recent work on Monero network detection, we further investigate the network topology of Monero's P2P structure, which has evolved following recent protocol updates that enhanced security by obscuring peer information. Using k-core decomposition, we confirm that the Monero network exhibits a core-periphery structure, where a tightly interconnected core of supernodes is crucial for maintaining network cohesion, while peripheral nodes rely on these core nodes for connectivity. This structure explains why targeting central nodes does not easily lead to the rapid disintegration of the network's largest connected component while also providing a deeper understanding of the true architecture of Monero's peer protocol.</description>

      <title>Fast Multichannel Topology Discovery in Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), secondary users (SUs) must efficiently discover each other across multiple communication channels while avoiding interference from primary users (PUs). Traditional multichannel rendezvous algorithms primarily focus on enabling pairs of SUs to find common channels without explicitly considering the underlying network topology. In this paper, we extend the rendezvous framework to explicitly incorporate network topology, introducing the \emph{multichannel topology discovery problem}. We propose a novel \emph{pseudo-random sweep algorithm with forward replacement}, designed to minimize correlation between consecutive unsuccessful rendezvous attempts, thereby significantly reducing the expected time-to-discovery (ETTD). Additionally, we introduce a \emph{threshold-based stick-together strategy} that dynamically synchronizes user hopping sequences based on partially known information, further enhancing discovery efficiency. Extensive simulation results validate our theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms substantially outperform conventional (sequential) sweep methods.</description>

      <title>Integrating Explainable AI for Energy Efficient Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is an emerging idea -- transforming the traditional Radio Access Networks (RAN) that are monolithic and inflexible into more flexible and innovative. By leveraging open standard interfaces, data collection across all RAN layers becomes feasible, paving the way for the development of energy-efficient Open RAN architectures through Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML). However, the inherent complexity and black-box nature of AI/ML models used for energy consumption prediction pose challenges in interpreting their underlying factors and relationships. This work presents an integration of eXplainable AI (XAI) to understand the key RAN parameters that contribute to energy consumption. Furthermore, the paper delves into the analysis of RAN parameters -- \emph{airtime}, \emph{goodput}, \emph{throughput}, \emph{buffer status report}, \emph{number of resource blocks}, and many others -- identified by XAI techniques, highlighting their significance in energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Joint Resource Estimation and Trajectory Optimization for eVTOL-involved CR network: A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Open RAN: Empowering Hierarchical RAN Intelligent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a significant interest in deploying LLMempowered algorithms for wireless communication networks. Meanwhile, open radio access network (O-RAN) techniques offer unprecedented flexibility, with the non-real-time (non-RT) radio access network (RAN) intelligent controller (RIC) (non-RT RIC) and near-real-time (near-RT) RIC (near-RT RIC) components enabling intelligent resource management across different time scales. In this paper, we propose the LLM empowered hierarchical RIC (LLM-hRIC) framework to improve the collaboration between RICs. This framework integrates LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient network resource management. In this framework, LLMs-empowered non-RT RICs provide strategic guidance and high-level policies based on environmental context. Concurrently, RL-empowered near-RT RICs perform low-latency tasks based on strategic guidance and local near-RT observation. We evaluate the LLM-hRIC framework in an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network setting. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Finally, we discuss the key future challenges in applying LLMs to O-RAN.</description>

      <title>FlexiNS: A SmartNIC-Centric, Line-Rate and Flexible Network Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the gap between network and CPU speeds rapidly increases, the CPU-centric network stack proves inadequate due to excessive CPU and memory overhead. While hardware-offloaded network stacks alleviate these issues, they suffer from limited flexibility in both control and data planes. Offloading network stack to off-path SmartNIC seems promising to provide high flexibility; however, throughput remains constrained by inherent SmartNIC architectural limitations.
  To this end, we design FlexiNS, a SmartNIC-centric network stack with software transport programmability and line-rate packet processing capabilities. To grapple with the limitation of SmartNIC-induced challenges, FlexiNS introduces: (a) a header-only offloading TX path; (b) an unlimited-working-set in-cache processing RX path; (c) a high-performance DMA-only notification pipe; and (d) a programmable offloading engine. We prototype FlexiNS using Nvidia BlueField-3 SmartNIC and provide out-of-the-box RDMA IBV verbs compatibility to users. FlexiNS achieves 2.2$\times$ higher throughput than the microkernel-based baseline in block storage disaggregation and 1.3$\times$ higher throughput than the hardware-offloaded baseline in KVCache transfer.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Communications for Visual Navigation with Edge-Aerial Collaboration in Low Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To support the Low Altitude Economy (LAE), precise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) localization in urban areas where global positioning system (GPS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based methods offer a viable alternative but face severe bandwidth, memory and processing constraints on lightweight UAVs. Inspired by mammalian spatial cognition, we propose a task-oriented communication framework, where UAVs equipped with multi-camera systems extract compact multi-view features and offload localization tasks to edge servers. We introduce the Orthogonally-constrained Variational Information Bottleneck encoder (O-VIB), which incorporates automatic relevance determination (ARD) to prune non-informative features while enforcing orthogonality to minimize redundancy. This enables efficient and accurate localization with minimal transmission cost. Extensive evaluation on a dedicated LAE UAV dataset shows that O-VIB achieves high-precision localization under stringent bandwidth budgets. Code and dataset will be made publicly available: github.com/fangzr/TOC-Edge-Aerial.</description>

      <title>Information Freshness in Dynamic Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a source that shares updates with a network of $n$ gossiping nodes. The network's topology switches between two arbitrary topologies, with switching governed by a two-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) process. Information freshness is well-understood for static networks. This work evaluates the impact of time-varying connections on information freshness. In order to quantify the freshness of information, we use the version age of information metric. If the two networks have static long-term average version ages of $f_1(n)$ and $f_2(n)$ with $f_1(n) \ll f_2(n)$, then the version age of the varying-topologies network is related to $f_1(n)$, $f_2(n)$, and the transition rates in the CTMC. If the transition rates in the CTMC are faster than $f_1(n)$, the average version age of the varying-topologies network is $f_1(n)$. Further, we observe that the behavior of a vanishingly small fraction of nodes can severely impact the long-term average version age of a network in a negative way. This motivates the definition of a typical set of nodes in the network. We evaluate the impact of fast and slow CTMC transition rates on the typical set of nodes.</description>

      <title>Forensics and security issues in the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the exponential expansion of the internet, the possibilities of security attacks and cybercrimes have increased accordingly. However, poorly implemented security mechanisms in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make them susceptible to cyberattacks, which can directly affect users. IoT forensics is thus needed to investigate and mitigate such attacks. While many works have examined IoT applications and challenges, only a few have focused on both the forensic and security issues in IoT. Therefore, this paper reviews forensic and security issues associated with IoT in different fields. Prospects and challenges in IoT research and development are also highlighted. As the literature demonstrates, most IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of standardized security measures. Unauthorized users could get access, compromise data, and even benefit from control of critical infrastructure. To fulfill the security-conscious needs of consumers, IoT can be used to develop a smart home system by designing the security-conscious needs of consumers; IoT can be used to create a smart home system by designing an IoT can be used to develop a smart home system by designing a FLIP-based system that is highly scalable and adaptable. A blockchain-based authentication mechanism with a multi-chain structure can provide additional security protection between different trust domains. Deep learning can be utilized to develop a network forensics framework with a high-performing system for detecting and tracking cyberattack incidents. Moreover, researchers should consider limiting the amount of data created and delivered when using big data to develop IoT-based smart systems. The findings of this review will stimulate academics to seek potential solutions for the identified issues, thereby advancing the IoT field.</description>

      <title>Virtuoso: High Resource Utilization and {\mu}s-scale Performance Isolation in a Shared Virtual Machine TCP Network Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtualization improves resource efficiency and ensures security and performance isolation for cloud applications. Today, operators use a layered architecture with separate network stack instances in each VM and container connected to a virtual switch. Decoupling through layering reduces complexity, but induces performance and resource overheads at odds with increasing demands for network bandwidth, connection scalability, and low latency.
  We present Virtuoso, a new software network stack for VMs and containers. Virtuoso re-organizes the network stack to maximize CPU utilization, enforce isolation, and minimize processing overheads. We maximize utilization by running one elastically shared network stack instance on dedicated cores; we enforce isolation by performing central and fine-grained per-packet resource accounting and scheduling; we reduce overheads by building a single-layer data path with a one-shot fast-path incorporating all processing from the TCP transport layer through network virtualization and virtual switching. Virtuoso improves resource efficiency by up to 82%, latencies by up to 58% compared to other virtualized network stacks without sacrificing isolation, and keeps processing overhead within 6.7% of unvirtualized stacks.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Performance in Communication Networks Under Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of time-critical applications in modern communication networks, there is a growing demand for proactive network adaptation and quality of service (QoS) prediction. However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: how can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1 queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide deterministic services.</description>

      <title>Improved Contact Graph Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks with Capacity and Buffer Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite communications present challenging characteristics. Continuous end-to-end connectivity may not be available due to the large distances between satellites. Moreover, resources such as link capacity and buffer memory may be limited. Routing in satellite networks is therefore both complex and crucial to avoid packet losses and long delays. The Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) paradigm has emerged as an efficient solution for managing these challenging networks. Contact Graph Routing (CGR), a deterministic routing algorithm, is one of the most popular DTN algorithms. CGR is compatible with the ``store, carry, and forward" principle, whereby a node receives a message and stores it in its buffer until a transmission opportunity becomes available. However, CGR relies on simplified models to incorporate potential constraints in the route search. For instance, the linear volume assumption is often used to consider capacity constraints. Moreover, capacity management and buffer management are mostly performed during the forwarding phase, once an issue has occurred. In this paper, we propose taking measures before or during the route search in order to find routes that respect both contact-capacity and node-buffer limits. We introduce the contact splitting and edge pruning operations to effectively account for the routing constraints. This ensures that CGR outputs the optimal solution among the subset of valid solutions. The proposed approach can also be used to book resources to be used in case of issues during the forwarding phase.</description>

      <title>NetCloak: Dynamic Topology Expansion for Secure and Scalable Configuration Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As modern networks continue to grow in both scale and complexity, sharing real-world device configurations poses significant privacy risks, especially when adversaries can infer organizational size or resource distribution from topology data. We present NetCloak, a configuration anonymization framework that adaptively injects synthetic routers and hosts into the network graph to obfuscate true scale, while preserving end-to-end forwarding behavior. NetCloak core techniques include: (1) a graph-embedding expansion algorithm that integrates the original topology into a larger reference graph, ensuring added nodes blend seamlessly with real ones; (2) a k-degree mapping anonymity scheme that selectively adds minimal links to guarantee each original node degree is indistinguishable among at least k peers; (3) a mimicry-driven configuration generator that derives command templates from existing devices, preserving command ordering, naming conventions, and routing policies; and (4) a layered repair process combining SMT-based intra-AS route synthesis with iterative inter-AS filter insertion to restore protocol-correct routing under OSPF and BGP. Extensive experiments on real and emulated campus and data-center topologies demonstrate that NetCloak effectively conceals network size, improving topological rationality by over 70% and configuration fidelity by nearly 30% compared to baseline methods, while reducing route-repair overhead by more than 50% under randomized link costs. NetCloak thus enables safe, privacy-preserving configuration sharing at scale.</description>

      <title>Assessing SSL/TLS Certificate Centralization: Implications for Digital Sovereignty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SSL/TLS is a fundamental technology in the network protocol stack that enables encrypted data transmission and authentication of web domains. However, the current model relies on a small number of Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide and validate certificates, thus creating a highly centralized ecosystem. In this paper, we analyze the degree of centralization of certificate provisioning from CAs in two major political groups: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) and the European Union (EU). We have found that over 75% of certificates for both BRICS and EU domains originate from CAs based in the United States, indicating possible risks to their digital sovereignty due to the high level of external dependency. This indicates the need for nations within those groups to research alternatives to reduce the high level of dependency on foreign CAs and increase their digital autonomy.</description>

      <title>Semantic Edge Computing and Semantic Communications in 6G Networks: A Unifying Survey and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.</description>

      <title>Memory-efficient Sketch Acceleration for Handling Large Network Flows on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sketch-based algorithms for network traffic monitoring have drawn increasing interest in recent years due to their sub-linear memory efficiency and high accuracy. As the volume of network traffic grows, software-based sketch implementations cannot match the throughput of the incoming network flows. FPGA-based hardware sketch has shown better performance compared to software running on a CPU when handling these packets. Among the various sketch algorithms, Count-min sketch is one of the most popular and efficient. However, due to the limited amount of on-chip memory, the FPGA-based count-Min sketch accelerator suffers from performance drops as network traffic grows. In this work, we propose a hardware-friendly architecture with a variable width memory counter for count-min sketch. Our architecture provides a more compact design to store the sketch data structure effectively, allowing us to support larger hash tables and reduce overestimation errors. The design makes use of a P4-based programmable data plane and the AMD OpenNIC shell. The design is implemented and verified on the Open Cloud Testbed running on AMD Alveo U280s and can keep up with the 100 Gbit link speed.</description>
