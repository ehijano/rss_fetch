      <title>A Workflow-Centric Approach to Generating FAIR Data Objects for Mechanical Properties of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a data perspective, the field of materials mechanics is characterized by a sparsity of available data, mainly due to the strong microstructure-sensitivity of properties such as strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue limit. Consequently, individual tests are needed for specimens with various thermo-mechanical process histories, even if their chemical composition remains the same. Experimental data on the mechanical behavior of materials is usually rare, as mechanical testing is typically a destructive method requiring large amounts of material and effort for specimen preparation and testing. Furthermore, mechanical behavior is typically characterized in simplified tests under uniaxial loading conditions, whereas a complete characterization of mechanical material behavior requires multiaxial testing conditions. To address this data sparsity, different simulation methods, such as micromechanical modeling or even atomistic simulations, can contribute to microstructure-sensitive data collections. These methods cover a wide range of materials with different microstructures characterized under multiaxial loading conditions. In the present work, we describe a novel data schema that integrates metadata and mechanical data itself, following the workflows of the material modeling processes by which the data has been generated. Each run of this workflow results in unique data objects due to the incorporation of various elements such as user, system, and job-specific information in correlation with the resulting mechanical properties. Hence, this integrated data format provides a sustainable way of generating data objects that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The choice of metadata elements has centered on necessary features required to characterize microstructure-specific data objects, simplifying how purpose-specific datasets are collected by search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Accelerating crystal structure search through active learning with neural networks for rapid relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global optimization of crystal compositions is a significant yet computationally intensive method to identify stable structures within chemical space. The specific physical properties linked to a three-dimensional atomic arrangement make this an essential task in the development of new materials. We present a method that efficiently uses active learning of neural network force fields for structure relaxation, minimizing the required number of steps in the process. This is achieved by neural network force fields equipped with uncertainty estimation, which iteratively guide a pool of randomly generated candidates towards their respective local minima. Using this approach, we are able to effectively identify the most promising candidates for further evaluation using density functional theory (DFT). Our method not only reliably reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude across the benchmark systems Si16 , Na8Cl8 , Ga8As8 and Al4O6 , but also excels in finding the most stable minimum for the unseen, more complex systems Si46 and Al16O24 . Moreover, we demonstrate at the example of Si16 that our method can find multiple relevant local minima while only adding minor computational effort.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widely used thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is generalized to include the effect of electron correlation while maintaining its quasi-independent-particle framework. An electron-correlated internal energy (or grand potential) is defined by the second-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which then dictates the corresponding thermal orbital (quasi-particle) energies in such a way that all thermodynamic relations are obeyed. The associated density matrix is of the one-electron type, whose diagonal elements take the form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, when the grand potential is minimized. The formulas for the entropy and chemical potential are unchanged from those of Fermi-Dirac or thermal HF theory. The theory thus postulates a finite-temperature extension of the second-order Dyson self-energy of one-particle many-body Green's function theory and can be viewed as a second-order, diagonal, frequency-independent, thermal inverse Dyson equation. At low temperature, the theory approaches finite-temperature MBPT of the same order, but it outperforms the latter at intermediate temperature by including additional electron-correlation effects through orbital energies. A physical meaning of these thermal orbital energies (including that of thermal HF orbital energies, which has been elusive) is proposed.</description>

      <title>A systematic Investigation of Thermoelectric Properties of Monolayers of ZrX2N4(X = Si, Ge)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, it has been demonstrated that monolayers of metal dichalcogenides are well-suited for thermoelectric applications. ZrX2N4 (X = Si, Ge) is a reasonable choice for thermoelectric applications when considering a favorable value of the figure of merit in two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. In this study, we examined the thermoelectric characteristics of the two-dimensional monolayer of ZrX2N4 (where X can be either Si or Ge) using a combination of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). A thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.90 was achieved at a temperature of 900 K for p-type ZrGe2N4, while a ZT of 0.83 was reported for n-type ZrGe2N4 at the same temperature. In addition, the ZrGe2N4 material exhibited a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of around 0.7 at room temperature for the p-type. Conversely, the ZrSi2N4 exhibited a relatively lower thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) at ambient temperature. At higher temperatures, the ZT value experiences a substantial increase, reaching 0.89 and 0.82 for p-type and n-type materials, respectively, at 900 K. Through our analysis of the electronic band structure, we have determined that ZrSi2N4 and ZrGe2N4 exhibit indirect bandgaps (BG) of 2.74 eV and 2.66 eV, respectively, as per the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) approximation.</description>

      <title>Classification of synchronization in nonlinear systems using ICO learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the implications of the differential Hebbian learning rule known as Input-Correlations (ICO) learning in the classification of synchronization in coupled nonlinear oscillator systems. We are investigating the parity-time symmetric coupled Duffing oscillator system with nonlinear dissipation/amplification. In our investigation of the temporal dynamics of this system, it is observed that the system exhibits chaotic as well as quasiperiodic dynamics. On further investigation, it is found that the chaotic dynamics is distorted anti-phase synchronized, whereas the quasiperiodic dynamics is desynchronized. So, on the application of the ICO learning in these two parametric regimes, we observe that the weight associated with the stimulus remains constant when the oscillators are anti-phase synchronized, in spite of there being distortion in the synchronization. But when the oscillators exhibit quasiperiodic dynamics, there is erratic evolution of the weight with time. So, from this, it could be ascertained that the ICO learning could be made use of in the classification of synchronization dynamics in nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions of calcium carbonate by molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calcium carbonate plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, and its phase diagram has always been of significant scientific interest. In this study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate several structural phase transitions of calcium carbonate. Using the Raiteri potential model, we explored the structural transitions occurring at a constant pressure of 1 bar with temperatures ranging from 300 K to 2500 K, and at a constant temperature of 1600 K with pressures ranging from 0 to 13 GPa. At increasing temperatures, the transitions calcite, CaCO$_3$-IV, and CaCO$_3$-V are observed and characterized. Within the calcite structure, CO$_3^{2-}$ ions are ordered between layers. As temperature increases, the calcite to CaCO$_3$-IV transition occurs, determining the partial disordering of CO$_3^{2-}$ ions. At a higher temperature, CaCO$_3$-IV transforms into CaCO$_3$-V. By applying free energy analysis, we have classified the last transition as a continuous order-disorder phase transition. At a temperature of 2000 K, it appears a `disordered CaCO$_3$' structure, characterized by low order within the calcium and carbonate sublattices and the free rotation of CO$_3^{2-}$ ions. At increasing pressures, two calcium carbonate transformations were observed. At $P=$ 2 GPa, the CaCO$_3$-IV phase undergoes a phase transition into CaCO$_3$-V, demonstrating that the model can describe the transition between these two phases as pressure and temperature-driven. Another phase transition was detected at $P=$ 4.25 GPa -- CaCO$_3$-V transits into the recently discovered CaCO$_3$-Vb phase. This transition is classified as a first-order phase transition by structural analysis and free energy-based arguments.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dingerNet: A Universal Neural Network Solver for The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated numerically accurate solution of the electronic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (SE) by integrating various neural network (NN)-based wavefunction ansatzes with variational Monte Carlo methods. Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require computationally expensive training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a novel NN architecture, Schr\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear SE by defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the system. This approach is based on a rotationally equivariant total wavefunction ansatz that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy not only allows for the efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential energy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration space, but also incorporates non-BOA corrections through a single training process. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and molecular systems demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>TOF MLEM Adaptation for the Total-Body J-PET with a Realistic Analytical System Response Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a study of the original image reconstruction algorithm based on the time-of-flight maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (TOF MLEM), developed for the total-body (TB) Jagiellonian PET (J-PET) scanners. The method is applicable to generic cylindrical or modular multi-layer layouts and is extendable to multi-photon imaging. The system response matrix (SRM) is represented as a set of analytical functions, uniquely defined for each pair of plastic scintillator strips used for the detection. A realistic resolution model (RM) in detector space is derived from fitting the Monte Carlo simulated emissions and detections of annihilation photons on oblique transverse planes. Additional kernels embedded in SRM account for TOF, parallax effect and axial smearing. The algorithm was tested on datasets, simulated in GATE for the NEMA IEC and static XCAT phantoms inside a 24-module 2-layer TB J-PET. Compared to the reference TOF MLEM with none or a shift-invariant RM, an improvement was observed, as evaluated by the analysis of image quality, difference images and ground truth metrics. We also reconstructed the data with additive contributions, pre-filtered geometrically and with non-TOF scatter correction applied. Despite some deterioration, the obtained results still capitalise on the realistic RM with better edge preservation and superior ground truth metrics. The envisioned prospects of the TOF MLEM with analytical SRM include its application in multi-photon imaging and further upgrade to account for the non-collinearity, positron range and other factors.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Adiabatic Learning for Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-classical hybrid dynamics is crucial for accurately simulating complex systems where both quantum and classical behaviors need to be considered. However, coupling between classical and quantum degrees of freedom and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space present significant challenges. Current machine learning approaches for predicting such dynamics, while promising, remain unknown in their error bounds, sample complexity, and generalizability. In this work, we establish a generic theoretical framework for analyzing quantum-classical adiabatic dynamics with learning algorithms. Based on quantum information theory, we develop a provably efficient adiabatic learning (PEAL) algorithm with logarithmic system size sampling complexity and favorable time scaling properties. We benchmark PEAL on the Holstein model, and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting single-path dynamics and ensemble dynamics observables as well as transfer learning over a family of Hamiltonians. Our framework and algorithm open up new avenues for reliable and efficient learning of quantum-classical dynamics.</description>
