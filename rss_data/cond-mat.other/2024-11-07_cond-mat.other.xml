      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian and effective temperature of non-Hermitian quantum spin ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17062v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystal symmetry of lead halide perovskites on the optical orientation of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The great variety of lead halide perovskite semiconductors represents an outstanding platform for studying crystal symmetry effects on the spin-dependent properties. Access to them is granted through optical orientation of exciton and carrier spins by circularly polarized photons. Here, the exciton spin polarization is investigated at $1.6$\,K cryogenic temperature in four lead halide perovskite crystals with different symmetries: (almost) cubic in FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ and FAPbBr$_3$, and orthorhombic in MAPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$. Giant optical orientation of 85\% is found for the excitons in FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$, MAPbI$_3$, and CsPbBr$_3$, while it amounts to 20\% in FAPbBr$_3$. For all studied crystals, the optical orientation is robust to detuning of the laser photon energy from the exciton resonance, remaining constant for high energy detunings up to 0.3~eV, above which it continuously decreases to zero for detunings exceeding 1~eV. No acceleration of the spin relaxation for excitons with large kinetic energy is found in the cubic and orthorhombic crystals. This evidences the absence of the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism, which is based on the Rashba-Dresselhaus splitting of spin states at finite $k$-vectors. This indicates that the spatial inversion symmetry is maintained in perovskite crystals, independent of the cubic or orthorhombic phase.</description>

      <title>Mode-locked GaN waveguide polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: So far, exciton-polariton (polariton) lasers were mostly single mode lasers based on microcavities. Despite the large repulsive polariton-polariton interaction, pulsed mode-locked polariton laser was never reported. Here, we use a $60 \ \mu m-$long GaN-based waveguide surrounded by distributed Bragg reflectors forming a multi-mode horizontal cavity. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically a polariton mode-locked micro-laser operating in the blue-UV, at room temperature, with a 300$\ GHz$ repetition rate and 100$\ fs$-long pulses. The mode locking is demonstrated by the compensation (linearization) of the mode dispersion by the self-phase modulation induced by the polariton-polariton interaction. It is also supported by the observation in experiment and theory of the typical envelope frequency profile of a bright soliton.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Induced Exchange Gate Infidelities in Semiconducting Si-SiGe Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-spin exchange interactions between semiconductor spin qubits allow for fast single and two-qubit gates. During exchange, coupling of the qubits to a surrounding phonon bath may cause errors in the resulting gate. Here, the fidelities of exchange operations with semiconductor double quantum dot spin qubits in a Si-SiGe heterostructure coupled to a finite temperature phonon bath are considered. By employing a master equation approach, the isolated effect of each spin-phonon coupling term may be resolved, as well as leakage errors of encoded qubit operations. As the temperature is increased, a crossover is observed from where the primary source of error is due to a phonon induced perturbation of the two electron spin states, to one where the phonon induced coupling to an excited orbital state becomes the dominant error. Additionally, it is shown that a simple trade-off in pulse shape and length can improve robustness to spin-phonon induced errors during gate operations by up to an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that for elevated temperatures within 200-300 mK, exchange gate operations are not currently limited by bulk phonons. This is consistent with recent experiments.</description>
