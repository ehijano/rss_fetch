      <title>A Pseudo-Fermion Propagator Approach to the Fermion Sign Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, within the framework of path integral Monte Carlo, we construct a pseudo-fermion propagator by replacing the original fermionic determinant with its absolute value. This modified propagator defines an auxiliary system free from the fermion sign problem, enabling efficient simulations of fermionic systems. We found that by shifting the pseudo-fermion energy based on the energy of a non-interacting fermion system, we can efficiently and reliably infer the energy of fermionic systems in various situations, from strong quantum degeneracy to weak quantum degeneracy. We have performed first-principles simulations of quantum dots confined in a two-dimensional harmonic potential and found excellent agreement with benchmark results provided by other established methods. We believe that this pseudo-fermion propagator framework opens up new possibilities for first-principles simulations of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>The First Differentiable Transfer-Based Algorithm for Discrete MicroLED Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a 50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000 arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for accelerating microLED repair in AR/VR and next-generation display fabrication.</description>

      <title>GPU accelerated MHD in the DISPATCH framework using directive-based programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver using directive-based programming with OpenMP target offloading. The solver is integrated into the DISPATCH framework, which organises the computational domain into a collection of asynchronously updated patches. To reduce GPU kernel launch overhead, patches are grouped into "bunches" that are updated collectively. While porting the particular solver required a complete code refactoring, it yielded performance gains on both GPU and CPU. A stand-alone mini-app achieved a 7.3x speed-up compared to a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to seven AMD 7F72 Rome CPU cores. Within the full DISPATCH framework, the GPU-accelerated MHD Bunch solver showed excellent agreement with the CPU-based reference implementation on standard test problems such as the Sod shock tube and Orszag-Tang vortex. In large-scale 3D tests, the GPU implementation achieved a 9.8x overall speedup, comparing one GPU to 12 CPU cores, with the core MHD update routine being two orders of magnitude faster on the GPU than on a single CPU core. These results demonstrate that OpenMP offloading can provide substantial performance improvements for astrophysical codes while maintaining portability and accuracy. The work also demonstrates how new codes should be structured to allow simple and efficient directive-based GPU offloading.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer flow dynamics of propulsive flapping foils with increasing Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09590v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study flapping foils at optimally propulsive Strouhal number $St=0.3$ with increasing chord-based Reynolds number at $Re = 10^4$, $10^5$, and $10^6$ to examine changes in their unsteady boundary layers. Despite being prescribed the same freestream, the inner boundary layer characteristics exhibit different trends due to the generation of leading-edge vortices (LEVs) and their advection into the downstream flow. Propulsive flapping foils show an extended laminar region known as the relaminarization, during which the velocity profiles deviate from the standard log law. This relaminarization is accompanied by a significant decrease in the cyclic fluctuation of the wall friction coefficient and an increase in the shape factor while the freestream velocity increases under favourable pressure gradient conditions. This phenomenon intensifies with increasing $Re$. We found that higher $Re$ produces smaller LEVs in greater quantities, with a more rapid but stable breakdown, without resulting in a more chaotic turbulent downstream. This study strongly indicates that the relaminarization could extend beyond $Re=10^6$ as predicted by Fukagata[Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 2023]. The results support the potential for further exploration of flapping foils at high $Re$ for noise and drag reduction.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection: A Comparative Analysis Using Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising 3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\% accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\% accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.</description>

      <title>Efficient predecision scheme for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation of long-range interacting lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fast and general predecision scheme for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation of $d$-dimensional long-range interacting lattice models. For potentials of the form $V(r)=r^{-d-\sigma}$, this reduces the computational complexity from $O\left(N^2\right)$ to $O\left(N^{2-\sigma/d}\right)$ for $\sigma &lt; d$ and to $O\left(N \right)$ for $\sigma &gt; d$, respectively. The algorithm is implemented and tested for several $\mathrm{O}(n)$ spin models ranging from the Ising over the XY to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model. With the same random number sequence it produces exactly the same Markov chain as a simulation with explicit summation of all terms in the Hamiltonian. Due to its generality, its simplicity, and its reduced computational complexity it has the potential to find broad application and thus lead to a deeper understanding of the role of long-range interactions in the physics of lattice models, especially in nonequilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Analytical coarse grained potential parameterization by Reinforcement Learning for anisotropic cellulose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals(CNC) is a nano form of cellulose with great mechanical performance and other merit attributes. Revealed by preceding researches of experiments and molecular simulations, CNC has an anisotropic structure, in which hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role. Understanding structure and mechanical behavior of CNC in a mesoscopic scale is critical to improve manufacturing process and property of final products, in which experiment observation and atomistic simulation are not appropriate. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been an important power source for many industrial and academic achievements in lots of fields. Nevertheless, the potential of RL has not been fully utilized in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we introduce an analytical coarse grained (CG) potential directly parameterized by RL. We utilize RL and Boltzmann inversion to develop a novel CG model of cellulose with consideration of anisotropy and other properties like polymer stiffness. Resultant CG model is not limited to target properties for training, and it could present mechanical properties under other circumstances without additional training. With a little help of prior physical knowledge, the results show that RL could help us parameterize potentials and help us better understand the interactions among particles. Our model illustrates the capability of RL to construct a CG potential which are physically explainable and powerful.</description>

      <title>Fragment size density estimator for shrinkage-induced fracture based on a physics-informed neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Mechanics to Organic Liquid Properties via a Universal Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>An hp Multigrid Approach for Tensor-Product Space-Time Finite Element Discretizations of the Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a monolithic $hp$ space-time multigrid method for tensor-product space-time finite element discretizations of the Stokes equations. Geometric and polynomial coarsening of the space-time mesh is performed, and the entire algorithm is expressed through rigorous mathematical mappings. For the discretization, we use inf-sup stable pairs $\mathbb Q_{r+1}/\mathbb P_{r}^{\text{disc}}$ of elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin (DG$(k)$) discretization in time with piecewise polynomials of order $k$. The key novelty of this work is the application of $hp$ multigrid techniques in space and time, facilitated and accelerated by the matrix-free capabilities of the deal$.$II library. While multigrid methods are well-established for stationary problems, their application in space-time formulations encounter unique challenges, particularly in constructing suitable smoothers. To overcome these challenges, we employ space-time cell and vertex star patch based Vanka smoothers. Extensive tests on high-performance computing platforms demonstrate the efficiency of our \( hp \) multigrid approach on problem sizes exceeding a trillion degrees of freedom (dofs), sustaining throughputs of hundreds of millions of dofs per second.</description>

      <title>Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a design rule check correction algorithm to more readily meet fabrication constraints, resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. A statistical study is performed on a 2D modal multiplexer, revealing that 87% of devices optimized using this strategy conform to foundry constraints, compared to 13% of devices optimized using traditional TO. We apply seeded topology optimization to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. Using this optimization strategy, the measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from &lt; 1.50 dB to &lt; 0.64 dB, and the measured TE1 insertion loss of the TE modal multiplexer was reduced from &lt; 3.95 dB to &lt; 1.38 dB over C-band. This approach enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>
