      <title>Turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath: space-time correlation using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal correlation of magnetic field fluctuations is investigated using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The first observation of the turbulence propagator in space emerges through analysis of more than a thousand intervals. Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfv\'enic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides unprecedented insight into the space-time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.</description>

      <title>Proton specific entropy as a proxy for the $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ charge state ratio over heliocentric distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the fast solar wind has well-established origins in coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind remains uncertain. Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Beacon2Science: Enhancing STEREO/HI beacon data with machine learning for efficient CME tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing and forecasting coronal mass ejections (CME) in real-time is crucial due to the strong geomagnetic storms they can generate that can have a potentially damaging effect, for example, on satellites and electrical devices. With its near-real-time availability, STEREO/HI beacon data is the perfect candidate for early forecasting of CMEs. However, previous work concluded that CME arrival prediction based on beacon data could not achieve the same accuracy as with high-resolution science data due to data gaps and lower quality. We present our novel machine-learning pipeline entitled ``Beacon2Science'', bridging the gap between beacon and science data to improve CME tracking. Through this pipeline, we first enhance the quality (signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution) of beacon data. We then increase the time resolution of enhanced beacon images through learned interpolation to match science data's 40-minute resolution. We maximize information coherence between consecutive frames with adapted model architecture and loss functions through the different steps. The improved beacon images are comparable to science data, showing better CME visibility than the original beacon data. Furthermore, we compare CMEs tracked in beacon, enhanced beacon, and science images. The tracks extracted from enhanced beacon data are closer to those from science images, with a mean average error of $\sim 0.5 ^\circ$ of elongation compared to $1^\circ$ with original beacon data. The work presented in this paper paves the way for its application to forthcoming missions such as Vigil and PUNCH.</description>

      <title>$\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$, outer boundary, and Biot-Savart in magnetosphere MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the size of $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ and outer surface boundary integrals in estimating the surface magnetic field from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Maxwell's equations tell us $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ = 0, which may be violated due to numerical error. MHD models, such as the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) and the Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), use different techniques to limit $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$. Analyses of MHD simulations typically assume $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ errors are small. Similarly, analyses commonly use the Biot-Savart Law and magnetospheric current density estimates from MHD simulations to determine the magnetic field at a specific point on Earth. This calculation frequently omits the surface integral over the outer boundary of the simulation volume that the Helmholtz decomposition theorem requires. This paper uses SWMF and OpenGGCM simulations to estimate the magnitudes of the $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ and outer boundary integrals compared to Biot-Savart estimates of the magnetic field on Earth. In the simulations considered, the $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ and outer surface integrals are up to 30 percent of Biot-Savart estimates when the Biot-Savart estimates are large. We conclude rather than using the Biot--Savart Law to estimate the magnetic field from the magnetosphere, it is better and computationally more efficient to use the integral over the inner boundary of the magnetosphere. The conclusions are the same for a simulation involving a simple change in the interplanetary magnetic field and a more complex superstorm simulation.</description>
