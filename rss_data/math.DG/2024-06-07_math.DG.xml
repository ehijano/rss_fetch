      <title>Gravitating vortices and Symplectic Reduction by Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a novel approach to the existence problem for gravitating vortices on a Riemann surface based on symplectic reduction by stages, which seems to be new in the PDE as well as the gauge theory literature. The main technical tool for our study is the reduced $\alpha$-K-energy, for which we establish convexity properties by means of finite-energy pluripotential theory, as recently applied to the study of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. Using these methods, we prove that the existence of solutions to the gravitating vortex equations on the sphere implies the polystability of the effective divisor defined by the zeroes of the Higgs field. This approach also enables us to establish the uniqueness of gravitating vortices in any admissible K\"ahler class, in the absence of automorphisms. Lastly, we also prove the existence of solutions for the gravitating vortex equations for genus $g\geq 1$ for certain ranges of the coupling constant $\alpha$ and the volume.</description>

      <title>Weighted Voronoi-Delaunay dual on polyhedral surfaces and its finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to give a strict proof of the existence and uniqueness of the weighted Voronoi decomposition and the dual weighted Delaunay triangulation on Euclidean and hyperbolic polyhedral surface as well as hyperbolic surface with geodesic boundaries. Since the former definition of the Voronoi cell may not be simply connected, we slightly adjust the definition. Our proof is to construct an isotopic map instead of using the edge-flipping algorithm, which is a generalization of the one by Dyer et al. The main theorem of this paper is a lemma for proving the existence of the inversive distance circle packing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss models of the G\"odel Universe as Lie groups with left-invariant Lorentz metric for two simply connected four-dimensional Lie groups, the Iwasawa decomposition for semisimple Lie groups, and left-invariant Lorentz metric on $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, following K.-H.~Neeb. Also we show that the isometry between two non-isomorphic sub-Riemannian Lie group, constructed by A.~Agrachev and D.~Barilari, is induced by some Iwasawa decomposition of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>On the Scalar Curvature Compactness Conjecture in the Conformal Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is a sequence of Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature, satisfying some conditions to keep the sequence reasonable, compact? What topology should one use for the convergence and what is the regularity of the limit space? In this paper we explore these questions by studying the case of a sequence of Riemannian manifolds which are conformal to the $n$-dimensional round sphere. We are able to show that the sequence of conformal factors are compact in several analytic senses and are able to establish $C^0$ convergence away from a singular set of small volume in a similar fashion as C. Dong. Under a bound on the total scalar curvature we are able to show that the limit conformal factor has weak positive scalar curvature in the sense of weakly solving the conformal positive scalar curvature equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $3 \leq n \leq 7$, and let $g$ be a Riemannian metric on $B^2 \times T^{n-2}$ with scalar curvature at least $-n(n-1)$. We establish an inequality relating the systole of the boundary to the infimum of the mean curvature on the boundary. As a consequence, we confirm a conjecture of Horowitz and Myers.</description>

      <title>BPS complexes and Chern--Simons theories from $G$-structures in gauge theory and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a variety of physical systems in which one has states that can be thought of as generalised instantons. These include Yang--Mills theories on manifolds with a torsion-free $G$-structure, analogous gravitational instantons and certain supersymmetric solutions of ten-dimensional supergravity, using their formulation as generalised $G$-structures on Courant algebroids. We provide a universal algebraic construction of a complex, which we call the BPS complex, that computes the infinitesimal moduli space of the instanton as one of its cohomologies. We call a class of these spinor type complexes, which are closely connected to supersymmetric systems, and show how their Laplacians have nice properties. In the supergravity context, the BPS complex becomes a double complex, in a way that corresponds to the left- and right-moving sectors of the string, and becomes much like the double complex of $(p,q)$-forms on a K\"ahler manifold. If the BPS complex has a symplectic inner product, one can write down an associated linearised BV Chern--Simons theory, which reproduces several classic examples in gauge theory. We discuss applications to (quasi-)topological string theories and heterotic superpotential functionals, whose quadratic parts can also be constructed naturally from the BPS complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reduce Yang-Mills equations for $SO^+(p,q)$, $Spin^+(p,q)$ and $SU(n)$ bundles, with constant and isotropic metrics, by developing the concept of $SO^+(p,q)$-equivariance. This allows us to model the electroweak interaction and $SO^+(p,q)$ bundles with a non-linear second order differential equation as well as the weak and strong interaction with a non-linear wave equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 3$ and $S \rightarrow X$ a $2:1$ branched covering defined by a generic quadratic differential on $X$. In the following notes, we explore how taking direct images of line bundles defined by certain distinguished special divisors on $S$ gives rank-2 bundles having nilpotent Higgs fields on $X$. The key ingredient is the notion of Baker-Akhiezer divisors associated to Higgs bundles and choices of subbundles of the underlying rank-2 bundles.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization in Control: Geometry and Algorithmic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey explores the geometric perspective on policy optimization within the realm of feedback control systems, emphasizing the intrinsic relationship between control design and optimization. By adopting a geometric viewpoint, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of how various ``complete parameterization'' -- referring to the policy parameters together with its Riemannian geometry -- of control design problems, influence stability and performance of local search algorithms. The paper is structured to address key themes such as policy parameterization, the topology and geometry of stabilizing policies, and their implications for various (non-convex) dynamic performance measures. We focus on a few iconic control design problems, including the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. In particular, we first discuss the topology and Riemannian geometry of stabilizing policies, distinguishing between their static and dynamic realizations. Expanding on this geometric perspective, we then explore structural properties of the aforementioned performance measures and their interplay with the geometry of stabilizing policies in presence of policy constraints; along the way, we address issues such as spurious stationary points, symmetries of dynamic feedback policies, and (non-)smoothness of the corresponding performance measures. We conclude the survey with algorithmic implications of policy optimization in feedback design.</description>

      <title>On the Legendrian realisation of parametric families of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the natural inclusion of the space of Legendrian embeddings in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{\operatorname{std}})$ into the space of smooth embeddings from a homotopical viewpoint.
  T. K\'alm\'an posed in [Kal] the open question of whether for every fixed knot type $\mathcal{K}$ and Legendrian representative $\mathcal{L}$, the homomorphism $\pi_1(\mathcal{L})\to\pi_1(\mathcal{K})$ is surjective. We positively answer this question for infinitely many knot types $\mathcal{K}$ in the three main families (hyperbolic, torus and satellites) and every stabilised Legendrian representative in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{\operatorname{std}})$.
  We then show that for every $n\geq 3$, the homomorphisms $\pi_n(\mathcal{L})\to\pi_n(\mathcal{K})$ and $\pi_n(\mathcal{FL})\to\pi_n(\mathcal{K})$ are never surjective for any knot type $\mathcal K$, Legendrian representative $\mathcal L$ or formal Legendrian representative $\mathcal{FL}$. This shows the existence of rigidity at every higher-homotopy level beyond $\pi_3$. For completeness, we also show that surjectivity at the $\pi_2$-level depends on the smooth knot type.</description>

Abstract: The conformal heat flow for harmonic maps is a system of evolution equations combined with harmonic map flow with metric evolution in conformal direction. It is known that global weak solution of the flow exists and smooth except at mostly finitely many singular points. In this paper, we show that no finite time singularity occurs, unlike the usual harmonic map flow. And if the initial energy is small, we can obtain the uniform convergence of the map and the conformal factor. Also, under the assumption that energy concentration is uniform in time, we show that there exists a sequence of time $t_n \to \infty$ such that $f(\cdot,t_n)$ converges to a harmonic map in $C^1$ on any compact set away from at most finitely many points.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to present a systematic study on the Gauss images of complete minimal surfaces of genus 0 of finite total curvature in Euclidean 3-space and Euclidean 4-space. We focus on the number of omitted values and the total weight of the totally ramified values of their Gauss maps. In particular, we construct new complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature whose Gauss maps have 2 omitted values and 1 totally ramified value of order 2, that is, the total weight of the totally ramified values of their Gauss maps are 5/2 (=2.5) in Euclidean 3-space and Euclidean 4-space, respectively. Moreover we discuss several outstanding problems in this study.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Geometry to Higher Order in the Infinitesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential geometry may be generalized to allow infinitesimals to any order. The purpose of the present contribution is to show that the theory so developed expands received geometrical ideas in an interesting way, rich in potential for future exploration. The first order of business is to furnish the notion of a higher tangent vector, as defined abstractly by means of commutative algebra, with a workable interpretation in terms of spatial intuition. Then we introduce the differential calculus of the so-called jet connection, viz., an extension of the usual affine connection that takes higher tangent vectors as its arguments -- thereby enabling us to give a sense to parallel transport in the direction of a higher tangent, what has (to our knowledge) never been entertained before. After generalizing the Riemannian metric tensor to include a dependence up to any order in the infinitesimals, we arrive at natural analogues of the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemannian curvature tensor which display novel phenomena rooted in interactions among infinitesimals differing in order. Finally on the integral side, an intrinsic theory of integration adapted to integrands possibly of higher than first order in the differentials is developed, with a view towards eventually defining an action functional that will be applicable in the general theory of relativity.</description>

Abstract: We prove optimal transport stability (in the sense of Andreasson and the second author) for reflexive Weyl polytopes: reflexive polytopes which are convex hulls of an orbit of a Weyl group. When the reflexive Weyl polytope is Delzant, it follows from work of Li, Andreasson, Hultgren, Jonsson, Mazzon, McCleerey, that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for the Dwork family in the corresponding toric Fano manifold. In particular, we show that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for centrally symmetric smooth Fano toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Quantum cohomology of twistor spaces and their Lagrangian submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:1106.3959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the classical and quantum cohomology rings of the twistor spaces of 6-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds and the eigenvalues of quantum multiplication by the first Chern class. Given a half-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold we associate, after Reznikov, a monotone Lagrangian submanifold of the twistor space. In the case of a 3-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold of a hyperbolic 6-manifold we compute the obstruction term $m_0$ in the Fukaya-Floer $A_{\infty}$-algebra of a Reznikov Lagrangian and calculate the Lagrangian quantum homology. There is a well-known correspondence between the possible values of $m_0$ for a Lagrangian with nonvanishing Lagrangian quantum homology and eigenvalues for the action of $c_1$ on quantum cohomology by quantum cup product. Reznikov's Lagrangians account for most of these eigenvalues but there are four exotic eigenvalues we cannot account for.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the regularity of the extremal function of a compact subset of a compact K\"ahler manifold is a local property, and that the continuity and H\"older continuity are equivalent to classical notions of the local $L$-regularity and the locally H\"older continuous property in pluripolential theory. As a consequence we give an effective characterization of the $(\Cc^\al, \Cc^{\al'})$-regularity of compact sets, the notion introduced by Dinh, Ma and Nguyen. Using this criterion all compact fat subanalytic subsets in $\bR^n$ are shown to be regular in this sense.</description>
