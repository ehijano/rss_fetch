      <title>Ringdown modulation of acceleration radiation in the Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic, first-order description of how black hole ringdown imprints on the operational signature of near-horizon thermality. Building on a static Schwarzschild baseline in which a freely falling two-level system coupled to a single outgoing mode exhibits geometric photon statistics and a detailed-balance ratio set by the surface gravity, we introduce an even-parity, axisymmetric quadrupolar perturbation and work in an ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein, horizon-regular framework. The perturbation corrects the outgoing eikonal through a gauge-invariant double-null contraction of the metric, yielding a compact redshift map that, when pulled back to the detector worldline, produces a universal, decaying-oscillatory modulation of the Boltzmann exponent at the quasinormal frequency. We derive a closed boundary formula for the response coefficient at the sampling radius, identify the precise adiabatic window in which the result holds, and prove that the modulation vanishes in all stationary limits. Detector specifics (gap, switching wavepacket width) enter only through a smooth prefactor, while the geometric content is captured by the quasinormal pair and the response coefficient. The analysis clarifies that near-horizon "thermality" is robust but not rigid: detailed balance persists as the organizing structure and is gently driven by ringdown dynamics. The framework is minimal yet extensible to other multipoles, parities, and slow rotation, and it suggests direct numerical and experimental cross-checks in controlled analog settings.</description>

      <title>Boson Stars Hosting Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center. We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star. Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.</description>

      <title>The future ability to test theories of gravity with black-hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The horizon-scale images of supermassive black holes (BHs) by
  the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) have provided new
  opportunities to test general relativity and other theories of
  gravity. In view of future projects, such as the next-generation Event
  Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Black-Hole Explorer (BHEX), having
  the potential of enhancing our ability to probe extreme gravity, it is
  natural to ask: \textit{how much can two black-hole images differ?} To
  address this question and assess the ability of these projects to test
  theories of gravity with black-hole shadows, we use
  general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer
  simulations to investigate the images of a wide class of accreting BHs
  deviating from the Kerr solution. By measuring the mismatch between
  images of different BHs we show that future missions will be able to
  distinguish a large class of BHs solutions from the Kerr solution when
  the mismatch in the images exceeds values between $2\%$ and $5\%$
  depending on the image-comparison metric considered. These
  results indicate future horizon-scale imaging with percent-level
  image fidelity can place meaningful observational constraints on
  deviations from the Kerr metric and thereby test strong-field
  predictions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>On the Evidence for Violation of the Equivalence Principle in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the claimed observations of a gravitational external field effect (EFE) reported in Chae et al. We show that observations suggestive of the EFE can be interpreted without violating Einstein's equivalence principle, namely from known correlations between morphology, environment and dynamics of galaxies. While Chae et al's analysis provides a valuable attempt at a clear test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics, an evidently important topic, a re-analysis of the observational data does not permit us to confidently assess the presence of an EFE or to distinguish this interpretation from that proposed in this article.</description>

      <title>Exploring the landscape of black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the possible presence or absence of echo effects.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Constraints on Charged Black Holes in Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), unveiling their distinctive features across multiple physical domains. Our topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry, and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical imaging and lensing campaigns. By connecting theoretical predictions to measurable quantities, we outline specific pathways to confirm or constrain STVG using data from current and future space telescopes.</description>

      <title>Apparent horizon as a membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The requirement that a trapped spacetime domain forms in finite time for distant observers is logically possible and sometimes unavoidable, but its consequences are not yet fully understood. In spherical symmetry, the characterization of the near-horizon geometry of these physical black holes is complete and shows marked differences from their eternal counterparts. Whether these differences lead to observable signatures remains unclear. We construct an approximate near-horizon metric that encapsulates them and is suitable for modeling. The timelike apparent horizon of physical black holes provides a natural surface for a consistent membrane description: we obtain closed-form expressions for the redshift, proper acceleration, and extrinsic curvature, and assign a two-dimensional viscous-fluid stress tensor via junction conditions. These results also provide an additional perspective on the relation between Rindler and near-horizon geometries. Among dynamical generalizations of surface gravity, only a subset applies to these models. We complete their analysis and recover the intuitive definition of surface gravity -- the acceleration in the frame of a near-horizon observer, redshifted to infinity -- directly from the membrane acceleration.</description>

      <title>Scalar superradiance in the charged black-bounce spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the superradiant amplification effect of a charged scalar filed in the scattering experiment and the black hole bomb model in a charged black-bounce spacetime. Due to the shallowing effect on the effective potential by the introduced quantum parameter $\l$, superradiance in both the above cases are verified to be weakened. In a scattering experiment, the quantum parameter and the field mass suppress the amplification in all frequency ranges, while the black hole and field charge influence it differently in high and low frequencies. In a Type I black hole bomb model, where the reflective mirror is placed outside the ergo-region, we find a new distinct eigen-mode for the scalar field evolution in a high $\l$ value, which is however absent in the case of Type II black bomb where the mirror is set inside the ergo-region. Moreover, we investigate the heavy field mass scenario in a Type II black hole bomb and find no amplification effect in this confined configuration.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravitational Wave Speed and Dispersion with LISA Observations of Supermassive Black Hole Binary Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves (GWs) should travel at the speed of light $c$. However, some theories beyond GR predict deviations of the velocity of GWs $c_{\rm gw}$ from $c$, and some of those expect vacuum dispersion. Therefore, probing the propagation effects of GWs by comparing the wave format detectors against the one at emission excepted from GR. Since such propagation effects accumulate through larger distance, it is expected that super-massive black holes binary (SMBHB) mergers serve as better targets than their stellarmass equivalent. In this paper, we study with simulations on how observations on a population of SMBHs can help to study this topic. We simulate LISA observations on three possible SMBHB merger populations, namely Pop\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 3}, Q3-nod and Q3-d over a 5-year mission. The resulting constraints on the graviton mass are \(9.50\), \(9.33\), and \(9.05 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{eV}/c^2\), respectively. We also obtain the corresponding constraints on the dispersion coefficients assuming different dispersion scenarios. If the electromagnetic wave counterparts of SMBHB merger can be detected simultaneously, the $c_{\rm gw}$ can be constrained waveform-independently to \(\Delta c/c\) to \(10^{-13}-10^{-12}\), corresponding to graviton mass constraints of \(10^{-26}-10^{-24} \mathrm{eV}/c^2\).</description>

      <title>Observational Constrains on the Sgr A$^*$ Black Hole Immersed in a Dark Matter Halo: Shadow and S2 Star Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely believed that Sgr A$^*$, located at the center of our Galaxy, is a supermassive black hole. Recent observations of its shadow and long-term monitoring of the S2 star have provided compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis. These observational advancements also offer valuable opportunities to explore the physical properties of the black hole and its surrounding environment. Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and around Sgr A$^*$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo, and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star. Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters. The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Geometric Unification of Timelike Orbital Chaos and Phase Transitions in Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep connection between black hole thermodynamics and spacetime geometry remains a central focus of general relativity. While recent studies have revealed a precise correspondence for null orbits, given by $K = -\lambda^2$ between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, its validity for timelike orbits had remained unknown. Our work introduces the massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructs a new geometric quantity $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G} \propto -\lambda^2$ on unstable timelike orbits, thus establishing the geometry-dynamics correspondence for massive particles. Crucially, near the first-order phase transition of a black hole, $\mathcal{G}$ displays synchronized multivalued behavior with the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and yields a critical exponent $\delta=1/2$. Our results demonstrate that spacetime geometry encodes thermodynamic information, opening a new pathway for studying black hole phase transitions from a geometric perspective.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of scalar-tensor theories and scale-dependent gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Effective matter sectors from modified entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.</description>

      <title>On the foundations and applications of Lorentz-Finsler Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts, key applications, and future prospects.
  The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear) connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz geometries, (iv) real world applications for wildfires and seisms, and discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects, and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to the analysis of several extensions as the case of timelike boundaries.</description>

      <title>Twist and higher modes of a complex scalar field at the threshold of collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the threshold of collapse of a massless complex scalar field in axisymmetric spacetimes under the ansatz of Choptuik et al. 2004, in which a symmetry depending on the azimuthal parameter $m$ is imposed on the scalar field. This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend earlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code bamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon, and a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve near-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest nontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete self-similarity with echoing period $\Delta\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling with exponent $\gamma\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we find that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry class but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\Delta\simeq0.09$ and $\gamma\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical solution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular momentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation, $J_{\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum is minimal at the threshold, with $\chi_{\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\mathrm{AH}}^2\to0$, and, therefore, excludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results demonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the critical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor bifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families considered here.</description>

      <title>On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>Density reconstruction from biased tracers: Testing the equivalence principle through consistency relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful test of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales. If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\mathrm{max}\simeq0.15\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.</description>

      <title>An algebra for covariant observers in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consistent implementation of the gravitational constraints in de Sitter space requires gauging the full $SO(1,d)$ isometry group. In this paper, we develop a framework that enables the gauging of the full de Sitter isometry while consistently incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary geodesics. We achieve this by introducing the concept of \textit{covariant observer}, whose geodesic is a dynamical entity that transforms under the isometry group. Upon quantization, the geodesic becomes a fluctuating degree of freedom, providing a quantum reference frame for $SO(1,d)$. Inspired by the timelike tube theorem, we propose that the algebra of observables is generated by all degrees of freedom within the fluctuating static patch, including the quantum fields modes and other observers. The gauge-invariant subalgebra of observables is an averaged version of the modular crossed product algebra, and we establish its type II character by constructing a trace. This yields a well-defined von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and proposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate that the algebraic and generalized entropies are in match.
  Our work generalizes the notion of a local algebra to that of a \textit{fluctuating region}, representing an average of algebras over all possible static patches and configurations of other geodesics. This provides a complete, covariant, and multi-observer extension of the CLPW construction and lays the foundation for a fully relational quantum gravitational description of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Entanglement Entropy and Edge Modes from Double-Scaled SYK \&amp; Its Connection with Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement entropy in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model, its holographic interpretation in terms of edge modes (acting as quantum reference frames); particularly its de Sitter (dS) space limit; and its connection with Krylov complexity. We define subsystems relative to a particle insertion in the boundary theory. This leads to a natural notion of partial trace and reduced density matrices. The corresponding entanglement entropy takes the form of a generalized horizon entropy in the bulk dual; revealing the emergence of edge modes in the entangling surfaces. We match the entanglement entropy of the DSSYK in an appropriate limit to an area computed through a \emph{Ryu-Takayanagi formula} in dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$; providing a first principles example of holographic entanglement entropy for dS$_2$ space. This formula reproduces the Gibbons-Hawking entropy for specific entangling regions points; while it decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued (since the boundary theory is unitary), and it depends on Krylov state complexity in this limit.</description>

      <title>Seeing double: shock waves and the de Sitter horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a de Sitter observer in his rest frame at late times who observes a particle slightly displaced from unstable equilibrium. Initially, the observer notices an axisymmetric and parity-violating deformation along the trajectory of the displaced particle of his cosmological horizon. On a time scale of order $\ell$, the de Sitter radius, the particle is nearly absorbed by the cosmological horizon and has been accelerated to an ultra-relativistic speed and thus is well approximated as a shock wave. In the shock wave limit, the observer sees an axisymmetric deformation of his horizon with parity restored, which we interpret as arising due to a particle from the complementary static patch. We comment on the holographic implications of this result and note that there is no need to extend the holographic screen of de Sitter spacetime beyond the empty static patch to account for this signal.</description>

      <title>Holographic black hole formation and scrambling in time-ordered correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a holographic mechanism for black hole formation via the collision of two shockwaves in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT), a two-shockwave state corresponds to the insertion of two boosted precursor operators in complementary Rindler patches. Their operator product expansion is initially described by a universal mean field spectrum of exchanged states, which is dominated by operator dimensions that grow exponentially in the boost parameter. We propose their mean value as diagnosing the mass of the collision product in the bulk. It crosses the CFT heavy state threshold after two scrambling times, in accordance with expectations about black hole formation in general relativity. Our analysis also allows us to identify the scrambling characteristics usually associated with out-of-time-order correlation functions, using only the internal composition of thermal in-time-order correlators.</description>

      <title>Transient de Sitter and Quasi de Sitter States in SO(32) and E_8 x E_8 Heterotic String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the long-standing puzzles in string theory has been on the existence of a four-dimensional de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations, the latter being defined with a temporally varying dark energy, in E_8 x E_8 and SO(32) heterotic theories. In this work, novel dynamical duality-sequences are devised that provide natural constructions of de Sitter and quasi de Sitter excited states in the aforementioned theories allowing no late-time singularities. The emergent positive dark energies -- including the intriguing possibility of their slow temporal variations -- appear from Borel resumming Gevrey series from the path-integral representations of such states. Additionally, precise ways to handle the equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations and anomaly cancellations -- consistent with the underlying axionic cosmology and with the probability of forming wormholes that connect baby universes -- are presented for the SO(32) and the E_8 x E_8 theories within a framework that systematically incorporates perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in the far infrared. The temporally varying dark energy, which is much more natural in our set-up because of its emergent nature, surprisingly simplifies many of the aforementioned computations. Interestingly, our analysis also provides, probably for the first time, a set-up to consistently embed four-dimensional standard model degrees of freedom at late time in a realistic gravitational background with positive dark energy from string theory.</description>

      <title>Quadrature-witness readout for backscatter mitigation in gravitational-wave detectors limited by back-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disturbances in gravitational wave (GW) observational data are often caused by non-stationary noise in the detector itself, such as back-scattering of laser stray light into the signal field. Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Statistical Description of Charged de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of de Sitter black holes is complicated by the presence of two horizons and the absence of a globally defined timelike Killing vector. The standard choice of the Gibbons-Hawking Killing vector is at odds with the interpretation of the surface gravity as an acceleration measured by a physical observer at rest. Focusing on four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes we show that this issue can be resolved by adopting a normalization originally proposed by Bousso and Hawking, which defines thermodynamic quantities relative to the unique freely-falling observer at a fixed radial coordinate. Within this framework, we derive new first laws for the black hole and cosmological horizon and re-examine the black hole's heat capacity. We find that the heat capacity remains finite in the near-extremal Nariai limit, thus averting a breakdown of the semi-classical thermodynamic description. However, the heat capacity does vanish in the cold limit, as expected, and for Nariai black holes in the ultracold limit, indicating that fundamental limitations on the statistical description persist in these regimes. We discuss the implications of our results for log-$T$ corrections to near-extremal de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. V. Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe are studied by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. The role of the cosmological constant in the local structure formation is considered via the theorem on the general function satisfying the identity of the gravity of sphere and of point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, local and global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, of Landau damping and then to aperiodic structures. The aperiodicity thus is emerging as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, revealing the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity then is predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase of the scale of the filaments.</description>

      <title>NANOGrav 15-year gravitational-wave signals from binary supermassive black-holes seeded by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\odot} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission. We propose that future observations of the gravitational wave background and the cosmological 21cm line can test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse for Gravitational-Wave Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse (ASPIRE), a broadly applicable framework that transforms existing posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates into unbiased results under alternative models without rerunning the original analysis. ASPIRE combines normalizing flows with a generalized Sequential Monte Carlo scheme, enabling efficient updates of existing results and reducing the computational cost of reanalyses by 4-10 times. This addresses a growing problem in gravitational-wave astronomy, where events must be repeatedly reanalyzed under different models or physical hypotheses. We show that ASPIRE reproduces full Bayesian results when switching waveform models or adding physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. With this statistical robustness, ASPIRE turns repeated reanalyses into fast, reliable updatespaving the way for systematic studies of waveform systematics, scalable reanalyses across large event catalogs, and broadly applicable Bayesian reanalysis across other scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry Breaking with Fields, Strings and Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1 supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes, and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric string vacua.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. In order to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods to investigate APPA's sensitivity via two complementary approaches: Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for axion mass $m_{a}\sim\mathcal{O}\big(10^{-22}-10^{-19}\big)$ eV, APPA yields a better upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations and achieves better detection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Thermal superpotential and thermodynamics of neutral hairy black holes in extended SUGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of exact neutral hairy black-hole solutions with spherical horizon topology in extended supergravity with Fayet--Iliopoulos terms. We consider a consistent dilaton truncation and analyze in detail a sector where the magnetic part of the FI terms vanishes. Using appropriate dilaton counterterms, we compute the thermodynamic quantities and show the existence of Hawking--Page phase transitions. As a holographic application, we derive the thermal superpotential in closed form and use it as a counterterm, explicitly demonstrating that no additional finite counterterms are required to regularize the Euclidean action and the quasi-local stress tensor. The dual stress tensor matches that of a thermal gas of massless particles and is consistent with mixed dilaton boundary conditions that preserve conformal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Cauchy Slice Holography in de Sitter spacetime. By performing a $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic theory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent dimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the dS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting discussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$ deformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article we consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We compute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed boundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time wavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side. The results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\Delta$, and may therefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal series. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT case, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in cosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic counterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction coefficients. But cosmological correlators, calculated by the Born rule, are shifted in a more complicated and nonlinear way.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources II: Joint detections of eccentricity and phase shifts in binary sub-populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where $\ell_{\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\# sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \gtrsim 0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET, our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries merge in AGN migration traps.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir densities for a uniformly accelerating mirror in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region. For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions $D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero. This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <title>KGB-evolution: a relativistic $N$-body code for kinetic gravity braiding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present KGB-evolution, a relativistic $N$-body simulation code that extends the $k$-evolution code by incorporating an effective field theory parameterization of kinetic gravity braiding, while also including the $k$-essence model as a limiting case. As a first step, we implement the linearized dark energy stress-energy tensor and scalar field equations, providing the groundwork for a future full Horndeski theory extension. We validate KGB-evolution by comparing its power spectra against linear predictions from hi$\_$class, finding excellent agreement on large scales at low redshifts and over all scales at high redshifts. We demonstrate that nonlinear growth of matter and metric perturbations on small scales drives the linearized dark energy field into a nonlinear clustering regime, which in turn feeds back on the growth of cosmic structure. In contrast to the $k$-essence limit, a nonzero braiding considerably amplifies this backreaction, producing a significantly stronger alteration of structure formation in the kinetic gravity braiding model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In General Relativity, Birkhoff's theorem asserts that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution must be static and asymptotically flat. In this paper, we study the validity of Birkhoff's theorem for a broad class of modified gravity theories in four spacetime dimensions, including quadratic and higher-order gravity models. We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild spacetime remains the unique Einstein branch solution outside any spherically symmetric configuration of these theories. Consequently, unlike black holes, the breakdown of junction conditions at the surface of the star further implies that the actual spacetime metric outside a horizonless star in these modified theories cannot simultaneously be spherically symmetric and remain within the Einstein branch. This insight offers a unique observational probe for theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetism plays an important role in a variety of applications in gravity that we wish to investigate. To that end, in this work, we present an implementation of the Maxwell equations within the adaptive-mesh pseudospectral numerical relativity code BAMPS. We perform a thorough analysis of the evolution equations as a first order symmetric hyperbolic system of PDEs. This includes both the construction of the characteristic variables for use in our penalty boundary communication scheme, as well as radiation controlling, constraint preserving outer boundary conditions which, for the first time in a numerical context, are shown to be boundary-stable. After choosing a formulation of the Maxwell constraints that we may solve for initial data, we move on to show a suite of numerical tests. Our simulations, both within the Cowling approximation, and in full non-linear evolution, demonstrate rapid convergence of error with resolution, as well as consistency with known quasinormal decay rates on the Kerr background. Finally we evolve the electrovacuum equations of motion with strong data, a good representation of typical critical collapse runs.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The $\bar{\mu}$ Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interactions that give rise to gravity, which involve chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. We argue that these SDCs provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical estimate of the value of the cosmological constant, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant that weakens with time, in agreement with some of the recent evidence, and a proposal about how SDCs give rise to gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the superradiant instability of Kerr-Newman black holes in the presence of a massive, charged scalar field using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas (VBK) method. We study the solutions of the exact polynomial condition for quasibound state frequencies and determine the domain of superradiant instability in parameter space without relying on the hydrogenic approximation or numerics. We derive the minimum scalar mass needed for quasibound states to exist, and identify the precise overlap region between the quasibound and superradiant conditions where instability can occur. We obtain perturbative and exact analytic expressions for the instability boundaries and growth rates, and clarify their relation to previous numerical results. Our analysis reveals how the instability region shifts from nearly neutral Kerr black holes for light fields to highly charged near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes for heavier fields, while remaining absent in the Reissner-Nordstrom limit.</description>

Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field $B_\mu$ has a two-component space-like, light-like, and time-like vacuum expectation value $b_\mu$ is studied. Based on the results, we present a comprehensive classification of the static spherical vacuum solutions in bumblebee gravity with general vacuum expectation values. We find that the model becomes degenerate for a specific set of parameter combinations, where the solution can be characterized by an arbitrary function, which indicates that the non-minimally coupled massless vector tensor theory is ill-defined when $\xi=\kappa/2$. We also find that contrary to the situation in general relativity, the bumblebee gravity admits the exact Schwarzschild solution with non-zero matter distributions of certain forms. The implications of this result are discussed, suggesting that the experimental constraints within the solar system would be invalid.</description>

Abstract: The wide range of nuclear densities achieved in neutron stars makes them probes of dense nuclear behavior in the form of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Studying neutron stars both in isolation, with X-ray measurements and pulse profiling, and in dynamic events, such as neutron star mergers, have provided insight into these high nuclear densities. Though nominally congruent, here we highlight impact of implicit assumptions embedded in joint analysis of these messengers and their systematic impact on EoS inference. We show that astrophysical assumptions and EoS framework can have a larger effect on inferred EoS than individual contemporary neutron star observations. Performing a proof-of-concept demonstration using the chronologically first few observational constraints, after the application of 5 to 6 observational constraints, additional observations provided diminishing returns and modified the inferred EoS by shifting the radius of a 1.4 $\unit{M_\odot}$ NS by $\sim$ 0.1 km. By contrast, astrophysical priors, specifically the spin and mass ratio motivated by astrophysical source population uncertainties, and EoS framework tend to impact EoS inference much more substantially by shifting the 1.4 $\unit{M_\odot}$ NS radius by $\sim$ 0.5 km and by modifying shape of inferred mass-radius relationship. The inferred EoS depends strongly on the adopted choice of spectral parameterizations: when we employ a framework which explicitly enforces causality, we find a strong phase-transition-like feature at $\sim 10^{14.5}$ g cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the right-handed neutrino mass from wash-in leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is an attractive scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe that relies on the dynamics of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) in the seesaw extension of the Standard Model. In standard thermal leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale $M_N$ is subject to the Davidson--Ibarra bound, $M_N \gtrsim 10^9\,\textrm{GeV}$, which builds on the assumption that RHN decays are responsible for the violation of both charge-parity invariance ($CP$) and baryon-minus-lepton number ($B\!-\!L$). In this paper, we relax this assumption in the context of the more flexible framework of wash-in leptogenesis, in which $CP$ violation is encoded in the initial conditions and the only remaining task of the RHN decays is to violate $B\!-\!L$. Solving the relevant set of Boltzmann equations for vanishing initial baryon and lepton numbers (i.e., $B = L_e = L_\mu = L_\tau = 0$ initially), we find that, in wash-in leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale can be as low as 7~TeV. Wash-in leptogenesis at such low RHN masses requires the presence of a primordial charge asymmetry between right-handed electrons and left-handed positrons. We discuss several possibilities for the origin of such an asymmetry and comment on its implications for the chiral instability of the Standard Model plasma.</description>

      <title>A quasi-particle picture for entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal light-curvature couplings and black-hole imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands and focusing on the $n = 1$ lensing band, we illustrate by which diagnostics a modified light propagation may be distinguished from a modified spacetime geometry and how constraints on the value of the non-minimal coupling can be obtained</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation. The inference results can be reproduced through our publicly available code base light.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Many-body chaos and pole-skipping in holographic charged rotating fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution.</description>

      <title>Islands in Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the information paradox in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. We first consider the quantum field in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman spacetime. By employing the near-horizon limit, we demonstrate that the field can be effectively described by a reduced two-dimensional field theory. Consequently, the formula of entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ can be naturally adapted to this reduced two-dimensional theory. Under the framework of this reduced two-dimensional theory, we show that the entanglement entropy of radiation for the non-extremal case satisfies the unitarity in the later stage of the appearance of the entanglement islands. We further examine the impact of angular momentum and charges on the Page time and the scrambling time. Both quantities increases as the angular momentum increases, while decreases as the charge increases. At last, we consider the near extremal case. Resort to the Kerr/CFT correspondence, the near-horizon geometry of near extremal Kerr-Newman black holes can be taken account for a warped AdS geometry. In this scenario, the low-energy effective degrees of freedom are dominated by the Schwarzian zero mode, resulting in a one-loop correction to the partition function. The entanglement entropy is subsequently recalculated under the thermodynamic with corrections. Through explicit calculations, we finally find that the Page time and the scrambling time exhibits quantum delays. This strongly suggests that the near extremal geometry is governed by the Schwarzian dynamics, in which quantum fluctuations result in a reduced rate of information leakage. Our findings further substantiate the conservation of information and extend the applicability of the island paradigm to the most general stationary spacetime background.</description>

      <title>The first year of LISA Galactic foreground</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In this manuscript, we employ the $\texttt{bahamas}$ codebase to characterize, in a global-fit fashion, the reconstruction of the Galactic foreground during the first year of observation. To account for its statistical properties, we represent the data in time--frequency domain, and characterize the effectiveness of multiple approaches, e.g. statistically viable likelihoods, sampling schemes, segmentation widths, and gaps density. Our analysis yields consistent results across, with overwhelming evidence in favor of a non-stationary model in less than a month of data. Moreover, we show robustness against the presence of additional extragalactic foregrounds, and test the suitability of our approximations on the more complex simulated data in the $\textit{Yorsh}$ data challenge.</description>
