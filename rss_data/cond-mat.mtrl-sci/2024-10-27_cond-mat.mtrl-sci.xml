      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with almost no additional overhead, eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. This methodology accelerates the training process by allowing gradient construction on a finite fixed discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without using any labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than 1% error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to map microstructure to mechanical behavior using only physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Furthermore, the zero-shot-super-resolution feature in heterogeneous domains is investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of SPiFOL as a solver for individual microstructures is demonstrated, highlighting the reduction in solving time when utilizing GPUs.</description>

      <title>Growth of Large Area WSe$_{2-x}$ and Observation of Photogenerated Inversion Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report the full-fledged journey towards the material synthesis and characterization of few-layered/thin WSe$_2$ using sputtered W-films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates followed by electrical studies under dark and illumination conditions. Growth temperature 500oC and gas pressure 55 sccm are found to be the optimized parameters for formation of thermodynamically stable WSe$_{2-x}$ with dominant Raman peak at 265 cm-1. XRD and HR-TEM measurement clarify the formation of high crystallinity along the c-axis and quasi-crystallinity along a and b axes respectively. Lower intensities from Raman-measurement and PL-peak at 768 nm (with 532 nm excitation wavelength) infers the thin nature of the grown film, along with strong second harmonic emission with excitation wavelength varying from 350nm to 450 nm. This work also retracks the controlled etching by reactive ions to achieve large area bi/tri-layer films to fabricate advanced devices. We also have fabricated an advanced MOS structure on SiO$_2$/p-Si substrate which shows tremendous performance by means of photo-capacitance under illumination condition where photo-carriers can survive the higher probe frequencies (&gt; 1MHz). Under illumination condition, HfO$_2$/WSe$_2$ embedded MOS shows its dominance showing a huge electron-inversion region over HfO$_2$/ SiO$_2$/p-Si and SiO$_2$/p-Si MOS devices even at high frequencies (1-10 MHz). Thereby, this work also reveals a possible route for capacitance based highly sensitive photodetection using conventional Si-technology with integration of such WSe$_2$/W as an active material.</description>

      <title>Tight-Binding Models for Lone Pair, Heteroanionic Solids, and Application to Layered Oxyhalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a methodology to understand materials with complex bonding patterns, and apply it to the example of heteroanionic and lone pair materials. We build a tight-binding model based on Wannier functions fitted on density functional theory results, followed by enforcing symmetry on the atomic orbital basis set, and finally connecting and disconnecting sets of orbitals from the tight-binding model to understand their individual contribution to the resulting materials properties. We apply this methodology to complex materials, namely BiOCl and Bi$_2$YO$_4$Cl - part of a broader class of materials investigated for their applications in photocatalysis and photoluminescence. Our methodology can be generalized and applied to a wide variety of other materials, including halide perovskites, and multiferroic materials. This methodology allows us to isolate the origin of key electronic features in these materials, including the role of the Bi lone pair-anion bonding interaction - key to photoluminescence in many materials. Finally, we investigate the role of the crystal structure, Chlorine and Oxygen orbital energy levels and bonding in determining the photostability of bismuth oxyhalides. Our methodology allows us to understand the functionality of complex materials in an intuitive and qualitative manner.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale magnetic ordering dynamics in a high Curie temperature ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally driven transitions between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases are characterized by critical behavior with divergent susceptibilities, long-range correlations, and spin dynamics that can span kHz to GHz scales as the material approaches the critical temperature $\mathrm{T_c}$, but it has proven technically challenging to probe the relevant length and time scales with most conventional measurement techniques. In this study, we employ scanning nitrogen-vacancy center based magnetometry and relaxometry to reveal the critical behavior of a high-$\mathrm{T_c}$ ferromagnetic oxide near its Curie temperature. Cluster analysis of the measured temperature-dependent nanoscale magnetic textures points to a 3D universality class with a correlation length that diverges near $\mathrm{T_c}$. Meanwhile, the temperature-dependent spin dynamics, measured through all optical relaxometry suggest that the phase transition is in the XY universality class. Our results capture both static and dynamic aspects of critical behavior, providing insights into universal properties that govern phase transitions in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Framework to Accelerate the Discovery of Hybrid Cathode Materials for Metal-based Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting materials for hybrid cathodes for batteries, which combine intercalation and conversion materials, has gained interest due to their unique synergistic properties, which are not achievable by homogeneous materials. Here, we present a data-driven, chemistry-agnostic, inverse material design framework to discover hybrid cathode materials (HCMs) for metal-based batteries. This framework systematically explores the material space for any working ion, evaluates the stability of candidates, and identifies the growth modes and adsorption of components for a stable hybrid cathode. To demonstrate the framework's application, we conducted a case study aimed at discovering HCMs with an average gravimetric energy density that exceeds the widely used high-energy NMC333 cathode material. The framework identified LiCr$_4$GaS$_8$-Li$_2$S as a promising HCM, achieving an average energy density of 1,424 Wh/kg (on a lithiated cathode basis), surpassing NMC333's theoretical maximum of 1,028 Wh/kg. Additional features of the identified material include: (1) thermodynamically stable lithiated and delithiated intercalation and conversion phases; (2) minimal volume change upon (de)lithiation, which mitigates the conversion material's high volume change; (3) high energy density, compensating for the lower energy density of the intercalation material; (4) the intercalation component acting as both a conductive additive and a sulfur immobilizer while contributing to the total energy density; (5) serving as an ideal support for soft sulfur species; and (6) potential improvements in lifespan, self-discharge, mechanical integrity, and capacity fading compared to conventional Li-S batteries. The developed framework was crucial in exploring materials within the vast potential HCM space with predefined battery material design objectives.</description>

      <title>Bound States in the Continuum in a 2D Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are quantum states that remain localized despite existing within a continuum of extended, delocalized states. They defy conventional wave theories and could be instrumental for quantum technologies that rely on the precise control of quantum states. While optical BICs have been realized in photonic systems, achieving electronic bound states in a metallic background remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we observe two defect states that remain localized within the metallic continuum of Pd5AlI2, a two-dimensional van der Waals metal. The emergence of these states is a manifestation of the hopping interference in the Pd5AlI2 lattice. This interference results in a (quasi) flat band and spatially localized eigenstates that are orthogonal to the metallic continuum thus avoiding hybridization with extended states.</description>

      <title>First-Principles investigations of the thermoelectric properties of CoHfSi half-Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, density functional theory is performed to investigate the phonon dispersion, elastic, thermodynamic, and thermoelectric properties of half-Heusler alloy CoHfSi in Quantum espresso software using First-principles calculations. The alloy is found to be semiconducting with a band gap of 1.13 eV. The material is mechanically stable, as satisfied by the elastic properties in the thermo_pw package using Born-Huang stability criteria. Positive phonon frequencies determine that the material is dynamically stable. BoltzTrap code is utilized to determine the thermoelectric properties. The higher value of the Seebeck coefficient (150{\mu}V/K-250{\mu}V/K) is required for more conversion efficiency. zT increases with the temperature increase and reaches a maximum value of 3 at 850K.</description>

      <title>The use of the correlated Debye model for EXAFS-based thermometry in bcc and fcc metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra are sensitive to thermal disorder and are often used to probe local lattice dynamics. Variations in interatomic distances induced by atomic vibrations are described by the temperature-dependent mean-square relative displacement (MSRD), also known as the Debye-Waller factor. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of addressing the inverse problem, i.e., determining the sample temperature from the analysis of its EXAFS spectrum using the multiple-scattering formalism, considering contributions up to the 4th-7th coordination shell. The method was tested on several monatomic metals (bcc Cr, Mo, and W; fcc Cu and Ag), where the correlated Debye model of lattice dynamics provides a fairly accurate description of thermal disorder effects up to distant coordination shells. We found that the accuracy of the method strongly depends on the temperature range. The method fails at low temperatures, where quantum effects dominate and MSRD values change only slightly. However, it becomes more accurate at higher temperatures, where the MSRD shows a near-linear dependence on temperature.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological edge states in black phosphorus-like Bi(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the structures and electronic properties of ultra-thin Bi(110) films grown on an s-wave superconductor substrate using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Remarkably, our experimental results validate the theoretical predictions that the manipulation of Bi(110) surface atom buckling can control the topological phase transition. Notably, we have observed robust unreconstructed edge states at the edges of both 3-bilayer (BL) and 4-BL Bi(110) films, with the 4-BL film displaying stronger edge state intensity and a smaller degree of atomic buckling. First-principle calculations further substantiate these findings, demonstrating a gradual reduction in buckling as the film thickness increases, with average height differences between two Bi atoms of approximately 0.19 {\AA}, 0.10 {\AA}, 0.05 {\AA}, and 0.00 {\AA} for the 1-BL, 2-BL, 3-BL, and 4-BL Bi(110) films, respectively. When Bi films are larger than 2 layers, the system changes from a trivial to a non-trivial phase. This research sets the stage for the controlled realization of topological superconductors through the superconducting proximity effect, providing a significant platform for investigating Majorana zero modes and fabricating quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Giant Rabi splitting and polariton photoluminescence in an all solution-deposited dielectric microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar microcavity polaritons have recently emerged as a promising technology for improving several performance characteristics of organic light-emitting diodes, photodiodes and photovoltaics. To form polaritons and achieve enhanced performance, traditional microcavities with high reflectivity mirrors are fabricated by energy-intensive physical vapor deposition methods, which restrict their use in applications requiring flexibility and low cost. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a dielectric all-solution-processed polariton microcavity consisting of Rhodamine 6G films in a poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, exhibiting more than 400 meV Rabi-splitting and photoluminescence with uniform dispersion along the lower polariton mode. Our fully automated deposition and annealing fabrication protocol played a key role in preventing interlayer mixing and producing high optical-quality polariton microcavities, enabling us to observe enhanced scattering of reservoir excitons to the lower polariton and to explore the effects of strong coupling on bimolecular interactions. Notably, we found that polariton microcavities exhibit a more than 10-fold increase in the critical excitation density for bimolecular annihilation compared to bare Rhodamine 6G films. This enhancement can only be partially attributed to the sub-3-fold measured enhancement in radiative lifetime, highlighting the critical role of strong coupling in the influence of molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>In-architecture X-ray assisted C-Br dissociation for on-surface fabrication of diamondoid chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of well-defined, low-dimensional diamondoid-based materials is a promising approach for tailoring diamond properties such as superconductivity. On-surface self-assembly of halogenated diamondoids under ultrahigh vacuum conditions represents an effective strategy in this direction, enabling reactivity exploration and on-surface synthesis approaches. Here we demonstrate through scanning probe microscopy, time-of-flight mass spectrometry and photoelectron spectroscopy, that self-assembled layers of dibromodiamantanes on gold can be debrominated at atomic wavelengths (Al K$\alpha$ at 8.87 $\mathring{A}$ and Mg K$\alpha$ at 9.89 $\mathring{A}$) and low temperatures without affecting their well-defined arrangement. The resulting 'in-architecture' debromination enables the fabrication of diamantane chains from self-assembled precursors in close proximity, which is otherwise inaccessible through annealing on metal surfaces. Our work introduces a novel approach for the fabrication of nanodiamond chains, with significant implications for in-architecture and layer-by-layer synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the extensive work carried out on the epitaxial growth of Ga2O3, a fundamental understanding of the nucleation of its different metastable phases is still lacking. Here we address the role of interface energies by Density Functional Theory calculations of alpha, beta and kappa Ga2O3 on (0001) Al2O3 substrates, and different Ga2O3 interlayers. In conjunction to surface energies and misfit strain contribution, we demonstrate that alpha Ga2O3 is the preferred phase in 2D islands, when the low growth temperatures and the high growth rates hinder 3D island nucleation. This quantitatively explains the phase-locking in Mist-CVD experiments</description>

      <title>Unlocking high hole mobility in diamond over a wide temperature range via efficient shear strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a wide bandgap semiconductor, diamond holds both excellent electrical and thermal properties, making it highly promising in the electrical industry. However, its hole mobility is relatively low and dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, which severely limits further applications. Herein, we proposed that the hole mobility can be efficiently enhanced via slight compressive shear strain along the [100] direction, while the improvement via shear strain along the [111] direction is marginal. This impressive distinction is attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix. The shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the band degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant suppression of interband electron-phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole mobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron scatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons. Remarkably, the in-plane hole mobility of diamond is increased by approximately 800% at 800 K with a 2% compressive shear strain along the [100] direction. The efficient shear strain strategy can be further extended to other semiconductors with face-centered cubic geometry.</description>

      <title>Tuning the properties of metal surfaces by alloying: a DFT study of H2, O2, and H2O adsorption on Ni-Fe surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption and dissociation of H$_2$, O$_2$, and H$_2$O on Ni-Fe alloys with variable Fe:Ni ratio are studied by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. The alloy composition deeply influences the thermochemistry of the adsorption and dissociation processes, with relevant implications to catalysis and electrocatalysis. For large concentration of Fe, the adsorption of H$_2$ is facilitated. On the contrary, O$_2$ is bound more strongly on Ni(111). The dissociation of all three molecules is favourable on all considered supports. However, the O$_2$ and H$_2$O dissociation is more favourable on NiFe alloys compared to Ni, while the dissociation of H$_2$ has a similar thermodynamic profile on pure Ni and Ni$_2$Fe alloy, and is less favourable on NiFe.</description>

      <title>Improved performance of polycrystalline antiferromagnet/ferromagnet stack by nitrogen assisted deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deposition process of the IrMn$_3$/Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$ bilayer of antiferromagnet/ferromagnet (AF/FM) type was modified by introducing a nitrogen additive in argon plasma during the magnetron sputtering of the Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$ layer. This slight modification significantly enhanced the exchange bias energy of the AF/FM bilayer for an IrMn layer thickness ranging from 20{\AA} to 50{\AA} and reduced the coercivity of the FM layer. Calculations indicate that the boost in exchange bias energy and the reduction in coercivity can be attributed to the increased anisotropy energy of the antiferromagnet, resulting in more effective pinning of the ferromagnet by antiferromagnetic grains. The increase in anisotropy is caused by the diffusion of nitrogen from the FM into the AF layer, as established by X-ray diffraction, Neutron Reflectometry, and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism. Our research allows to improve magnetic characteristics of exchange-coupled FM/AF structures through minor modifications in the sputtering process and/or save up to 20% of the costly IrMn$_3$ target by reducing the thickness of the AF layer.</description>

      <title>Artificial sunflower: Light-induced deformation of photoactive shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photomechanically active materials undergo reversible deformation on illumination, making them ideal for remote, tether-free actuation. Much of the work on these materials has focused on one-dimensional structures, such as strips. In this paper, we explore photomechanically active two-dimensional structures such as sheets and shells. When illuminated, such structures undergo spontaneous bending due to the limited penetration of light. However, the geometry of the shell constrains possible deformation modes: changes in Gauss curvature lead to in-plane stretching, against which shells are very stiff. Therefore, there is a complex coupling between the photomechanical actuation and the mechanical behavior of a shell. We develop and implement a novel approach to study photomechananically active shells. This method is a discrete shell model which captures the interplay between actuation, stretching, bending, and geometric changes. Through a series of examples, we explore these complex interactions, demonstrating how one can design shells that deform to follow the source of illumination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a steady progress towards blending 2D quantum materials into technology, with future applications often rooted in the electronic structure. Since crossings and inversions of electronic bands with different orbital characters determine intrinsic quantum transport properties, knowledge of the orbital character is essential. Here, we benchmark angle-resolved photoelectron emission spectroscopy (ARPES) as a tool to experimentally derive orbital characters. For this purpose we study the valence electronic structure of two technologically relevant quantum materials, graphene and WSe$_2$, and focus on circular dichroism that is believed to provide sensitivity to the orbital angular momentum. We analyze the contributions related to angular atomic photoionization profiles, interatomic interference, and multiple scattering. Regimes in which initial-state properties could be disentangled from the ARPES maps are critically discussed and the potential of using circular-dichroic ARPES as a tool to investigate the spin polarization of initial bands is explored. For the purpose of generalization, results from two additional materials, GdMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and PtTe$_2$ are presented in addition. This research demonstrates rich complexity of the underlying physics of circular-dichroic ARPES, providing new insights that will shape the interpretation of both past and future circular-dichroic ARPES studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Superlattice Phase Diagram of Transition Metal Intercalation in Bilayer 2H-TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals hosts intercalated with transition metal (TM) ions exhibit a range of magnetic properties strongly influenced by the structural order of the intercalants. However, predictive computational models for the intercalant ordering phase diagram are lacking, complicating experimental pursuits to target key structural phases. Here we use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to construct a pairwise lattice model and Monte Carlo to determine its associated thermodynamic phase diagram. To circumvent the complexities of modeling magnetic effects, we use the diamagnetic ions Zn$^{2+}$ and Sc$^{3+}$ as computationally accessible proxies for divalent and trivalent species of interest (Fe$^{2+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$), which provide insights into the high-temperature thermodynamic phase diagram well above the paramagnetic transition temperature. We find that electrostatic coupling between intercalants is almost entirely screened, so the pairwise lattice model represents a coarse-grained charge density reorganization about the intercalated sites. The resulting phase diagram reveals that the entropically-favored $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ ordering and coexisting locally ordered $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ and $2 \times 2$ domains persist across a range of temperatures and intercalation densities. This occurs even at quarter filling of interstitial sites (corresponding to bulk stoichiometries of M$_{0.25}$TaS$_2$; M = intercalant ion) where a preference for long-range $2 \times 2$ order is typically assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of 2D and quasi-2D quantum materials one needs to model strain at the level of the Hamiltonian as opposed to a semi-classical approach. Corrections to the electronic Hamiltonian due to strain arise from two sources: deformations of the lattice and changes in the hoppings. Here, we provide a general theory that takes into account the symmetry of the lattice and that of the bonds, and allows us to write down the strain corrections from all sources in any 2D lattice in terms of the band structure parameters like the velocity and the inverse mass tensor. We then use Group theory to identify when strain can be described as a scalar- and/or a vector-potential. We discuss the nature of the potentials that arise from in- and out-of-plane hoppings, allowing us to model multi-layer systems. We also show that, in general, one encounters multiple vector-potentials in different sectors of the Hilbert space, but one can derive a simpler effective low energy strained Hamiltonian via Hilbert space projections. We discuss several toy models of 2D systems and present strained bilayer graphene as a practical system that incorporates all of the above features. We identify a strain dependent energy scale in bilayer graphene above which we would no longer need to account for multiple vector-potentials. The generality of this formulation allows for a wider range of materials to be investigated for quantum transport straintronics.</description>

      <title>Tunneling current-controlled spin states in few-layer van der Waals magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective control of magnetic phases in two-dimensional magnets would constitute crucial progress in spintronics, holding great potential for future computing technologies. Here, we report a new approach of leveraging tunneling current as a tool for controlling spin states in CrI3. We reveal that a tunneling current can deterministically switch between spin-parallel and spin-antiparallel states in few-layer CrI3, depending on the polarity and amplitude of the current. We propose a mechanism involving nonequilibrium spin accumulation in the graphene electrodes in contact with the CrI3 layers. We further demonstrate tunneling current-tunable stochastic switching between multiple spin states of the CrI3 tunnel devices, which goes beyond conventional bi-stable stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions and has not been documented in two-dimensional magnets. Our findings not only address the existing knowledge gap concerning the influence of tunneling currents in controlling the magnetism in two-dimensional magnets, but also unlock possibilities for energy-efficient probabilistic and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayers Janus MAA'Z$_x$Z'$_{(4-x)}$ family</title>

Abstract: The Rashba effect and nontrivial topology related to spintronics are receiving increasing attention. However, there are no clear, effective and universal rules for finding Rashba semiconductors and nontrivial topological insulators (TIs). Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of the MAA'Z$_x$Z'$_{(4-x)}$ systems obtained through comprehensive Janus structural design based on the MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) family. In the process of doping these materials with different Janus configurations, the bandgap decreases continuously with the enhancement of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength, and ideal isolated Rashba splitting occurs at the conduction-band minimum (CBM) of multiple materials. It is found that the generation and strength of Rashba splitting are closely related to orbital contribution and charge transfer. Further doping with heavy elements, the material appears to open the bandgap and invert the bands when considering SOC, exhibiting nontrivial TIs features. In addition, the pz orbitals appearing in the valence band after band inversion cause special Rashba splitting at the VBM of multiple materials. Importantly, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states, and hybridized spin textures in the MAA'Z$_x$Z'$_{(4-x)}$ systems can be significantly tuned through biaxial strain. Our work not only comprehensively investigates the MAA'Z$_x$Z'$_{(4-x)}$ systems with multifunctional application prospects, but also identifies the mechanisms and principles of Rashba effect and nontrivial topology in Janus materials.</description>

Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.</description>

      <title>Approaches to tunnel magnetoresistance effect with antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is one of the representative phenomena in spintronics. Ferromagnets, which have a net spin polarization, have been utilized for the TMR effect. Recently, by contrast, the TMR effect with antiferromagnets, which do not possess a macroscopic spin polarization, has been proposed, and also been observed in experiments. In this topical review, we discuss recent developments in the TMR effect, particularly focusing on the TMR effect with antiferromagnets. First, we review how the TMR effect can occur in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. The Julliere model, which has been conventionally utilized to grasp the TMR effect with ferromagnets, breaks down for the antiferromagnetic TMR effect. Instead, we see that the momentum dependent spin splitting explains the antiferromagnetic TMR effect. After that, we revisit the TMR effect from viewpoint of the local density of states (LDOS). We particularly focus on the LDOS inside the barrier, and show that the product of the LDOS will qualitatively capture the TMR effect not only in the ferromagnetic tunnel junctions but also in the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This method is expected to work usefully for designing magnetic tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent $GW$+EDMFT for semiconductors and insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies of semiconductors and band insulators are usually based on variants of the $GW$ method without full self-consistency, like single-shot $G^0W^0$ or quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$. Fully self-consistent $GW$ provides a poor description of the gap size and electronic structure due to the lack of vertex corrections. While it is hard to predict at which order corrections can be neglected, local vertex corrections to all orders can be consistently included by combining $GW$ with extended dynamical mean field theory (EDMFT). Here, we show that {\it ab initio} multitier $GW$+EDMFT calculations, which achieve full self-consistency in a suitably defined low-energy space, provide a remarkably accurate description of semiconductors and band insulators. Our results imply that despite the weak correlations, local vertex corrections are essential for a consistent treatment of this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Room-Temperature Ferroelectricity in Metal Oxide Monolayers for Advanced Logic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectric materials are beneficial for power-efficient memory devices and transistor applications. Here, we predict out-of-plane ferroelectricity in a new family of buckled metal oxide (MO; M: Ge, Sn, Pb) monolayers with significant spontaneous polarization. Additionally, these monolayers have a narrow valence band, which is energetically separated from the rest of the low-lying valence bands. Such a unique band structure limits the long thermal tail of the hot carriers, mitigating subthreshold thermionic leakage and allowing field-effect transistors (FETs) to function beyond the bounds imposed on conventional FETs by thermodynamics. Our quantum transport simulations reveal that the FETs based on these MO monolayers exhibit a large ON/OFF ratio with an average subthreshold swing of less than 60 mV/decade at room temperature, even for short gate lengths. Our work motivates further exploration of the MO monolayers for developing advanced, high-performance memory and logic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nematic quantum fluids appear in strongly interacting systems and break the rotational symmetry of the crystallographic lattice. In metals, this is connected to a well-known instability of the Fermi liquid-the Pomeranchuk instability. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we identified this instability in a highly unusual setting: on the surface of an elemental topological metal, arsenic. By directly visualizing the Fermi surface of the surface state via scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, we find that the Fermi surface gets deformed and becomes elliptical at the energies where the nematic state is present. Known instances of nematic instability typically need van-Hove singularities or multi-orbital physics as drivers. In contrast, the surface states of arsenic are essentially indistinguishable from well-confined isotropic Rashba bands near the Fermi level, rendering our finding the first realization of Pomeranchuk instability of the topological surface state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ferromagnetic systems lacking inversion symmetry, an applied electric field can control the ferromagnetic order parameters through the spin-orbit torque. The prototypical example is a bilayer heterostructure composed of a ferromagnet and a heavy metal that acts as a spin current source. In addition to such bilayers, spin-orbit coupling can mediate spin-orbit torques in ferromagnets that lack bulk inversion symmetry. A recently discovered example is the two-dimensional monolayer ferromagnet $Fe_3GeTe_2$. In this work, we use first-principles calculations to study the spin-orbit torque and ensuing magnetic dynamics in this material. By expanding the torque versus magnetization direction as a series of vector spherical harmonics, we find that higher order terms (up to $\ell=4$) are significant and play important roles in the magnetic dynamics. They give rise to deterministic, magnetic field-free electrical switching of perpendicular magnetization.</description>

Recently, it was reported to be an altermagnet, containing bands with momentum-dependent spin splitting; time-resolved experimental probes of MnTe are therefore important both for understanding novel magnetic properties and potential device applications. We investigate ultrafast spin dynamics in epitaxial MnTe(001)/InP(111) thin films using pump-probe magneto-optical measurements in the Kerr configuration. At room temperature, we observe an oscillation mode at 55 GHz that does not appear at zero magnetic field. Combining field and polarization dependence, we identify this mode as a magnon, likely originating from inverse stimulated Raman scattering. Magnetic field-dependent oscillations persist up to at least 335 K, which could reflect coupling to known short-range magnetic order in MnTe above $T_N$. Additionally, we observe two optical phonons at 3.6 THz and 4.2 THz, which broaden and redshift with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Spin Centers in Photocatalytic Metal-Organic Framework UiO-66</title>

Abstract: Metal-Organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for advanced photocatalytically active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large active surface areas and structural tunability and are thus highly competitive with oxides, the well-established material class for photocatalysis. However, due to their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic processes in MOFs are still not well understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (trPL), the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation are investigated, as well as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. A manifold of photoinduced electron spin centers is detected, which is subsequently analyzed and identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Under UV illumination, the symmetry, g-tensors and lifetimes of three distinct contributions are revealed: a surface O2-radical, a light-induced electron-hole pair, and a triplet exciton. Notably, the latter was found to emit (delayed) fluorescence. Our findings provide new insights into the photoinduced charge transfer processes, which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage for further studies on photogenerated spin centers in this and similar MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state dislocation creep of olivine controlled by dislocation interactions at the isostress endmember</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rheological behaviour of olivine deforming by dislocation creep controls geodynamic processes that involve steady-state flow or transient viscosity evolution. Longstanding rheological models applied to both contexts assume that dislocation creep of olivine aggregates occurs close to the isostrain endmember with each grain deforming to the same strain but supporting different stress. Here, we test this assumption by constructing isostrain and isostress models based on flow laws for single crystals and comparing them to rheological data for aggregates. This analysis reveals that strain rates measured on olivine aggregates agree with those predicted by the isostress model but are an order of magnitude faster than those predicted by the isostrain model. When extrapolated to conditions typical of the shallow upper mantle, the isostress model predicts steady-state viscosities that are one to three orders of magnitude less than those predicted by the isostrain model. Furthermore, deformation close to the isostress endmember implies that transient creep occurs predominantly by dislocation interactions, suggesting viscosity changes that are approximately one order of magnitude greater than those predicted previously based on grain interactions associated with the isostrain model.</description>

      <title>Electrically-driven control of nanoscale chemical changes in amorphous complex oxide memristive devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study demonstrates that strong cationic segregation can occur in amorphous complex oxide memristors during electrical operation. With the help of analytic techniques, we observed that switching the electrical stimulation from voltage to current significantly prevents structural changes and cation segregation at the nanoscale, improving also the device cycle-to-cycle variability. These findings could contribute to the design of more reliable oxide-based memristors and underscore the crucial effect that has the type of electrical stimulation applied to the devices on their integrity and reliability.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior and giant field-enhancement of the thermal conductivity in the honeycomb antiferromagnet BaCo2(AsO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The layered honeycomb material BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO) is of topical interest because its magnetic state is related to that of the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using thermal transport to probe how magnetic excitations interact with phonons in the magnetically disordered regime, we have uncovered an unusually large enhancement of the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ in an in-plane magnetic field ${\bf H}$. Just above the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$, a field of 13 T increases $\kappa_{xx}$ by a factor $\sim 211$, much larger than reported previously in any magnetic insulator. Interestingly, $\kappa_{xx}(H,T)$ exhibits a scaling behavior in the entire magnetically disordered region that surrounds the ordered zigzag state. The ratio $\Delta \kappa_{xx}(H,T)/\kappa_{xx}(13,T)$, measured throughout the disordered region, collapses to a one-parameter scaling function ${\rm exp}(-1/gx)$ (where $x = \mu_{\rm B}B/k_{\rm B}T$ and $g$ is a constant).</description>

      <title>Theory of excitonic order in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that kagome metals can feature an excitonic condensate of unconventional nature. Studying the recently discovered variant ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, we identify electron and hole pockets due to a pair of van Hove singularities (vHS) close to the Fermi level, with an approximate spectral particle-hole symmetry at low energies. A significant fraction of the Fermi level density of states away from the vHS is removed by the onset of high temperature charge density wave order, and makes the bands more two dimensional, setting the stage for the formation of excitons. We develop a two-orbital minimal model which captures these features, along with the sublattice support of the wavefunctions, and find $s$-wave or $d$-wave excitons depending on the microscopic interaction parameters -- the latter of which exhibits either a charge nematic or time-reversal symmetry breaking flux order depending on strain, offering an explanation of recent STM and transport experiments. The appearance of particle-type and hole-type vHS, and the excitonic resonance associated with it, may be a common thread to understanding nematicity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Crystalline electric field excitations and their nonlinear splitting under magnetic fields in YbOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently reported van der Waals layered honeycomb rare-earth chalcohalides REChX (RE = rare earth, Ch = chalcogen, and X = halogen) are considered to be promising Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) candidates. The high-quality single crystals of YbOCl, a representative member of the family with an effective spin of 1/2, are available now. The crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations in a rare-earth spin system are fundamentally important for understanding both finite-temperature and ground-state magnetism, but remain unexplored in YbOCl so far. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive Raman scattering study to unambiguously identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl and determine the CEF parameters and wave functions. Our Raman experiments further reveal the anomalous nonlinear CEF splitting under magnetic fields. We have grown single crystals of YbOCl, the nonmagnetic LuOCl, and the diluted magnetic Lu_{0.86}Yb_{0.14}OCl to make a completely comparative investigation. Polarized Raman spectra on the samples at 1.8 K allow us to clearly assign all the Raman-active phonon modes and explicitly identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl. The CEF excitations are further examined using temperature-dependent Raman measurements and careful symmetry analysis based on Raman tensors related to CEF excitations. By applying the CEF Hamiltonian to the experimentally determined CEF excitations, we extract the CEF parameters and eventually determine the CEF wave functions. The study experimentally pins down the CEF excitations in the Kitaev compound YbOCl and sets a foundation for understanding its finite-temperature magnetism and exploring the possible nontrivial spin ground state.</description>
