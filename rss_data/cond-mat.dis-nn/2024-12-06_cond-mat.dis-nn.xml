      <title>An Interacting Particle System Interpretation of Free Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of the sum of large random matrices that are mutually "free", i.e. randomly rotated, can be obtained using the formalism of R-transforms, with many applications in different fields. We provide a direct interpretation of the otherwise abstract additivity property of R-transforms for the sum in terms of a deterministic dynamical evolution of "particles" (the eigenvalues), interacting through two-body and higher-body forces, generalizing the usual Coulomb interaction. We extend our result to product of free matrices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spectrum in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectra of particles in disordered lattices can either be completely extended or localized or can be intermediate which hosts both the localized and extended states separated from each other. In this work, however, we show that in the case of a one dimensional lattice with long-range hopping and non-Hermitian quasiperiodic onsite potential, the localized and extended states in the spectrum are intermixed with each other rather than well separated. As a result, an atypical intermediate phase appears where consecutive pairs of extended states intermittently appear in the pool of localized states. We also argue that such anomalous spectral intermixing can be realized in the short-range hopping limit by appropriate engineering of the onsite potential. Moreover, we obtain that the nature of the spectrum also reveals non-standard scenarios in the complex energy plane where the complex energies encircle real ones. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between the non-Hermiticity and quasiperiodic disorder in the system.</description>

      <title>PDMD: Potential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics for Variable-sized Water Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches, such as ab initio MD and empirical force field MD, face significant trade-offs between physical accuracy and computational efficiency. This work presents a novel Potential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics (PDMD) framework for predicting system energy and atomic forces of variable-sized water clusters. Specifically, PDMD employs the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to generate high-dimensional, equivariant features before leveraging ChemGNN, a graph neural network model that adaptively learns the atomic chemical environments without requiring a priori knowledge. Through an iterative self-consistent training approach, the converged PDMD achieves a mean absolute error of 7.1 meV/atom for energy and 59.8 meV/angstrom for forces, outperforming the state-of-the-art DeepMD by ~80% in energy accuracy and ~200% in force prediction. As a result, PDMD can reproduce the ab initio MD properties of water clusters at a tiny fraction of its computational cost. These results demonstrate that the proposed PDMD offers multiple-phase predictive power, enabling ultra-fast, general-purpose MD simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learning in Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>
