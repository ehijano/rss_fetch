      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic bonding is an essential feature of many soft materials. Molecular simulations have proven to be a powerful tool for modeling bonding kinetics and thermodynamics in these materials, providing insights into their properties that cannot be obtained by experiments alone. Here, we review recent advances in modeling dynamic bonding in soft matter via molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and hybrid simulation methods, highlighting outstanding challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>Patchy Particles Design: From Floppy Modes to Sloppy Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patchy particles have proven to be a prominent model for studying the self-assembly behavior of various systems, ranging from finite clusters to bulk crystal assemblies, and from synthetic colloidal particles to viruses. The patchy particle model is flexible, but it also comes with its own pitfalls -- the potential design space is infinite. Many efforts have been put into building inverse-design frameworks that efficiently design patchy particles for targeted assembly behaviors. In contrast, little work has been done on investigating the interplay between different types of parameters that can be optimized for patchy particles, such as patch location, patch size, and patch binding energies. Here, by utilizing molecular dynamics with automatic differentiation, we elucidate the relationships between different potential optimization parameters and provide general guidelines on how to approach patchy particle design for various types of finite clusters. Specifically, we find that the design parameter landscape is highly dependent on the floppiness of the target structure, and we can identify stiff and sloppy parameters by computing the Hessians of all optimization parameters.</description>

      <title>Active Rosensweig Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrofluids, colloidal dispersions of magnetic nanoparticles, are renowned for pattern formation like few other materials. The Rosensweig instability of a horizontal ferrofluid-air interface in perpendicular magnetic field is especially well known classically, this instability sets the air-ferrofluid interface into an array of spikes that correspond to a new free energy minimum of the system. However, once the pattern is formed, it does not exhibit any notable thermal or non-equilibrium fluctuations, i.e., it is passive. In this work, we present an active version of the Rosensweig patterns. We realize them experimentally by driving a dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles with an electric field into a non-equilibrium gradient state and by inducing the instability using a magnetic field. The coupling of electric and magnetic forcing leads to patterns that can be adjusted from quiescent classic Rosensweig-like behavior (at low activity) to highly dynamic ones displaying peak and defect dynamics, as well as tunability of structure periodicities beyond what is possible in the classic systems (at high activity). We analyze the results using an active agent-based approach as well as a continuum perspective. We construct a simple equilibrium-like effective Rosensweig model to describe the onset of the patterns and propose a minimal Swift-Hohenberg type model capturing the essential active pattern dynamics. Our results suggest that classic continuum systems exhibiting pattern formation can be activated to display life-inspired non-equilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Fourier-Tschebyshev Representations of the First Normal Stress Difference in Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) is a key technique for characterizing nonlinear viscoelasticity in a wide range of materials. Most research to date has focused on the shear stress response to an oscillatory strain input. However, for highly elastic materials such as polymer melts, the time-varying first normal stress difference $N_1(t;\omega,\gamma_0)$ can become much larger than the shear stress at sufficiently large strains, serving as a sensitive probe of the material's nonlinear characteristics. We present a Fourier-Tschebyshev framework for decomposing the higher-order spectral content of the $N_1$ material functions generated in LAOS. This new decomposition is first illustrated through analysis of the second-order and fourth-order responses of the quasilinear Upper Convected Maxwell model and the fully nonlinear Giesekus model. We then use this new framework to analyze experimental data on a viscoelastic silicone polymer and a thermoplastic polyurethane melt. Furthermore, we couple this decomposition with the recently developed Gaborheometry strain sweep technique to enable rapid and quantitative determination of the $N_1$ material function from experimental normal force data obtained in a single sweep from small to large strain amplitudes. We verify that asymptotic connections between the oscillatory shear stress and $N_1$ in the quasilinear limit are satisfied for the experimental data, ensuring self-consistency. This framework for analyzing the first normal stress difference is complementary to the established framework for analyzing the shear stresses in LAOS, and augments the content of material-specific data sets, hence more fully quantifying the important nonlinear viscoelastic properties of a wide range of soft materials.</description>

      <title>Acoustic transparency in dense granular suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a frequency band exhibiting acoustic transparency in 2D and 3D dense granular suspensions, enabling the transmission of a low-frequency ballistic wave excited by a high-frequency broadband ultrasound pulse. This phenomenon is attributed to spatial correlations in the structural disorder of the medium. To support this interpretation, we use an existing model that incorporates such correlations via the structure factor. Its predictions are shown to agree well with those of the Generalized Coherent Potential Approximation (GCPA) model, which is known to apply at high volume fractions, including the close packing limit, but does not explicitly account for disorder correlation. Within the transparency band, attenuation is found to be dominated by absorption rather than scattering. Measurements of the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient reveal significant deviations from conventional models, challenging the current understanding of acoustic absorption in dense granular media.</description>

      <title>Toggling stiffness via multistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials enable unconventional and programmable mechanical responses through structural design rather than material composition. In this work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems in soft robotics and smart structures.</description>

      <title>Collective Variables Based on Multipole Expansion of Ewald Summation for Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallization, a fundamental phase transition process governing material formation in natural and industrial contexts, involves the spontaneous emergence of long-range structural order from disordered phases. This long-range periodicity involves spatial and molecular orientation order. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of crystallization require collective variables (CVs) that accurately distinguish this long-\range periodicity. Existing CVs based on local descriptors (e.g., bond-orientational order) often lack transferability across crystal structures. To address this, we propose a unified CV framework derived from the multipole expansion of Ewald summation: a mathematical formalism bridging X-ray diffraction (XRD) principles and electrostatic energy computation in MD. By projecting atomic configurations onto a basis of spherical harmonics (complete for angular function representation), our CV achieves high-fidelity encoding of both translational and orientational order. Metadynamics simulations demonstrate that this CV drives efficient sampling of polymorphic pathways for known crystals and predicts stable phases even without crystal structures. This approach shows potential as a transferable platform for ab initio crystal structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Simulating active agents under confinement with Dissipative Particles (hydro)Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study active agents embedded in bulk or in confinement explicitly considering hydrodynamics and simulating the swimmers via an implementation inspired by the squirmer model. We develop a Dissipative Particle Dynamics scheme for the solvent. This approach allows us to properly deal not only with hydrodynamics but also with thermal fluctuations. On the other side, this approach enables us to study active agents with complex shapes, ranging from spherical colloids to polymers. To start with, we study a simple spherical colloid. We analyze the features of the velocity fields of the surrounding solvent, when the colloid is a pusher, a puller or a neutral swimmer either in bulk or confined in a cylindrical channel. Next, we characterise its dynamical behaviour by computing the mean square displacement and the long time diffusion when the active colloid is in bulk or in a channel (varying its radius) and analyze the orientation autocorrelation function in the latter case. While the three studied squirmer types are characterised by the same bulk diffusion, the cylindrical confinement considerably modulates the diffusion and the orientation autocorrelation function. Finally, we focus our attention on a more complex shape: an active polymer. We first characterise the structural features computing its radius of gyration when in bulk or in cylindrical confinement, and compare to known results obtained without hydrodynamics. Next, we characterise the dynamical behaviour of the active polymer by computing its mean square displacement and the long time diffusion. On the one hand, both diffusion and radius of gyration decrease due to the hydrodynamic interaction when the system is in bulk. On the other hand, the effect of confinement is to decrease the radius of gyration, disturbing the motion of the polymer and thus reducing its diffusion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the access conductance of a nanopore in a charged membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--H\"uckel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Models for Two Nonreciprocally Coupled Fields: A Microscopic Derivation for Zero, One, and Two Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for several cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. Only allowing for single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, only accounting for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Moreover, combining the different dynamics gives a large number of further models. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>
