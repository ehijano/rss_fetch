      <title>Exactly solvable topological phase transition in a quantum dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $\alpha$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $\alpha=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($\alpha&lt;3$) to a columnar ordered state ($\alpha&gt;3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $\xi\propto1/|\alpha-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Theory of Next-Generation Even-Denominator States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even-denominator quantum Hall states are leading candidates for realizing non-Abelian topological orders, with the $\nu=\frac{5}{2}$ plateau in GaAs the first and most-studied example. Recent experiments in GaAs and bilayer graphene (BLG) have observed many `next-generation' even-denominator states at filling factors such as $\nu=\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{3}{8}$, and $\frac{3}{10}$. We develop the theory of these states, including analyses of their bulk quasiparticles, of methods for distinguishing between pairing channels in edge transport measurements, and of their trial wavefunctions. As part of this study, we derive general relations of how flux attachment affects many universal properties of states. In particular, we prove that the topological stability of interface modes is invariant under flux attachment. We compare next-generation paired states to Bonderson-Slingerland states at the same filling factors, and demonstrate that their quasiparticles carry identical charges and obey the same exchange statistics. The next-generation and Bonderson-Slingerland states still describe distinct phases, and we find that the former are energetically favored in the lowest Landau level, while the latter are favored in the first excited level.</description>

      <title>Spin reorientations in structurally metastable, disordered, and hexagonal Cr7Te8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vapor deposited two-dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ displays unusual temperature dependent Hall effect properties, including a room temperature anomalous Hall effect, sign reversals of the Hall resistivity on cooling, and a peak in the Hall resistivity at low temperatures. The two dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ heterostructures that form the basis of these measurements are hexagonal in structure. We study the magnetic and structural properties of bulk Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ synthesized by quenching from 1000 $^{\circ}$C with the goal of relating the magnetic, structural, and electronic properties. This quenched phase is metastable, hexagonal, and displays different magnetic properties from the slow-cooled and more thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase. High-resolution x-ray diffraction of the quenched hexagonal phase finds a first-order transition to a lower symmetry monoclinic phase on \textit{heating} above $\sim$ 550 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of the quenched hexagonal phase reveal ferromagnetic ordering above room temperature, along with the two distinct transitions at $\sim$ 220~K and $\sim$ 70~K. Through neutron diffraction studies, we find the $\sim$ 220 K anomaly is a spin reorientation transition of the ferromagnetically aligned magnetic moments and the $\sim70$ K feature represents a transition from a high temperature ferromagnet to a low temperature antiferromagnet. We suggest that these magnetic transitions are related to changes in the unit cell dimensions and are connected to the temperature dependent Hall resisitivity studied in two-dimensional heterostructures. This implies a link between structural, magnetic, and electronic properties in the ``pseudo" two-dimensional chromium tellurides.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic coupling at the field-induced transition in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelastic coupling plays a crucial role in magnetic-field-induced transitions in anisotropic ferromagnets. Ultrasonic methods are suitable for experimental investigations of these phenomena. We investigate elastic constants in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$, a quasi-two-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnet, by measuring sound velocity in magnetic fields perpendicular to spontaneous magnetization. The shear modulus $C_{44}$ exhibits dramatic softening at the field-induced transition from the ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase with magnetic moments forced to polarize along the applied transverse field. The softening is attributed to strong magnetic fluctuations near a second-order phase transition. Theoretical calculations based on magnetization data qualitatively reproduced the observed behavior within a strain-exchange mechanism. These results demonstrate that magnetoelastic coupling in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$ arises primarily from exchange striction and provide a framework for modeling similar transitions in other anisotropic ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>The role of the apical oxygen in cuprate high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements exploiting the natural superstructure modulation of the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) have revealed a possible correlation between the Cu-apical-O distance $\delta_{\mathrm{api}}$ and the superconducting order parameter $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$, as reported recently by O'Mahony et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2207449119 (2022)). These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity. Using a combination of density-functional theory and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we compute from first principles the variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ induced solely by apical oxygen displacement in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$, Bi-2212, and HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. The quantitative agreement between our calculations and experiments allows us to unambiguously attribute the observed variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ to changes in $\delta_{\mathrm{api}}$. We demonstrate, however, that these variations of $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ originate predominantly from changes in the effective hole-doping of the CuO$_2$ planes, with negligible effect on the charge-transfer gap. The modest magnitude of the $m_{\mathrm{SC}}$ modulation induced by apical-oxygen displacement alone therefore warrants caution in interpreting correlations between $T_c$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{api}}$ inferred from comparisons across different cuprate compounds.</description>

      <title>Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin orders in the t-U-V-J model: a slave-spin-1 approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated fermion systems on a lattice have been a subject of intense focus in the field of condensed-matter physics. These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.</description>

      <title>Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Field-Effect Three-Terminal Electronic Device with an Electron Mobility Exceeding 40 Million cm^2/(Vs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.</description>

      <title>Modulation of superconducting properties by the charge density wave at the surface of 2H-NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, we performed ultralow-temperature spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on the cleaved surface of the layered superconductor 2H-NbSe2. We found that the superconducting-gap spectrum exhibits intricate structures reflecting the anisotropic gaps opening on multiple Fermi surfaces. Notably, none of the characteristic energy scales apparent in the spectral gap show appreciable spatial variations, suggesting that the finite-momentum pairing is negligible. Instead, the spectral weight near the coherence peak is modulated with the same periodicity as the CDW. The maximum position of the coherence-peak-weight modulation coincides with neither the peak nor the bottom of the CDW modulation; rather, it aligns with the center of one of the two inequivalent triangular plaquettes that comprise the CDW unit cell. This distribution pattern of Bogoliubov quasiparticles directly results from the broken in-plane inversion symmetry at the surface of 2H-NbSe2, which may activate Ising spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Systematic Magnetic Structure Generation Based on Oriented Spin Space Groups: Formulation, Applications, and High-Throughput First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Charge Stripes and Majorana Zero Modes in An Iron-Based Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Topological Semimetal Transport Modulated by Interstitial Fe in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+\delta}As$_2$ Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are renowned for exhibiting large, unsaturated magnetoresistance arising from ultrahigh carrier mobility and electron-hole compensation. However, such behaviors remain poorly understood in iron-based superconductors that have been recently recognized to harbor rich nontrivial topology. Here, we combine angle-resolved magneto-transport measurements with first principles calculations to reveal the emergence and tunability of topological semimetals in ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+\delta}As$_2$ epitaxial films, modulated by interstitial Fe. These states exhibit ultralow residual resistivity, coexisting high-mobility electron and hole carriers, and linear positive magnetoresistance below 110 K. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance becomes more pronounced when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the film plane, reaching an unsaturated 1206% at 56 T. Furthermore, superconductivity persists in these ferropnictide films, establishing them as a tunable platform for investigating the interplay among electron correlation, topology, and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Physical and Dielectric Properties of Polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and dielectric properties of polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$ samples, prepared at two sintering temperatures (1000\degree C and 1250\degree C). The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\% and 96\% for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($\epsilon$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C.</description>

      <title>High-resolution neutron diffraction determination of noncollinear antiferromagnetic order in the honeycomb magnetoelectric Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$</title>

Abstract: Magnetoelectric systems offer potential for device applications exploiting coupled states between electric and magnetic properties. Among magnetoelectric materials, \FNO has attracted special attention because of its pronounced dielectric signal at high magnetic transition temperatures. However, the magnetic ground state, which is essential information for understanding its unusual magnetoelectricity, remains unclarified. Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K. This study provides insights into the understanding of its magnetoelectric properties.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the exact equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy can be obtained from the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CC and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and uncover exotic universal features from a systematic investigation. In particular, we show that for generic bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians, the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding of hard-core bosonic zero modes. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by a nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with and without the aid of a controlled defect, respectively. Analytic and numerical results are given. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to observe these predictions and identify the parameter regimes for the high-fidelity braiding, paving the way for the experimental observation of our results in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-tuned magnetic order and metamagnetic criticality in non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements performed on single crystals of non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$, Au deficiency 18$\%$, a strongly correlated antiferromagnet with N\'eel temperature T$_N$ = 13.2 K. Field-dependent magnetization measurements reveal a large magnetic anisotropy at low temperatures with an easy axis along the crystallographic c-axis, in which direction a spin-flop transition exhibits strong features in magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity at H$_c$ = 75 kOe. The constructed temperature-field phase diagram connects this transition to the suppression of magnetic order, which evolves from a second-order nature into a first-order transition that bifurcates at the spin-flop into three transitions below 1 K. The smoothed nature of the metamagnetic transitions in non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$ is well described by an Ising model with weak quenched disorder, suggesting that the presence of Au vacancies is sufficient to smear the complex metamagnetic behavior and tune the critical behavior of magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Type and Laughlin-Type Argument for the Quantum Hall Effect in Lattice Fermions with Spiral Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the condition for the occurrence of the integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems with interactions, expressed as $\phi\nu-\rho\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $\phi$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly with redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be systematically controlled by a factor of the system size.</description>

      <title>Duality between open systems and closed bilayer systems: Thermofield double states as quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a duality between open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation and satisfying the detailed balance condition on the one side, and closed bilayer systems with a self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the other side. Under this duality, the identity operator on the open system side maps to a quantum many-body scar of the dual Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$. This scar eigenstate has a form of a thermofield double state for a single-body conserved quantity entering the detailed balance conditions. A remarkable feature of this thermofield scar is a tunable single-layer entanglement entropy controlled by the reservoir temperature on the open system side. Further, we identify broad classes of many-body open systems with nontrivial explicit eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperator. The expectation values of the corresponding observables exhibit a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Under the above duality, these eigen operators give rise to additional (towers of) scars. Finally, we point out that more general superoperators (not necessarily of the GKSL form) can be mapped to self-adjoint Hamiltonians of bilayer systems harbouring scars, and provide an example thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Haldane phase with local SU(3) adjoint representation constitutes the simplest non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases in the SU($N&gt;2$) Heisenberg spin chains. In this paper, we propose to realize this phase by a two-species spinor Bose gas, with each species labeling the quark or antiquark states of SU(3) symmetry. In the strong-coupling limit, we determine the ground-state phase diagram, and identify a quantum phase transition from the Haldane phase to a dimer phase. We show how to characterize the Haldane phase through its edge excitations. We also explain the physics at the dimer phase, by constructing an explicit ground-state ansatz at the dimer point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent experiment [Cohen et al., Science 382, 542 (2023)] observed a robustly quantized $e^2/2h$ conductance in a quantum point contact between fractional quantum Hall edges (a quantum Hall transformer), which then vanishes at low temperature. While this behavior can be described by a boundary sine gordon (BSG) model derived from electron tunneling, the microscopic motivation for such strong tunneling is unclear. We use an alternative model based on sliding charge density waves and a density inhomogeneity to clarify the BSG description and calculate the conductance over the full range of transmission. Using a perturbative method and a matrix product state calculation, we draw a quantitative connection between the BSG model and the physical quantum Hall system.</description>

      <title>Vestigial Gapless Boson Density Wave Emerging between $\nu = 1/2$ Fractional Chern Insulator and Finite-Momentum Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.</description>

      <title>Effect of interatomic repulsion and quasi-degenerate states on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Universal Phase Transitions of Matter in Optically Driven Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside them. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new nonequilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal steplike structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that redshifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this steplike potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is redshifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a dirty superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity that includes all cavity modes, we construct the nonequilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>

Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced damping of spin excitations in Cr-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00242</link>

Abstract: In doped Hund's metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and chemical pressure are often considered the dominant factors. Partial chemical substitution, however, inevitably introduces disorder. Here, we investigate spin excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and $ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened and damped, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show increased electronic localization and a suppression of the nematic $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ band splitting present in the parent compound. We thus propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. Our findings reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a Hund's metal.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations</title>

Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 8,422 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 30 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.</description>
