      <title>Cochain complexes over a functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose unifying the categories of cochain complexes $\text{Ch}(\mathcal{C})$ and modules $\widehat{A}\text{-mod}$ over a repetitive algebra $\widehat{A}$. Motivated by their striking similarities and importance, we introduce a novel category encompassing both. Our analysis explores key properties of this unified category, highlighting its parallels and divergences from the original structures. We study whether it preserves crucial aspects like limits, colimits, products, coproducts, and abelianity. Besides, we establish a family of projective and injective indecomposable objects within this framework. Moving beyond theoretical foundations, we examine the influence and interaction over these novel categories of the category of endofunctors and its monoidal structure. Finally, we explore the implications of our constructions over representation theory of algebras and algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Triangulated structure for Bondarenko's Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V. Bondarenko and Y. Drozd gives a description of all indecomposable objects in a category of representations of posets, nowadays known as the Bondarenko's category. This category was essential for V. Bekkert and H. Merklen classify all indecomposable objects of the derived category of gentle algebras. In view of this connection with the derived category, which possess a triangulated structure, and of the fact that in this paper we show that the Bondarenko's category is not an abelian category, it is reasonable to contemplate the existence of a triangulated structure for the Bondarenko's category.
  In this paper we introduce a triangulated category structure over a quotient of Bondarenko's category, which will allow to use the techniques of triangulated category to study representations of posets.</description>

      <title>Action of the relative Weyl group on partial Springer sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the Springer correspondence, the Weyl group action on the Springer sheaf can be defined in two ways: via restriction or the Fourier transform. It is well-known that these two actions differ by the sign character. This was proven by Hotta for sheaves with characteristic 0 coefficients in 1981, and more recently extended to arbitrary coefficients by Achar, Henderson, Juteau, and Riche in 2014. In this short article, we study an extension of this problem to the partial Springer sheaf with arbitrary field coefficients. This involves an action of the so-called relative Weyl group $W(L)$.</description>

      <title>Effective codescent morphisms of $n$-quasigroups and $n$-loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective codescent morphisms of $n$-quasigroups and of $n$-loops are characterized. To this end, it is proved that, for any $n\geq 1$, every codescent morphism of $n$-quasigroups (resp. $n$-loops) is effective. This statement generalizes our earlier results on qusigroups and loops. Moreover, it is shown that the elements of the amalgamated free products of $n$-quasigroups (resp. $n$-loops) have unique normal forms, and that the varieties of $n$-quasigroups and $n$-loops satisfy the strong amalgamation property. The latter two statements generalize the corresponding old results on quasigroups and loops by Evans.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <title>The category of necklaces is Reedy monoidal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this note we further the study of the interactions between Reedy and monoidal structures on a small category, building upon the work of Barwick. We define a Reedy monoidal category as a Reedy category $\mathcal{R}$ which is monoidal such that for all symmetric monoidal model categories $\textbf{A}$, the category $\mathrm{Fun}\left(\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{op}}, \textbf{A}\right)_{\mathrm{Reedy}}$ is model monoidal when equipped with the Day convolution. In the second part, we study the category $\mathcal{N}ec$ of necklaces, as defined by Baues and Dugger-Spivak. Making use of the combinatorial description present in arXiv:2302.02484v1, we streamline some proofs from the literature, and finally show that $\mathcal{N}ec$ is simple Reedy monoidal.</description>
