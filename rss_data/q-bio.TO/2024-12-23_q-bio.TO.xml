      <title>Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic morphogen gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. In a simple scenario, we recently showed that active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the boundary-imposed gradient of a scalar field, which represents, e.g., a morphogen gradient in a developing embryo. Here, we discuss a more realistic scenario, where the morphogen is produced by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with our earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is stable in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the gradient, but it is unstable in the gradient-contractile case. In addition, we now show that gradient-contractile tissues can not be stabilized even by morphogen diffusion. Finally, we point out the existence of an additional instability, which results from the interplay of tissue shear and morphogen diffusion. Our theoretical results explain the lack of gradient-contractile tissues in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.</description>

      <title>Active morphogenesis of patterned epithelial shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape transformations of epithelial tissues in three dimensions, which are crucial for embryonic development or in vitro organoid growth, can result from active forces generated within the cytoskeleton of the epithelial cells. How the interplay of local differential tensions with tissue geometry and with external forces results in tissue-scale morphogenesis remains an open question. Here, we describe epithelial sheets as active viscoelastic surfaces and study their deformation under patterned internal tensions and bending moments. In addition to isotropic effects, we take into account nematic alignment in the plane of the tissue, which gives rise to shape-dependent, anisotropic active tensions and bending moments. We present phase diagrams of the mechanical equilibrium shapes of pre-patterned closed shells and explore their dynamical deformations. Our results show that a combination of nematic alignment and gradients in internal tensions and bending moments is sufficient to reproduce basic building blocks of epithelial morphogenesis, including fold formation, budding, neck formation, flattening, and tubulation.</description>
