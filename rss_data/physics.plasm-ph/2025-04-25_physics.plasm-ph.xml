      <title>Bremsstrahlung radiation power in non-Maxwellian plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In plasmas, bremsstrahlung includes electron-ion (e-i) bremsstrahlung and electron-electron (e-e) bremsstrahlung. Bremsstrahlung radiation power loss is one of the most significant losses in fusion plasmas, which is more pronounced in higher temperature fusion. The factors that affect bremsstrahlung power include the mean electron energy and the electron velocity distribution shape. In this study, we systematically study the influence of the electron velocity distribution shape on the bremsstrahlung power with fixed total electron energy. It was found that the existing electron velocity distribution shapes have little effect on the bremsstrahlung power. In addition, by analyzing the bounds of bremsstrahlung power, we have provided the theoretical upper and lower bounds of e-i radiation. Our analysis reveals that the e-i bremsstrahlung power depends critically on the degree of energy distribution concentration. Specifically, in non-relativistic regimes, concentrated energy distributions enhance the radiation power, whereas in high-temperature relativistic regimes, such concentration suppresses it. This discrepancy arises from the distinct contributions of high-energy electron populations to radiation power across different energy regimes. For e-e bremsstrahlung, a similar dependence on energy concentration is observed. Furthermore, e-e radiation power exhibits additional sensitivity to the anisotropy of the electron velocity distribution function. These rules could provide a basis for reducing bremsstrahlung power losses in fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of electron-temperature profiles from EUROfusion Pedestal Database using turbulence models and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses plasma-profile data from the EUROfusion pedestal database, focusing on the electron-temperature and electron-density profiles in the edge region of H-mode ELMy JET ITER-Like-Wall (ILW) pulses. We make systematic predictions of the electron-temperature pedestal, using the density profiles and engineering parameters of the pulses as inputs.
  We first present a machine-learning algorithm that, given more inputs than theory-based modelling and 80\% of the database as training data, can reconstruct the remaining 20\% of temperature profiles within 20\% of the experimental values, including accurate estimates of the pedestal width and location. The most important engineering parameters for these predictions are magnetic field strength, particle fuelling rate, plasma current, and strike-point configuration. This confirms the potential of accurate pedestal prediction using large databases.
  Next, we take a simple theoretical approach assuming a local power-law relationship between the gradients of density ($R/L_{n_e}$) and temperature ($R/L_{T_e}$): $R/L_{T_e}=A\left(R/L_{n_e}\right)^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx 0.4$ fits well in the steep-gradient region. When $A$ and $\alpha$ are fit independently for each pedestal, a one-to-one correlation emerges, also valid for JET-C data. For $\alpha = 1$, $A \equiv \eta_e$, a known control parameter for turbulence in slab-ETG theory. Measured values of $\eta_e$ in the steep-gradient region lie well above the slab-ETG stability threshold, suggesting a nonlinear threshold shift or a supercritical turbulent state.
  Finally, we test heat-flux scalings motivated by gyrokinetic simulations, and we provide best-fit parameters for reconstructing JET-ILW pedestals. These models require additional experimental inputs to reach the accuracy of the machine-learning reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Plasma State Monitoring and Disruption Characterization using Multimodal VAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1) continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.</description>

      <title>Collisionless ion-electron energy exchange in magnetized shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy partition between ions and electrons in collisionless shocks has long been an unsolved fundamental physical problem. We show that kinetic simulations of moderate Alfv\'enic Mach number, magnetized, collisionless shocks reveal rapid, faster-than-Coulomb, energy exchange between ions and electrons when the plasma is sufficiently magnetized. Using kinetic and multi-fluid models with counter-streaming ions, we identify resonances between electron whistler and ion magnetohydrodynamic waves that account for this rapid energy exchange.</description>

      <title>A compact laser-plasma source for high-repetition-rate bi-modal X-ray and electron imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bright sources of high-energy X-rays and electrons are indispensable tools in advanced imaging. Yet, current laser-driven systems typically support only single-modality imaging, require complex infrastructure, or operate at low repetition rates. Here, we demonstrate a compact, table-top laser-plasma source capable of generating synchronized electron and X-ray pulses at 1 kHz using just 2 mJ per pulse. A structured methanol droplet target enables quasi-single-shot electron radiographs and broadband, energy-resolved X-ray images, facilitating bi-modal imaging of both metallic and biological specimens. We achieve resolutions of 13.6 um for electrons and 21 um for X-rays, and demonstrate tomographic reconstruction using 35 projections. This compact platform rivals large-scale petawatt systems in resolution and brightness, while remaining scalable and accessible for high-throughput imaging in materials science and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic anomalous diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma. Part One: Nonextensive Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic anomalous dust diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma is investigated using experimental data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility on board the International Space Station. The PK-4 experiment uses video cameras to track individual dust particles, which allows the collection of large amounts of statistical information on the dust particle positions and velocities. These statistics are used to quantify anomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated dust-dust interactions in PK-4. Anisotropies are caused by an externally applied polarity-switched electric field, which modifies the ion wakefields surrounding the dust grains. Video data for nine sets of pressure-current conditions are used to recover Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) plots after subtracting particle drift. Position and velocity histograms are fitted to Tsallis nonextensive probability distribution functions (PDFs). Both MSDs and PDFs indicate a crossover from suprathermal to L\'evy diffusion in the axial direction at higher pressure conditions. In addition, increasing the pressure enhances dust thermal equilibrium, while increasing the current drives the system away from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Transport theory in moderately anisotropic plasmas: I, Collisionless aspects of axisymmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) together with the King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. The characteristic parameter equations (CPEs) are provided based on the general King mixture model (GKMM), serving as the constraint equations of the transport equations. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM). This model is typically a nonlinear system, effective for moderately anisotropic non-equilibrium plasmas.</description>

      <title>Static linear density response from X-ray Thomson scattering measurements: a case study of warm dense beryllium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear response theory is ubiquitous throughout physics and plays a central role in the theoretical description of warm dense matter -- an extreme state that occurs within compact astrophysical objects and that is traversed on the compression path of a fuel capsule in inertial confinement fusion applications. Here we show how one can relate the static linear density response function to X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements, which opens up new possibilities for the diagnostics of extreme states of matter, and for the rigorous assessment and verification of theoretical models and approximations. As a practical example, we consider an XRTS data set of warm dense beryllium taken at the National Ignition Facility [T.~D\"oppner \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature} \textbf{618}, 270-275 (2023)]. The comparison with state-of-the-art \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations [T.~Dornheim \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature Commun.}~(in print), arXiv:2402.19113] gives us a best estimate of the mass density of $\rho=18\pm6\,$g/cc, which is consistent with previous PIMC and density functional theory based studies, but rules out the original estimate of $\rho=34\pm4\,$g/cc based on a Chihara model fit.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate and Extremely High Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+ and 6- - 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential Learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm which learns with focusing the input parameter with the highest variance and can extract the most significant input parameter to the outputs, based on a computed value of "potentiality". It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the OMNI solar wind database, corresponding from solar cycle 23 to beginning of cycle 25, were used as the PL input parameters. PL selected the solar wind velocity as the most significant solar wind parameter for the moderate and extremely high Kp levels. The value of potentiality of solar wind density was, however, could not ignore an impact on geomagnetic activity. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as the PL input data under all Kp levels. At higher than the moderate Kp level, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind velocity, if the plasma density is large, suggesting that not only solar wind velocity but also density might significantly contribute to geomagnetic activity. These PL and statistical investigations show that the solar wind density begins to regulate Kp higher than moderate geomagnetic activity level under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>

      <title>Time delay of mean field interaction in thermal Rydberg atomic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field theory is commonly employed to study nonequilibrium dynamics in hot Rydberg atomic ensembles, but the fundamental mechanism behind the generation of the mean-field interactions remains poorly understood. In this work, we experimentally observe a time-delay effect in the buildup of mean-field interaction, which reveals the key role of collision ionization. We analyze the relevant collision channels and propose a microscopic mechanism that quantitatively explains the hysteresis window observed in optical bistability. Then, using square-wave modulation spectroscopy (SMS) to monitor the growth of the mean-field interaction, we experimentally demonstrate a delay in its dynamical buildup following the initial Rydberg excitation. Finally, we demonstrate how this delay effect may help understand the recently observed self-sustained oscillations in thermal Rydberg gases. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of ionization processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal Rydberg gas, a system of growing interest for quantum sensing and quantum information science.</description>
