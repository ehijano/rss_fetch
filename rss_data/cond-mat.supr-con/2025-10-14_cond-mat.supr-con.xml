      <title>Emergent Network of Josephson Junctions in a Kagome Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with a Kagome lattice are intensely studied because they host novel, exotic states that combine strong correlations and electronic topology. The AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) group, in particular, is of major interest due to its combination of charge density waves, unconventional superconductivity, and indications of time-reversal symmetry breaking and electronic nematicity. Recently, critical current oscillations in an external magnetic field were observed in an unstructured flake of CsV3Sb5 at low current densities. In this work, we unequivocally show that the origin of these oscillations is a network of Josephson junctions intrinsic to the flake that emerges below its critical temperature. Under radio-frequency radiation, we observe perfectly quantized, integer Shapiro steps. The sensitivity of the step height to the contact placement indicates a rich and complex network of junctions. By performing interference studies along multiple field directions, we demonstrate that the observed interference effects are a result of geometrically small junctions and filamentary supercurrent flow. Upon microstructuring the flake, prominent features of the interference pattern are fully preserved, illustrating the localized nature of these flakes and their stability to thermal cycles. These results pave the way for determining the exact nature of superconductivity in the AV3Sb5 family.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional superconducting diode effect in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by the nonreciprocity of Cooper-pair motion with respect to current direction. In three-dimensional (3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction, making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime, where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps, influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor systems.</description>

      <title>Vortex matter and strong pinning in underdoped PrFeAs(O,F) with atomic-sized defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the field-dependent critical current density and pinning force, combined with a detailed analysis of the nanostructural defect landscape in single crystal of underdoped PrFeAs(O,F) superconductor. Our study demonstrates that for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field orientations critical current density exhibits a strong pinning regime in intermediate fields across the entire temperature range. The dominant contribution to pinning originates from oxygen-to-fluorine substitutional defects, oxygen vacancies, which all act as point defects via a quasiparticle mean free path fluctuation mechanism. Scanning transmission electron microscope studies did not reveal any volume or surface defect types within the lattice.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent interference and its transfer in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity represents a macroscopic quantum state notable for its rich manifestations of electronic coherence and collective behavior. Kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A= K, Cs, Rb) possess cascade intertwined quantum phases including superconductivity, symmetry-breaking charge orders, nematic orders and topological states, making them attractive materials for exploring exotic superconducting states. However, the superconducting properties and the Cooper pairing behaviors have not been fully explored and understood. In this work, by studying both the magnetoresistance and critical current behaviors in KV3Sb5 ring and pristine flakes, we reveal the charge 2e paring in KV3Sb5 although anomalous oscillations with smaller periodicity were observed, and report the intrinsic superconducting phase coherence in KV3Sb5 flakes. The former is demonstrated by the careful verification of the Little-Parks oscillations in differential resistance colormaps, and the latter indicates the existence of superconducting domains in KV3Sb5. Moreover, we observed a special phenomenon: the transfer of supercurrent interference patterns between the superconducting ring and the superconducting flake, which demonstrates the global critical current effect of the superconducting phase coherence. These findings provide new insights into the Cooper pairing behaviors in KV3Sb5 and highlight the importance of global effect of superconducting phase coherence in the understanding of the superconducting behaviors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting YH$_9$ Superconductivity and Predicting High-T$_c$ in GdYH$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in $\mathrm{YH_{9}}$ with a critical temperature of approximately $T_c\sim 243 \ K$ has opened a new window toward room temperature superconductivity. In this work, we employ the lowest order constrained variational method to investigate the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the $\mathrm{YH_{9}}$ structure, obtaining results in good agreement with experimental data. % Based on the robustness of the LOCV approach for describing high-$T_c$ superconductors, we further extend our analysis to the gadolinium-yttrium-hydrogen system across various stoichiometries. The key finding of this study is the prediction of a superconducting phase transition at $T_c = 223.2~\mathrm{K}$ for $\mathrm{GdYH_{5}}$ under a critical pressure of approximately $157~\mathrm{GPa}$. This compound crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with space group $P4/mmm$. Moreover, the calculated gap ratio confirms that $\mathrm{GdYH_{5}}$ is a type-II superconductor with a critical current density suitable for potential industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Enhanced Graphene Superconductivity with Record Pauli-Limit Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation of Superconducting and Pseudogap Dynamics in a Bi-based Cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between superconductivity and the pseudogap phase is essential for elucidating the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here we provide direct spatial evidence that these two states are locally and intrinsically correlated. Using spatially and temporally resolved measurements of photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{1.7}$La$_{0.3}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (La-Bi2201), we reveal micrometer-scale spatial contrasts in the transient reflectivity that arise from local variations in the threshold fluence required to disrupt either the superconducting or pseudogap state. The superconducting response remains spatially uniform, whereas the pseudogap exhibits intrinsic inhomogeneity, yet the spatial variations of their threshold fluences closely track each other, establishing a robust local correlation between the two. These results introduce a bulk-sensitive ultrafast optical methodology for visualizing hidden spatial correlations in correlated materials and provide new benchmarks for understanding the intertwined phases in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive evidence for 2x2 pair density wave in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pair-density-wave (PDW) exhibits periodic amplitude and sign modulations of the superconducting order parameter. Such a pairing state has been proposed to be sensitive to nonmagnetic scattering. In this work, we observe the nonmagnetic PDW-breaking effect in a kagome superconductor, using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe 2x2 PDW induced by the coupling between charge order and superconductivity. The global PDW is substantially suppressed upon doping the kagome lattice with dilute isovalent nonmagnetic impurities, whereas the charge order and uniform superconductivity remain robust. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that PDW is distinctly suppressed near dopants. We attribute the PDW suppression to a nonmagnetic PDW breaking effect, arising from phase sign modulation of PDW in the kagome d-orbital hosting Bogoliubov Fermi states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting spin valve effect in Fe/Si$_3$N$_4$/Pb/Si$_3$N$_4$/Fe heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structures of the superconducting spin valve (SSV) Fe/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Pb/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Fe (where Si$_3$N$_4$ is a dielectric insulating layer of controlled thickness) were investigated. The dependence of the magnitude of the SSV effect on the thicknesses of the superconducting (S) and insulating (I) layers was studied. Optimization of the S and I layer thicknesses enabled a complete switching between the normal and superconducting states when the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic (F) layers changed from antiparallel to parallel. A maximal SSV effect value of 0.36\,K was achieved in an external magnetic field of 1\,kOe. These results demonstrate that SSV structures with tunable S/F interface transparency controlled by insulating interlayers are promising for achieving a significant magnitude of the effect. This opens new avenues for the development of such systems and their potential applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnet superconductor hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in superconducting altermagnets and superconductor altermagnet hybrids by computing the alternating spin current and edge the spin density in the presence of an alternating electric field. We show that while in the normal state the effect is not sensitive to the field frequency, in the superconducting state, there is a strong effect for frequencies on the scale of $\Delta_0$ or lower. We contrast the effect to the spin accumulation induced by the spin-Hall effect, by showing that for the altermagnet spin-splitter effect the out-of-phase spin density does not diverge in the adiabatic limit. This difference is attributed to the absence of any equilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnets. In fact, the out-of-phase component vanishes below the gap excitation frequency $2\Delta_0$, because below this frequency the absence of dissipation and the behavior of the system under time-reversal directly determine the relative phase between the charge current, spin current, and spin accumulation. The nonequilibrium effect can be tuned by external parameters like temperature. In fact, it has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, taking its largest value for temperatures around $0.8T_{c}$. The value at this temperature can be significantly larger than the normal state spin density or the low temperature spin density. Thus, besides using the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect to identify altermagnets, its tunability makes it also suitable for applications.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interfaces of quantum Hall insulators with superconductors have emerged as a promising platform to realise interesting physics that may be relevant for topologically protected quantum computing. However, these interfaces can host other effects which obscure the detection of the desired excitations. Here we present measurements of the thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface. We explain the heat transport by considering the formation of a hotspot at the interface, which results in a non-equilibrium distribution of electrons that can propagate across the superconductor through vortex cores. The observed thermoelectric effect results in a voltage which changes sign on quantum Hall plateaus and responds to the rearrangement of vortices in the wire. These observations highlight the complex interplay of thermal and charge phenomena at the quantum Hall -- superconductor interfaces and should be considered when interpreting transport measurements in similar systems.</description>

      <title>Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Loss investigations of high frequency lithium niobate Lamb wave resonators at ultralow temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) operating at ultralow temperatures serve as promising acoustic platforms for implementing microwave-optical transduction and radio frequency (RF) front-ends in aerospace communications because of the exceptional electromechanical coupling (k^2) and frequency scalability. However, the properties of LWRs at cryogenic temperatures have not been well understood yet. Herein, we experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency in higher order antisymmetric LWRs down to millikelvin temperatures. The high-frequency A1 and A3 mode resonators with spurious-free responses are comprehensively designed, fabricated, and characterized. The quality factors of A1 modes gradually increase upon cryogenic cooling and shows 4 times higher than the room temperature value, while A3 mode resonators exhibit a non-monotonic temperature dependence. Our findings provide new insights into loss mechanisms of cryogenic LWRs, paving the way to strong-coupling quantum acoustodynamics and next-generation satellite wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Intermediate chiral edge states in quantum Hall Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in kagome metal YRu3Si2 with strong electron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detailed physical properties of YRu3Si2 with the Ru kagome lattice at normal and superconducting states. The results of resistivity and magnetization show that YRu3Si2 is a type-II bulk superconductor with Tc ~ 3.0 K. The specific heat measurement further suggests that this superconductivity could originate from the weak or moderate electron-phonon coupling. On the other hand, both large Kadawaki-Woods ratio and Wilson ratio indicate that there is a strong electron correlation effect in this system, which may have a connection with the featured flat band of kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>Comment on paper: Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry, Nature 614, 440 (2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c&gt;0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article ("Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c&gt;0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement "the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader.</description>

      <title>Multiple Majorana bound states and their resilience against disorder in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are theoretically predicted to harbor zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in a tunable two-dimensional geometry, at the two ends of the middle metallic channel. Here we show that three distinct topological superconducting regimes, governing the localization of the near-zero-energy MBS, appear in these planar Josephson junctions. The topologically-protected MBS appear near the narrow edges of the junction -- not only in the middle metallic channel but also in the superconducting leads which have widths similar to the values used in recent experiments. We incorporate random fluctuation in the chemical potential to investigate the influence of non-magnetic disorder on the localization of the MBS in different topological regimes and find that the MBS are quite robust against disorder because of the two-dimensional geometry. Interestingly, moderate amount of disorder reduces the splitting between the MBS pairs, possibly by minimizing the wave function overlap of the MBS. We also discuss the changes in the topological superconducting phases when the superconducting lead width is varied. Our results reveal a rich structure of the localization of topologically protected multiple MBS in experimentally-accessible planar Josephson junctions, and call for their experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of strain-controlled split superconducting and time-reversal symmetry-breaking transitions in $s+id$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conditions of the appearance of $U(1)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. Calculations show that if critical temperatures coincide at zero stress, they exhibit a linear kink and no kink otherwise for uniaxial and isotropic strain. Linear kink is absent for shear strain. We find that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that $U(1)$ critical temperature can decrease under compressional [100] uniaxial strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the second part of the paper, we consider the effects of boundaries and finiteness of the sample on the strain-induced splitting of $T_c^{U(1)}$ and $T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling. Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>

      <title>Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene-superconductor hetero-junction: effect of valley polarization and trigonal warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Sn-Intercalated TaSe$_2$: Structural Diversity Obscured by Routine Characterization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate the presence of structural heterogeneity captured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that eludes the routine characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electronic transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtained crystals diverse in stoichiometry and structure, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\lesssim{x}\lesssim1$. Using SCXRD, we found global structural diversity, identifying three new structure types: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{2.0}$/Sn$_{0.08}$TaSe$_{1.96}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.16}$TaSe$_{2.0}$ ($P6_3/mmc$), and Sn$_{1.2}$TaSe$_{1.9}$ ($Fmm2$). Using STEM, we observed local structural diversity, manifested as regions of highly variable stacking within a single crystal. In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction did not resolve all observed global structures. Raman spectroscopy was unable to distinguish between different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Electronic transport measurements showed consistent superconductivity and charge density wave behavior irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount. Our results indicate that routine approaches to characterization of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides may be inadequate for capturing the diversity of this family of materials, highlighting the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.</description>

      <title>Quantized Transport of $\nu = 2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edge with Disordered Superconducting Proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall edge states in proximity to a superconductor (SC) usually acquire a non-quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability in transport, due to non-universal SC couplings and disorders. With counter-propagating modes, we show that the situation can be the opposite in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states with SC proximity, where disordered SC-couplings can reconstruct the edge states into an infinite set of stable phases with quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability along a long edge. Each phase is dominated by a disordered SC-coupling that tunnels $\pm |q_N|$ Cooper pairs, which can take values $|q_N|=1, 4, 15$, etc. We predict that this gives rise to a quantized downstream resistance $R_d = h/(2q^2_Ne^2)$ in an FQH-SC junction, serving as a quantized electrical transport signature beyond the Hall conductance. Higher-order nonlinear transport due to irrelevant Cooper pair tunneling or vortex dissipation is further studied, which becomes dominant when the edge is in a normal phase. Our results apply to both the single-layer state (as a particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/3$) and the bilayer Halperin-(112) state, revealing a rich landscape of disorder-stabilized phases in FQH edge states with SC proximity, and may as well apply to fractional Chern insulators recently observed at the same filling.</description>

      <title>Bogoliubov quasi-particles in superconductors are integer-charged particles inapplicable for braiding quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Vestigial $d$-wave charge-$4e$ Superconductivity from Bidirectional Pair Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the leading vestigial instability due to the melting of a bidirectional pair-density-wave state in two dimensions. In a previous work by one of the authors, it was found that the interplay between pair-density-wave fluctuations with ordering momenta along the $x$ and $y$ directions can provide a strong attractive interaction for charge-$4e$ superconductivity in the $d$-wave channel. In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$ mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due to the suppression of its stiffness.</description>
