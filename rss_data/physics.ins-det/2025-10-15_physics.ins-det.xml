      <title>Towards High-Efficiency Particle Detection Using Superconducting Microwire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of an 8-channel $1\times1$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV hadron beam and 120 GeV muon beam at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron H6 beamline. Following up on our first detailed characterization of the efficiency and response of an SMSPD fabricated on a 3 nm WSi film, we report measurements of enhanced particle detection efficiency using a sensor fabricated from a thicker 4.7nm-thick WSi film. We also report the first SMSPD detection efficiency measurement made for muons. Measurements are enabled by a silicon tracking telescope providing 10 $\mu$m in-situ spatial resolution. The results show a fill factor-normalized detection efficiency of 75% and a time resolution of about 130 ps across pixels. These findings represent a significant advancement toward developing high-efficiency SMSPD charged particle tracking systems with simultaneous precision timing, with potential applications in future accelerator-based experiments such as the FCC-ee and Muon Collider.</description>

      <title>Method to search for the triple-neutron state in an electron scattering experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electron scattering experiment to search for the trineutron state $^3n$ by reaction ${\rm ^4He}(e,~e'p\pi^{+})^{3}n$ is designed for the A1 facility at Mainzer Microtron. The detailed principles, setup, and simulation of this experiment are presented. With the momenta of the scattered electron, the produced proton and $\pi^+$ from the reaction measured by three spectrometers with their triple coincidence, the missing mass spectrum of $^3n$ can be obtained. The production rate of $^3n$ based on the cross section of the reaction and a MC simulation is estimated to be about 1.5 per day, which can provide a confidence level of the signal greater than 5$\sigma$ with a beam time longer than 16 days. According to a MC simulation that evaluates the energy losses of particles in materials and the performance of three spectrometers, the estimated resolution and the predicted shape of the missing mass spectrum are presented. This work provides a new experimental concept for the search for multineutron states in future experiments with an electron beam.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the mass resolving power of FRIB's proposed high-voltage MR-ToF mass separator and spectrometer: addressing non-ideal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separators and spectrometers (MR-ToF MSs) are indispensable tools at radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities. These electrostatic ion beam traps act as highly selective mass separators and high-precision mass spectrometers for rare and exotic nuclei. When well-tuned and designed to minimize higher-order flight-time aberrations, state-of-the-art MR-ToF MSs approach, and slightly exceed, mass resolving powers of \( m / \Delta m = 10^6 \). Achieving \( m / \Delta m &gt; 3 \cdot 10^6 \) would provide the ability to resolve \( &gt;90\% \) of all known isomeric states with half-lives above 10~\text{ms}. However, the ability to mass separate in all practical setups is limited by non-ideal conditions which place such resolving powers out of reach. To this end, we present a simulated analysis of these conditions in the newly proposed high-voltage MR-ToF MS for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). It is expected to store ions at 30~\text{keV} beam energy and increase ion throughput by two orders of magnitude compared to current devices. Existing efforts to mitigate the effects of non-ideal conditions employed for current MR-ToF devices storing ions at \( &lt;3~\text{keV} \) beam energy will already enable mass resolving powers approaching \( 10^6 \) for FRIB's high-voltage MR-ToF device. Simulations of newly proposed mitigation strategies show that even mass resolving powers approaching \( 10^7 \) might become feasible.</description>

      <title>Optimal and efficient inference tools for field tracking with precessing spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise, real-time monitoring of magnetic field evolution is important in applications including magnetic navigation and searches for physics beyond the standard model. One main field-monitoring technique, the spin-precession magnetometer (SPM), observes electron, nucleus, color center, or muon spins as they precess in response to their local magnetic field. Here, we study Bayesian signal-recovery methods for SPMs in the free-induction decay (FID) mode. In particular, we study tracking of field changes well within the coherence time of the spin system, and thus well beyond the response bandwidth, as in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 040503 (2018)]. We derive the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound that dictates the ultimate precision in estimating the Larmor frequency, which we show to be attained by the computationally-expensive prediction error method (PEM). Relative to this benchmark, we show that the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) offer near-optimal tracking that is also computationally efficient, with the use of the latter giving better results only for large spin number. Focusing thus on the EKF, we show that it is sufficient to accurately track fluctuating and unknown transient signals. Our methods can be easily adapted to other types of sensors undergoing non-linear dissipative dynamics and experiencing intrinsic Gaussian-like stochastic noises.</description>

      <title>Bond-resolved STM with density-based methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bond-resolved STM (BRSTM) is a recent technique that combines the advantages of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with the outstanding intramolecular resolution provided by non-contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) using a CO-functionalized tips, offering unique insights into molecular interactions at surfaces. In this work, we present a novel and easily implementable approach for simulating BRSTM images, which we have applied to reproduce new experimental BRSTM data of Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) on Ag(111), obtained with unprecedented control of tip-sample separation ($\sim$10~pm). Our method integrates the Full-Density-Based Model (FDBM) developed for High-Resolution Atomic Force Microscopy (HRAFM) with Chen's derivative approximation for tunneling channels, effectively capturing the contributions of both $\sigma$ and $\pi$ channels, while accounting for the CO-tip deflection induced by probe-sample interactions. This approach accurately reproduces the experimental results for both PTCDA/Ag(111) and 1,5,9-trioxo-13-azatriangulene (TOAT)/Cu(111) systems, including intricate tip-sample distance-dependent features. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the important role of substrate-induced effects, which can modify molecular orbital occupation and the relaxation of the CO probe, resulting in distinct BRSTM image characteristics.</description>

      <title>First experimental proof of PET imaging based on multi-anode MCP-PMTs with Cherenkov radiator-integrated window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) systems to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain or even direct positron emission imaging (dPEI) is of paramount importance for many advanced new clinical applications of PET imaging. This places higher demands on the timing performance of all aspects of PET systems. One effective approach is to use microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs) for prompt Cherenkov photon detection. In this study, we developed a dual-module Cherenkov PET imaging experimental platform, utilising our proprietary 8 * 8-anode Cherenkov radiator-integrated window MCP-PMTs in combination with custom-designed multi-channel electronics, and designed a specific calibration and correction method for the platform. Using this platform, a CTR of 103 ps FWHM was achieved. We overcame the limitations of single-anode detectors in previous experiments, significantly enhanced imaging efficiency and achieved module-level Cherenkov PET imaging for the first time. Imaging experiments involving radioactive sources and phantoms of various shapes and types were conducted, which preliminarily validated the feasibility and advancement of this imaging method. In addition, the effects of normalisation correction and the interaction probability between the gamma rays and the MCP on the images and experimental results were analysed and verified.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence and charge multiplication in liquid xenon with a VCC-like Microstrip Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the first observation of electroluminescence and charge amplification with a Virtual Cathode Chamber (VCC) microstrips plate immersed in liquid xenon. Both were observed in an intense non-uniform electric field in the vicinity of 2-$\mu$m narrow anode strips deposited, with a 2~mm pitch, on a semiconductive glass substrate (S8900), with a cathode film on its backside. An initial light yield of $\sim$460 VUV photons per drifting electron was measured, which degraded within tens of minutes stabilizing at (27.0~$\pm$~3.1)~photons per electron. The electroluminescence was accompanied by electron multiplication with an estimated charge gain $&lt;$10. Further investigations are necessary to understand and mitigate the light yield degradation phenomenon. We expect other substrate materials, including VUV-transparent ones, to provide large stable photon yields, compatible with our model predictions. The VCC configuration has demonstrated great potential in single-phase noble-liquid detectors, particularly for dark-matter searches, neutrino physics and other fields.</description>

Abstract: We present the first physical realization of in-pixel signal processing with integrated AI-based data filtering for particle tracking detectors. Building on prior work that demonstrated a physics-motivated edge-AI algorithm suitable for ASIC implementation, this work marks a significant milestone toward intelligent silicon trackers. Our prototype readout chip performs real-time data reduction at the sensor level while meeting stringent requirements on power, area, and latency. The chip is taped-out in 28nm TSMC CMOS bulk process, which has been shown to have sufficient radiation hardness for particle experiments. This development represents a key step toward enabling fully on-detector edge AI, with broad implications for data throughput and discovery potential in high-rate, high-radiation environments such as the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\pm$90$^{\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\sim$200 MBq to $\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\theta_{1,2}\in[72^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\Delta\phi=90^{\circ}\pm20^{\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\mu$, gaining $\sim$50\% in value during the experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Our design employs two kg-scale gold-platinum test masses which, unlike in the LPF, are surrounded by a shield below 1 K and positioned side-by-side with a centimeter-scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. To estimate the integration time required for GIE detection, we simulate quantum measurements of these modes, considering noise sources such as gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.</description>

      <title>Trapping an Atomic Ion using Time-Division Multiplexed Digital-to-Analog Converters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Independent control of numerous electrodes in quantum charge-coupled device architectures presents a significant challenge for wiring and hardware scalability. To address this issue, we demonstrate a voltage control method based on time-division multiplexing (TDM). This approach utilizes a single high-update-rate digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to sequentially generate control signals for multiple electrodes, thereby reducing both the number of required DACs and associated wiring. We experimentally validate this concept by developing a 10-channel system that operates with only two DACs. The developed TDM-based voltage control system is applied to a surface-electrode trap, where we successfully trap a single $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion and demonstrate a simple ion transport primitive. This approach offers a resource-efficient and scalable solution for advanced quantum computing systems based on trapped ions.</description>
