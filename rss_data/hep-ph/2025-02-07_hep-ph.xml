      <title>Flavor and CP Symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CP properties of effective operators are closely related to the spacetime and internal symmetries, such as the flavor symmetry, in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT). In this work, we utilize the flavor symmetry to organize and reduce numbers of independent Wilson coefficients of the SMEFT operators. We classify the dimension-6 and dimension-8 baryon/lepton-number-conserving operators based on their CP properties. The $U(1)^4$ rephasing symmetry is applied to distinguish CP-odd and CP-violating operators which leads to reduction of the independent CP-violating phases. The $U(3)^5$ and $U(2)^5$ flavor symmetries let us classify the CP-violating phases as the flavor invariants, which can be enumerated by the Hilbert series and obtained explicitly by the Young tensor method. Then after introducing the minimal flavor violation (MFV) hypothesis, we present the flavor structures of the dimension-6 and dimension-8 SMEFT operators under the MFV hypothesis utilizing the spurion method.</description>

      <title>Probing new hadronic forces with heavy exotic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of precision spectroscopy of heavy exotic atoms where electrons are substituted by negative hadrons to detect new force carriers with hadronic couplings. The selected transitions are unaffected by nuclear contact terms, thus enabling highly accurate calculations using bound-state QED, provided that the nuclear polarization is under control. Alternatively, we demonstrate that the dipole polarizability, a fundamental property of nuclei, can be extracted from the spectroscopy of exotic atoms in a novel way by combining two transitions while maintaining high sensitivity to new physics. Based on existing data, we extracted world-leading bounds on mediator masses ranging from $0.1\,$MeV to $10\,$MeV for two benchmark models and show that forthcoming experiments could enhance the sensitivity to new physics by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Complementary Probes of Warped Extra Dimension: Colliders, Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) produced by the supercooled radion phase transition (PT) in warped extra-dimension models solving the gauge hierarchy problem. We first determine how the SGWB and the produced PBH mass and abundance depend on the warped model's infrared energy scale $\rho$, and the number of holographic colors $N$. With this finding, we recast on the plane $\{\rho, N\}$ the current SGWB and PBH constraints, as well as the expected parameter reaches of GW detectors, as LISA and ET, and the gravitational lensing ones, such as NGRST. On the same plane, we also map the collider bounds on massive graviton production, and cosmological bounds on the radion phenomenology. We find that, for $N \sim 10-50$, the considered PT predicts a PBH population mass in the range $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(10^{-1} - 10^{-25}) M_{\odot}$ for $\rho \sim (10^{-4} - 10^{8})\textrm{ TeV}$. In the range $\rho \simeq (0.05 - 0.5)$ GeV, it can explain the recent SGWB hint at nHz frequencies and generate PBH binaries with mass $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(0.1 - 1 ) M_\odot$ detectable at LISA and ET. The experimentally allowed mass region where PBHs can account for the whole dark matter abundance, and are produced with a tuning $\lesssim 10^{-4}$, corresponds to $10$ TeV $\lesssim \rho\lesssim$ $10^4$ TeV. These PBHs can compensate the lack of natural candidates for dark matter in warped extra dimensional models. Such a region represents a great science case where forthcoming and future colliders like HE-LHC and FCC-hh, gravitational-wave observatories and other PBHs probes play a key complementary role.</description>

      <title>Higgs Thermal Nonequilibrium in Primordial QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the chemical and kinetic nonequilibrium dynamics of the Higgs boson during the primordial Universe QGP (quark-gluon plasma) epoch $130\mathrm{\,GeV}&gt;T&gt;10\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that the Higgs bosons is always out of chemical abundance equilibrium with a fugacity $\Upsilon_h = 0.69$ due to virtual decay channels. Additionally, Higgs momentum distribution is found to be ``cold'' for $T&lt;40$\,GeV, since the scattering rate drops below the production rate.</description>

      <title>Investigating the 95 GeV Higgs Boson Excesses within the I(1+2)HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I, extended by an inert doublet, can provide an explanation for the recently observed excesses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau^+ \tau^- $ final states. Hence, by imposing theoretical constraints and experimental bounds on the model parameter space, our findings show that a light CP-even Higgs boson, $h$, with a mass around 95 GeV, can account for these anomalies. This result aligns with the excess in $b\bar b$ signatures reported in earlier data from the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to Triple Higgs Couplings via Di-Higgs Production in the RxSM at the (HL-)LHC and future $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM) without $Z_2$ symmetry, the RxSM, is the simplest extension of the SM that features a First Order Electroweak Phase Transition (FOEWPT) in the early universe. The FOEWPT is one of the requirements needed for electroweak baryogenesis to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). Thus, the RxSM is a perfect example to study features related to the FOEWPT at current and future collider experiments. The RxSM has two CP-even Higgs bosons, $h$ and $H$, with masses $m_h &lt; m_H$, where we assume that $h$ corresponds to the Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. Our analysis is based on a benchmark plane that ensures the occurence of a strong FOEWPT, where $m_H &gt; 2 m_h$ is found. In a first step we analyze the di-Higgs production at the (HL-)LHC, $gg \to hh$, with a focus on the impact of the trilinear Higgs couplings (THCs), $\lambda_{hhh}$ and $\lambda_{hhH}$. The interferences of the resonant $H$-exchange diagram involving $\lambda_{hhH}$ and the non-resonant diagrams result in a characteristic peak-dip (or dip-peak) structure in the $m_{hh}$ distribution. We analyze how $\lambda_{hhH}$ can be accessed, taking into account the experimental smearing and binning. We also demonstrate that the approximation used by ATLAS and CMS for the resonant di-Higgs searches may fail to capture the relevant effects and lead to erroneous results. In a second step we analyze the benchmark plane at a future high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider with $\sqrt{s} = 1000$ GeV (ILC1000). We demonstrate the potential sensitivity to $\lambda_{hhH}$ via an experimental determination at the ILC1000.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group invariant mean-field model for QCD at finite isospin density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potentials has phenomenological relevance for a series of physical systems and provides an ideal testground for the modeling of dense strongly interacting matter. The two-flavor quark-meson model is known to effectively describe the condensation of charged pions in QCD that occurs in this setting. In this paper, we work out a renormalization-group invariant mean-field formulation of the model and demonstrate that the resulting phase diagram and equation of state is in quantitative agreement with data from lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>New axion contribution to the two-photon decays of neutral pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of axions introduces new diagrams at one-loop order to the two-photon decays of the neutral pion through axion-pion mixing. In this work, we calculate this correction, missing in all current calculations, in the framework of SU(2) chiral perturbation theory. We show that the correction is proportional to the axion-photon coupling and the square of axion mass, which in turn is strongly suppressed by the axion decay constant for the classical space window but may not be negligible for the QCD axion in the MeV or even larger mass range. On the other hand, in combination with the experimental measurement of the decay width of $\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ process, this result rules out the standard QCD axion as an explanation for the possible discrepancy between the chiral perturbation theory prediction and the experimental data.</description>

      <title>The Cabibbo-favored hadronic weak decays of the $\Xi_c$ in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-favored hadronic weak decay of the $\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0\pi^+$, $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^-\pi^+$, $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^0\pi^0$, $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^0\eta^{(')}$ and $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^+K^-$ are studied in the non-relativistic constituent quark model. By analyzing their decay mechanisms at the quark level we show that the pole terms are essential for understanding the transition dynamics in addition to the usually considered direct meson emission process and color suppressed process in the charmed baryon hadronic weak decays. The experimentally measurable asymmetry parameters are also predicted in order to further pin down the decay mechanism.</description>

      <title>Can a secluded self-interacting dark sector generate detectable gravitational waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the possibility to detect the gravitational waves generated by a secluded self-interacting dark sector. ``Secluded'' means that the dark sector has almost no portal to the visible sector and thus its entropy is conserved by itself, and ``self-interacting'' means that dark matter in this model has a significant interaction to itself, making it consistent with the small-scale structure observations. A spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ is introduced for the interactions in the dark sector, and nearly massless dark radiation is also introduced to avoid the over-closure problem. Through a parameter space scan, we find that this model is highly constrained by the current observed effective number of neutrinos ($N_{\text{eff}}$) and the large-scale structure observable Lyman-$\alpha$. Combined together, these two constraints make such a secluded self-interacting dark sector almost impossible to generate gravitational waves accessible at future projects like SKA or LISA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first extraction of transverse-momentum-dependent distributions of unpolarised quarks from experimental Drell-Yan data using neural networks to parametrise their nonperturbative part. We show that neural networks outperform traditional parametrisations providing a more accurate description of data. This work establishes the feasibility of using neural networks to explore the multi-dimensional partonic structure of hadrons and paves the way for more accurate determinations based on machine-learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of $B_s \to SP$ Decays in Perturbative QCD Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the perturbative QCD (PQCD) framework, we present a systematic investigation of charmless $B_s \to SP$ decays, where $S$ and $P$ denote scalar and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively. By employing two distinct structural scenarios for scalar mesons, we calculate the branching fractions and direct $CP$ asymmetries for these processes. Our results reveal branching fractions ranging from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-5}$, values that are well within the measurable range of current experiments. A striking contrast emerges between penguin- and tree-dominated decays: while penguin-dominated processes yield larger branching fractions, tree-dominated decays exhibit significantly enhanced direct $CP$ asymmetries. In particular, the decays $B_s \to f_0(1370) \eta$ and $B_s \to a_0(1450) K$ demonstrate marked sensitivity to the choice of scalar meson scenario, offering critical constraints for identifying the optimal model once experimental data are available. Furthermore, we calculate the branching fractions of $B_s \to f_0(980)(\sigma)P$ decays in two distinct ranges of the mixing angle of $f_0(980)-\sigma$. The dependencies of both branching fractions and $CP$ asymmetries on this mixing angle are rigorously analyzed, establishing a framework essential for determining its value with future experimental results. These findings provide a robust theoretical foundation for advancing the understanding of nonleptonic $B_s$decays in QCD-based formalisms, as well as the nature of scalar mesons.</description>

      <title>Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin Transformations in Quantum Electrodynamics: For Perturbation Theory and Dynamical Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive analysis of the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations for a charged fermion propagator at the two-loop level in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Starting with an arbitrary covariant gauge $\xi$ and space-time dimension $d$, we provide its explicit expressions in three and four-dimensional QED. We begin with the tree-level fermion propagator in the Landau gauge and gauge-transform it to obtain an analytical expression for an all order result in an arbitrary covariant gauge. We expand it out to two-loops both for the massless and massive propagators in three and four space-time dimensions. In addition to comparing with all earlier results in the literature wherever possible, we also study constraints of multiplicative renormalizabilty of our results in four-dimensional QED which are logarithmically divergent. Finally, we analyze representative solutions of the fermion propagator which correspond to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation in QED. We study the gauge dependence of these emergent solutions, that of the Euclidean pole mass and the chiral fermion condensate.</description>

      <title>Fermion Dark Matter Effect on Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of extra scalars to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics enriches the vacuum structure and consequently gives rise to strong first-order phase transitions (EWPT) in the early universe. We raise the question that how the EWPT is affected by the addition of fermions in models beyond the SM, and address this question by studying the EWPT in a dark matter model comprising a singlet scalar and two Dirac fermions. The singlet scalar develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV), and the lighter fermion plays the role of the dark matter. The model evades the stringent direct detection bounds due to the presence of two fermions. We first show that applying the high-temperature approximation, no first-order phase transition is found. Then we demonstrate that when including the full finite temperature corrections to the effective potential, the first-order phase transition becomes possible, nevertheless, all the phase transitions will be weak. We therefore deduce that the addition of fermions reduces the strength of the EWPT.</description>

      <title>Closing in on Pop-III Stars: Constraints and Predictions Across the Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of direct high redshift observations poses a significant challenge in understanding the properties of first stars. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of entire stellar populations can be studied with current data. In this work we use a combination of high redshift observables in order to infer the formation and emission properties of the first stellar populations: high redshift UVLFs, the optical depth of CMB photons to reionization, hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra, and measurements of the soft cosmic X-ray background. We study two minimal models of stellar population: i) a single, Pop-II, stellar population which dominates throughout Cosmic Dawn, ii) two distinct stellar populations, Pop-II and Pop-III, dominating at different times with the transition between them taken as a free parameter. We set strong constraints on the properties of Pop-II stars, and upper limits on the formation and multi-wavelength emission of Pop-III stars. After applying the constraints above, we present the viable envelopes of the 21-cm global signal with and without Pop-III stars. We identify a region in the parameter space of the two population model which predicts a global 21-cm signal distinctive from that of the single population one. A measurement of such a signal would be a strong indication for the presence of Pop-III stars at early times.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

      <title>Complementary signatures of $\alpha-$attractor inflation in CMB and cosmic string Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Spectral parameters of the $\rho$ resonance from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of the $\rho$ resonance using nine $N_f = 2 + 1$ Wilson-Clover ensembles with three lattice spacings and various pion masses ranging from $135$ to $320$ MeV. For each ensemble, a large number of finite volume energy levels are determined and the energy dependence of the phase shift obtained from L\"uscher's finite volume method. The mass and width of the $\rho$ resonance are then extracted by assuming the Breit-Wigner form. The mass and width are extrapolated to the physical pion mass and continuum limit ($\mathcal{O}(a^2)$) using a linear function of $a^2$ and $m^2_\pi$. The extrapolated values for the mass and width in the Breit-Wigner form are $(m_\rho,\,\Gamma_\rho) = (781.6\pm10.0,\, 146.5\pm 9.9)$ MeV, which are in good agreement with experiment. An alternative method of analysis, based on Hamiltonian effective field theory, involves directly fitting the lattice energy levels and accounting for the quark mass dependence of the hadronic loop diagrams which yield the leading and next-to-leading non-analytic behaviour. This approach also yields consistent $\rho$ parameters at the physical point. This represents the most precise determination to date of the mass and width of a hadron which is unstable under strong decay, achieved through comprehensive lattice QCD calculations and methods of analysis.</description>

      <title>HEP-JEPA: A foundation model for collider physics using joint embedding predictive architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a transformer architecture-based foundation model for tasks at high-energy particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider. We train the model to classify jets using a self-supervised strategy inspired by the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture. We use the JetClass dataset containing 100M jets of various known particles to pre-train the model with a data-centric approach -- the model uses a fraction of the jet constituents as the context to predict the embeddings of the unseen target constituents. Our pre-trained model fares well with other datasets for standard classification benchmark tasks. We test our model on two additional downstream tasks: top tagging and differentiating light-quark jets from gluon jets. We also evaluate our model with task-specific metrics and baselines and compare it with state-of-the-art models in high-energy physics. Project site: https://hep-jepa.github.io/</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive Boson Stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields. The equation of state of massive boson stars and their masses, radii, modeled by a self-interacting scalar field with potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2|\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda |\phi|^4$ are known to follow scaling relations. The non-radial fundamental oscillations of such massive BSs have been studied only for a few select model parameters so far. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the $f$-mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit ($\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2$). This opens up the outstanding prospect of studying the $f$-modes of massive BSs throughout the scalar DM parameter space. We study the implications of this finding by carrying out a detailed study of massive BS $f$-modes in a separate work. Here, having introduced this scaling, we use it to compare boson star oscillations with the neutron star and black hole quasinormal modes, thus providing a smoking gun for the distinguishability of BSs using gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars -- II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boson Stars (BSs) are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects (ECO) would manifest as dark Boson stars and can contribute to a certain fraction of the dark matter (DM) in the universe. In this work, we study the fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) of massive BSs and the associated gravitational wave (GW) emission. We consider massive scalar BSs having the potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2|\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda |\phi|^4$, restricting to the strong-coupling regime ($\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2$) where solutions resembling fermionic stars are known to exist. We first review the available parameter space for scalar DM that can form massive BSs and enlist various constraints. We fit and provide simple analytical relations connecting various macroscopic observables for BSs, which can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive BSs throughout the strong coupling regime without requiring any numerical computation. We then solve for the non-radial $l=2$ fundamental quasinormal modes ($f$-modes) for massive BSs. Scaling relations for $f$-mode equations have been reported in another work. Using these, we perform a complete study of these oscillations spanning the entire available parameter space of massive BSs and provide analytical fits for the $f$-mode characteristics. We further study the universal relations for BSs and reveal the parameter space that is sensitive to the current and future planned GW detectors. We find that different parts of the parameters space can, in principle, be probed by the LISA, LIGO, and NEMO detectors. Finally, we briefly discuss the detectability of $f$-modes from BSs that have not been explored before.</description>

Abstract: QCD admits a contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which potentially gives rise to nontrivial phases and violates CP. This is essentially a question of how the vacuum reacts to the $\theta$ term. In this talk I will address the problem using new developments on the lattice. The overall solution is contrasted with the axion `solution'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of the nucleation rate $\Gamma$ for first order phase transitions are important for determining their observable consequences in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used, but they are incomplete and should be tested against fully nonperturbative lattice simulations. We simulate nucleation on the lattice in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, a scenario which should be well described by perturbation theory. Our computation of the nucleation rate, however, only shows qualitative agreement with the perturbative result. This motivates further study of nucleation on the lattice and to higher orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>$D_1$ and $D_2$ resonances in coupled-channel scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isospin-1/2 charmed axial-vector $D^*\pi-D^*\eta-D^*_s\bar{K}$ scattering amplitudes are computed, along with interactions in several other $I=1/2$ $J^P$ channels. Using lattice QCD, we work at a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV, where the lowest three-hadron threshold ($D\pi\pi$) lies high enough to enable a rigorous treatment of this system considering only two-hadron scattering channels. At this light-quark mass, an axial-vector $D_1$ bound state is observed just below $D^*\pi$ threshold, that is strongly coupled to $D^*\pi$ in a relative $S$-wave and influences a wide energy region up to the $D^*\eta$ threshold. An axial-vector $D_1^\prime$ resonance is observed in the elastic $D^*\pi$ energy-region, which is coupled more strongly to $D$-wave $D^*\pi$. A single narrow tensor state is seen in $J^P=2^+$ coupled to both $D\pi$ and $D^*\pi$. In the region where $D^*\eta$ and $D^*_s\bar{K}$ are kinematically open, the available energy levels indicate significant $S$-wave interactions. Upon searching this region for poles, several possibilities exist with large uncertainties. One additional state consistently arises, predominantly coupled to the $S$-wave $D^*\pi-D^*\eta-D^*_s\bar{K}$ amplitudes around the upper energy limit of this analysis.</description>

Abstract: The NA62 experiment at CERN has the capability to collect data in a beam-dump mode, where 400 GeV protons are dumped on an absorber. In this configuration, New Physics particles, including dark photons, dark scalars, and axion-like particles, may be produced in the absorber and decay in the instrumented volume beginning approximately 80 m downstream of the dump. A search for these particles decaying in flight to hadronic final states is reported, based on an analysis of a sample of $1.4 \times 10^{17}$ protons on dump collected in 2021. No evidence of a New Physics signal is observed, excluding new regions of parameter spaces of multiple models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parametric representation has been used since a long time for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. As a dimension independent intermediate representation, it allows a clear description of singularities. Recently, it has become a choice tool for the investigation of the type of transcendent numbersappearing in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. The inclusion of numerators has however stagnated since the ground work of Nakanishi. I here show howto greatly simplify the formulas through the use of Dodgson identities. In the massless case in particular, reduction to the completion to a vacuum graph allows for a strong reduction of the maximal power of the Symanzik polynomial in the denominator.</description>

Abstract: White dwarfs and neutron stars are far-reaching and multi-faceted laboratories in the hunt for dark matter. We review detection prospects of wave-like, particulate, macroscopic and black hole dark matter that make use of several exceptional properties of compact stars, such as ultra-high densities, deep fermion degeneracies, low temperatures, nucleon superfluidity, strong magnetic fields, high rotational regularity, and significant gravitational wave emissivity. Foundational topics first made explicit in this document include the effect of the ``propellor phase" on neutron star baryonic accretion, and the contribution of Auger and Cooper pair breaking effects to neutron star heating by dark matter capture.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration has measured the processes $B^0\to\bar{D}^0D_s^+\pi^-$ and $B^+\to\bar{D}^0D_s^+\pi^+$, where the $D_s^+\pi^-$ and $D_s^+\pi^+$ invariant mass distributions show the significant signals of two new open-flavor tetraquark states $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^{++}$, as the two of the isospin triplet. In this work, we have investigated the process $\Lambda_b\to K^0D^0\Lambda$ by taking into account the intermediate nucleon resonance $N^*(1535)$ and the tetraquark state $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^0$, which could be dynamically generated by the interactions of the $D^*K^*/D^*_s\rho$ and the pseoduscalar mesons-octet baryons, respectively. Our results show that a clear peak of the open-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$ may appear in the $K^0D^0$ invariant mass distribution of the process $\Lambda_b\to K^0D^0\Lambda$, which could be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting series expansions of neutrino oscillation and decay probabilities in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytic expressions for three-flavor neutrino oscillations in presence of invisible neutrino decay and matter effects. Using the well-known Cayley-Hamilton formalism, the leading-order terms are derived for oscillation probabilities in all major channels assuming the neutrino mass eigenstate $\nu_3$ to decay. Our work extends and complements previous studies utilizing the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, providing the series expansions for $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_e$, $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\mu$, $\nu_e \rightarrow \nu_\tau$, $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau$. The accuracy of the analytical formulas is investigated by comparing the results with numerically calculated probabilities. We also comment on the implications on unitarity violation.</description>

      <title>Final state radiation from high and ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged leptons produced by high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos have a substantial probability of emitting prompt internal bremsstrahlung $\nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell + X + \gamma$. This can have important consequences for neutrino detection. We discuss observable consequences at high- and ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes and the Large Hadron Collider's Forward Physics Facility. Logarithmic enhancements can be substantial (e.g., $\sim 20\%$) when either the charged lepton's energy or the rest of the cascade is measured. We comment on final state radiation's impacts on measuring the inelasticity distribution, $\nu/\bar{\nu}$ flux ratio, throughgoing muons, and double-bang signatures for high-energy neutrino observation. Furthermore, for ultrahigh-energy neutrino observation, we find that final state radiation increases the overall detectable energy by as much as 20\%, affects flavor measurements, and decreases the energy of both Earth-emergent tau leptons and regenerated tau neutrinos. Many of these have significant impacts on measuring neutrino fluxes and spectra. Finally, for the Large Hadron Collider's Forward Physics Facility, we find that final state radiation will impact future extractions of strange quark parton distribution functions. Final state radiation should be included in future analyses at neutrino telescopes and the Forward Physics Facility.</description>

Abstract: We show that, in the Nelson-Barr solution to the strong CP-problem, a naturally light scalar can arise. It gives rise to a completely new phenomenology beyond that of the celebrated QCD axion, if this field constitutes dark matter, as the CKM elements vary periodically in time. We also discuss how the model can be tested using quantum sensors, in particular using nuclear clocks, which leads to an interesting synergy between different frontiers of physics.</description>

      <title>Blade: A package for block-triangular form improved Feynman integrals decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present the package {\tt Blade} as the first implementation of the block-triangular form improved Feynman integral reduction method. The block-triangular form has orders of magnitude fewer equations compared to the plain integration-by-parts system, allowing for strictly block-by-block solutions. This results in faster evaluations and reduced resource consumption. We elucidate the algorithms involved in obtaining the block-triangular form along with their implementations. Additionally, we introduce novel algorithms for finding the canonical form and symmetry relations of Feynman integrals, as well as for performing spanning-sector reduction. Our benchmarks for various state-of-the-art problems demonstrate that {\tt Blade} is remarkably competitive among existing reduction tools. Furthermore, the {\tt Blade} package offers several distinctive features, including support for complex kinematic variables or masses, user-defined Feynman prescriptions for each propagator, and general integrands.</description>

      <title>A phenomenological estimate of rescattering effects in $B_s\to K^{*0}\bar{K}^{*0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurements in $b\to s$ penguin-dominated decays are widely recognized as a powerful test for searching for New Physics by studying the deviation from theoretical estimations within the Standard Model. We examine the final-state rescattering effects on the decay $B_s\to K^{*0}\bar{K}^{*0}$ and provide estimations of the branching ratio and longitudinal polarization of $B_s\to K^{*0}\bar{K}^{*0}$, which is consistent with experimental observations. Our conclusion is that both short- and long-distance interactions contribute significantly in this decay. The small longitudinal polarization in $B\to VV$ modes may not be a signal for New Physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman integrals can be expanded asymptotically with respect to some small parameters at the integrand level, a technique known as the expansion by regions. A naive expansion by regions may break down due to divergences not regulated by the spacetime dimension, exemplified by the rapidity divergences. A criterion to identify unregulated divergences is provided in this article. The analysis is conducted using both parametric and Mellin-Barnes representations, leading to a consistent conclusion. Based on this analysis, it is proven that the presence of unregulated divergences implies the degeneracies of regions.</description>

      <title>A Modern Look at the Oscillation Physics Case for a Neutrino Factory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments, JUNO, DUNE, and HK, are under construction now and will collect data over the next decade and beyond. As there are no approved plans to follow up this program with more advanced neutrino oscillation experiments, we consider here one option that had gained considerable interest more than a decade ago: a neutrino factory. Such an experiment uses stored muons in a racetrack configuration with extremely well characterized decays reducing systematic uncertainties and providing for more oscillation channels. Such a machine could also be one step towards a high energy muon collider program. We consider a long-baseline configuration to SURF using the DUNE far detectors or modifications thereof, and compare the expected sensitivities of the three-flavor oscillation parameters to the anticipated results from DUNE and HK. We show optimal beam configurations, the impact of charge identification, the role of statistics and systematics, and the expected precision to the relevant standard oscillation parameters in different DUNE vs.~neutrino factory configurations.</description>

      <title>The $q_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$ spectra in top-antitop hadroproduction at NNLL+NNLO: the interplay of soft-collinear resummation and Coulomb singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the resummation-improved differential transverse momentum and azimuthal decorrelation cross sections, $d\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/dq_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $d\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/d\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$, in top-antitop pair production at the LHC. Our calculation is based on the observation that both cross sections are dominated by topologies where the top-quark pair is well separated, expressed in their relative velocity $\beta_{t\bar{t}}\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, at colliding energies of $\sqrt{s}=13\,\text{TeV}$ or higher. Therefore, the asymptotic behaviour in the limits $q_{\mathrm{T}}\to0$ and $\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}\to0$ can mostly be captured by the soft and collinear resummation in the HQET$+$SCET framework. Nevertheless, starting at NNLL, Coulomb singularities emerge in the threshold regime, $\beta_{t\bar{t}}\to0$, in both the hard sector and its evolution kernels, leading to unphysical results upon integration over the entire $\beta_{t\bar{t}}$ range. To this end, two prescriptions, dubbed the D- and R-prescription, are introduced to regularise these Coulomb singularities. They embody two fundamentally different methods to truncate the threshold enhanced terms, rendering their contribution finite. In the absence of a combined threshold and small-transverse-momentum resummation, we present a quantitative assessment of the ambiguity introduced by the choice of prescription, itself a test of the sensitivity of our calculation to such threshold enhancements, for both the $d\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/dq_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $d\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/d\Delta\phi_{t\bar{t}}$ spectra.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the open-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$ in the process $\bar{B}_s^0 \to K^0 D^0 \pi^0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration has measured two decay processes $B^0\to\bar{D}^0D_s^+\pi^-$ and $B^+\to D^-D_s^+\pi^+$ related to isospin symmetry, where two new open-flavor tetraquark states $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^{++}$ that belong to an isospin triplet were observed in the $D_s^+\pi^-$ and $D_s^+\pi^+$ invariant mass distributions. In this work, we have investigated the validity of the process $\bar{B}_s^0\to K^0D^0\pi^0$ as the promising process to confirm the existence of $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^0$ resonance. Taking into account the tetraquark state $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, as well as intermediate resonances $K^*(892)$, $K_0^*(1430)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$, it has been shown that a clear peak of the open-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$ appears in the $K^0D^0$ invariant mass distribution of the process $\bar{B}_s^0\to K^0D^0\pi^0$, which could be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the near-threshold enhancement and the dip structure around 1~GeV in the $\pi^0\pi^0$ invariant mass distribution of the process $D^0\to \pi^0\pi^0\bar{K}^0$ observed by the CLEO Collaboration, we have investigated this process by taking into account the contribution from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interactions within the chiral unitary approach, and also the one from the intermediate resonance $K^{*}(892)$. Our results are in good agreement with the CLEO measurements, which implies that, the near-threshold enhancement near the $\pi^0\pi^0$ threshold is mainly due to the contributions from the scalar meson $f_0(500)$ and the intermediate $K^*$, and the cusp structure around 1~GeV in the $\pi^0\pi^0$ invariant mass distribution should be associated with the scalar meson $f_0(980)$.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of energy correlation functions and jet angularities for heavy-flavour QCD jets. In particular, we discuss the possibility of using these observables to expose the dead cone effect, i.e. the suppression of collinear QCD radiation around massive quarks, and to investigate the sensitivity of different observable definitions to the presence of quark masses. Our calculations are presented as all-order resummed predictions at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy, matched to (partial) fixed-order results to obtain a better description of the transition around the dead cone threshold. We also compare our analytic results with Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa Monte Carlo predictions to estimate the impact of non-perturbative contributions such as hadronisation, underlying events and $B$-hadron decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laser of an intense electromagnetic field provides an important tool to study the strong-field particle physics. The nonlinear Compton scattering was observed in the collision of an ultra-relativistic electron beam with a laser pulse in 1990s. The precision measurement of the nonlinear Compton scattering shines the light on the studies of strong-field QED and nonlinear effects in QED. In this work, we propose to produce new massive particles through the nonlinear Compton scattering in the presence of a high intense laser field. We take dark photon or axion-like particle as illustrative new particle. Compared with other collider and beam dump experiments, the laser induced process provides a complementary and competitive search of new invisible particles lighter than 1 MeV.</description>

      <title>NLO QCD predictions for $\boldsymbol{t\bar{t}\gamma}$ with realistic photon isolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete description of top quark pair production in association with a hard photon in the di-lepton decay channel. The calculation is performed at NLO QCD and includes all resonant and non-resonant Feynman diagrams, interferences, and finite-width effects of the top quarks and $W^\pm/Z$ gauge bosons. We provide the results for the $pp\to e^+\nu_e \,\mu^- \bar{\nu}\, b\bar{b}\,\gamma+X$ process using the fixed-cone, smooth-cone and hybrid-photon isolation criteria. The fixed-cone isolation criterion allows contributions from collinear photon radiation off QCD partons, which requires the inclusion of parton-to-photon fragmention processes. To this end, we include the latter contributions into our computational framework. We quantify the impact of different photon-isolation prescriptions on the integrated and differential cross-section predictions for the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. Our state-of-the-art NLO QCD results with the fixed-cone criterion allow us to reproduce the photon-isolation prescription employed in ATLAS and CMS. This will help to improve future comparisons with the LHC data.</description>

Abstract: We study the decay processes of $B\rightarrow \rho\eta$, $\rho\eta^{\prime}$ in the perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) approach with a few improvements incorporated in it, where the contributions with large momentum transfer are calculated perturbatively, and the contributions with lower energy scale are treated by introducing soft transition form factors. In addition, color-octet contributions are introduced which are essentially long-distance contributions. With reasonable input parameters selected, we find that the theoretical results of the branching ratios and $CP$ violations are all consistent with experimental data. We also predict some unmeasured quantities, which can be tested by experiment in the future.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the hadronic light-by-light tensor in corner kinematics for the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersive approach to the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$ involves an integral over three virtual photon momenta appearing in the light-by-light tensor. Building upon previous works, we systematically derive short-distance constraints in the region where two momenta are large compared to the third, the so-called Melnikov-Vainshtein or corner region. We include gluonic corrections for the different scalar functions appearing in the Lorentz decomposition of the underlying tensor, and explicitly check analytic agreement with alternative operator product expansions in overlapping regimes of validity. A very strong pattern of cancellations is observed for the final $g-2$ integrand. The last observation suggests that a very compact expression only containing the axial current form factors can provide a good approximation of the corner region of the hadronic light-by-light tensor.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of isospin asymmetric QCD with small baryon chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our measurement of the equation of state of isospin asymmetric QCD to small baryon and strangeness chemical potentials, using the leading order Taylor expansion coefficients computed directly at non-zero isospin chemical potentials. Extrapolating the fully connected contributions to vanishing pion sources is particularly challenging, which we overcome by using information from isospin chemical potential derivatives evaluated numerically. Using the Taylor coefficients, we present, amongst others, first results for the equation of state along the electric charge chemical potential axis, which is potentially of relevance for the evolution of the early Universe at large lepton flavour asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Solar Model Independent Constraints on the Sterile Neutrino Interpretation of the Gallium Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of most up-to-date solar neutrino data and KamLAND reactor antineutrino data in the framework of the 3+1 sterile neutrino mixing scenario (invoked to explain the results of the Gallium source experiments) with the aim of quantifying the dependence of the (in)compatibility of the required mixing with assumptions on the initial fluxes. The analysis of solar data is performed in two alternative ways: using the flux predicted by the latest standard solar models, and in a model independent approach where the solar fluxes are also determined by the fit. The dependence on the normalization of the capture rate in the solar Gallium experiments is also quantified. Similarly, in the KamLAND analysis we consider both the case where the reactor flux normalization is assumed to be known a priori, as well as a normalization free case which relies solely on available neutrino data. Using a parameter goodness of fit test, we find that in most cases the compatibility between Gallium and solar+KamLAND data only occur at the $3\sigma$ level or higher. We also discuss the implications of enforcing better compatibility by tweaking the mechanism for the energy production in the Sun.</description>

      <title>Tuning towards the edge of a dark abyss: Implications of a tuning paradigm on the hierarchy between the weak and dark matter scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that tuning towards the boundary of the positivity domain of the scalar potential may explain the separation between the electroweak scale and the unification scale in a grand unified theory. Here we explore the possibility that the same type of tuning might account for the generation of the electroweak scale from a much lighter dynamically generated scale in a dark sector. We present a model that realizes this idea and provides a proof of principle that the same dark sector can include a viable dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>A common origin of the Higgs boson and the flavor hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model that extends the electroweak gauge symmetry of the Standard Model in a non-universal way to $SU(2)_{L}^{\prime}\times U(1)_X \times SU(2)_{L}^{q_3}\times SU(2)_R^{\ell_3}$. This symmetry is spontaneously broken to $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ near the TeV scale by a condensate of a new composite sector. Charging appropriately the fermionic degrees of freedom of the composite sector, anomaly cancellation enforces the Standard Model fermions to be charged in such a way that the extended gauge interactions respect a $U(2)_q\times U(2)_e\times U(3)_u\times U(3)_d\times U(3)_\ell$ accidental flavor symmetry. In addition, from the same symmetry breaking, a composite Higgs boson emerges as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the strong dynamics of the new sector. Due to the extended gauge and the specific flavor symmetry, leading Yukawa couplings between Higgs and fermions can only be written for the third generation and higher dimension operators generate suppressed light-family Yukawa couplings. Furthermore, CKM mixing angles between third and light families result naturally suppressed while the PMNS ones, anarchic. The model thus provides a unified origin for the Higgs boson and the flavor hierarchies between third and light families.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Form Factors from GPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel ansatz for Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), named GSAMA24. This ansatz aims to provide a more accurate and comprehensive description of the internal structure of hadrons by incorporating advanced parameterizations and fitting techniques. We compare the performance of the GSAMA24 ansatz with three established models: the Extended Regge (ER), Modified Gaussian (MG), and M-HS22 ansatz. The GSAMA24 ansatz is designed to address limitations observed in previous models by offering improved flexibility in the ( $t$ )-dependence and skewness parameter $\xi$. Our analysis involves fitting the GSAMA24 ansatz to experimental form factor data and evaluating its predictive power against the ER, MG, and M-HS22 models. The comparison is based on key metrics such as the accuracy of form factor predictions, the consistency with known GPD properties, and the computational efficiency of the fitting process. Results indicate that the GSAMA24 ansatz provides a superior fit to the experimental data, particularly in the high momentum transfer region, where it outperforms the ER and MG models. Additionally, the GSAMA24 ansatz demonstrates better agreement with the theoretical expectations of GPD behavior compared to the M-HS22 model. These findings suggest that the GSAMA24 ansatz is a promising tool for future studies of hadronic structure and could significantly enhance our understanding of the spatial and momentum distributions of quarks and gluons within hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel technique for sampling particle physics model parameter space. The main sampling method applied is Nested Sampling (NS), which is boosted by the application of multiple Machine Learning (ML) networks, e.g., Self-Normalizing Network (SNN) and Normalizing Flow (specifically RealNVP). We apply this on Type-II Seesaw model to test the efficacy of the algorithm. We present the results of our detailed Bayesian exploration of the model parameter space subjected to theoretical constraints and experimental data corresponding to the 125 GeV Higgs boson, $\rho$-parameter, and the oblique parameters. All associated data, figures, and trained ML models can be found here: https://github.com/sunandopatra/MLNS-T2SS</description>

      <title>Implications of the first CONUS+ measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CONUS+ collaboration has reported their first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). The experiment uses reactor electron antineutrinos and germanium detectors with recoil thresholds as low as $160~\mathrm{eV_\text{ee}}$. With an exposure of $327$ kg $\times$ d, the measurement was made with a statistical significance of $3.7 \sigma$. We explore several physics implications of this observation, both within the Standard Model and in the context of new physics. We focus on a determination of the weak mixing angle, non-standard and generalized neutrino interactions both with heavy and light mediators, neutrino magnetic moments, and the up-scattering of neutrinos into sterile fermions through the sterile dipole portal and new mediators. Our results highlight the r\^ole of reactor-based CE$\nu$NS experiments in probing a vast array of neutrino properties and new physics models.</description>

      <title>Distinctive GWBs from eccentric inspiraling SMBH binaries with a DM spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14041v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) from various pulsar-timing-array (PTA) observations have renewed the interest in the inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), whose population is believed to be the most promising candidate with possible generalizations from including either orbital eccentricity or dark matter (DM) spike. In this paper, we show that the inclusion of both can further display distinctive features detectable in future PTA observations. With a typical initial eccentricity $e_0\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the inspiraling SMBHBs, even a shallow DM spike can easily drive the orbital eccentricity close to $1$, leaving behind a large turnover eccentricity when GWs begin to dominate the orbital circularization. In particular, the DM spike index $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ universally manifests itself in the characteristic strain by $h_c\sim f^{7/6-\gamma_\mathrm{sp}/3}$ in the far infrared and features a novel oscillation structure at low frequencies. Future PTA detection of such characteristics would be the smoking gun for the DM spike and even reveal the nature of DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>Observability of dynamical tides in merging eccentric neutron star binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While dynamical tides only become relevant during the last couple of orbits for circular inspirals, orbital eccentricity can increase their impact during earlier phases of the inspiral by exciting tidal oscillations at each close encounter. We investigate the effect of dynamical tides on the orbital evolution of eccentric neutron star binaries using post-Newtonian numerical simulations and construct an analytic stochastic model that reproduces the numerical results. Our study reveals a strong dependence of dynamical tides on the pericenter distance, with the fractional energy transferred to dynamical tides over that dissipated in gravitational waves (GWs) exceeding $\sim1\%$ at separations $r_\mathrm{p}\lesssim50$ km for large eccentricities. We demonstrate that the effect of dynamical tides on orbital evolution can manifest as a phase shift in the GW signal. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the GW phase shift can reach the detectability threshold of $8$ with a single aLIGO detector at design densitivity for eccentric neutron star binaries at a distance of $40$ Mpc. This requires a pericenter distance of $r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim68$ km ($r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim76$ km) at binary formation with eccentricity close to $1$ for a reasonable tidal deformability and f-mode frequency of $500$ and $1.73$ kHz ($700$ and $1.61$ kHz), respectively. The observation of the phase shift will enable measuring the f-mode frequency of neutron stars independently from their tidal deformability, providing significant insights into neutron star seismology and the properties of the equation of state. We also explore the potential of distinguishing between equal-radius and twin-star binaries, which could provide an opportunity to reveal strong first-order phase transitions in the nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent searches for parity breaking in the galaxy four-point correlation function, as well as the prospects for greatly improved sensitivity to parity breaking in forthcoming surveys, motivate the search for physical mechanisms that could produce such a signal. Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy four-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral gravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would be detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to the primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this mechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy survey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>De Sitter space constraints on brane tensions and couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of bounds on the tensions of $p$-branes in de Sitter space in terms of the Hubble rate and the strength of a class of Chern-Simons-like couplings. The world-volume couplings involve Abelian 1-form gauge fields in the bulk and possibly field strengths intrinsic to the brane. In many cases these couplings are the D-brane Chern-Simons terms present in string theory, while in other cases they are the interactions of axion domain walls with $U(1)$ fields. Our arguments use the same logic and assumptions as the recent Festina Lente proposal (thus utilizing the properties of Nariai de Sitter black holes) and generalize it to extended objects, thereby providing a bottom-up set of constraints independent of any particular UV completion. We compare these bounds to the properties of (wrapped) D-branes in Type II string theory in the weak coupling limit, under the assumption that these properties are not modified significantly in de Sitter constructions. We find that all constraints are satisfied by D-branes, providing further evidence for the Festina Lente conjecture. For the particular case of 2-branes with Chern-Simons interactions we obtain a bound, which however can be evaded if the theory contains a light axion. Similarly, we find the bounds do not apply to axion domain walls due to the presence of the axion.</description>

      <title>Black Holes from Fermi Ball Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi balls are non-topological solitons that can naturally form in an early universe containing a dark sector with heavy fermions and an attractive interaction mediated by a light scalar field. We compute the Fermi ball mass and radius scaling relations when the potential of the scalar field $\varphi$ has a non-negligible quartic coupling $\lambda\varphi^4$. The resulting Fermi balls reach `saturation' very rapidly, even when their radius is much smaller than the effective Yukawa force range. These objects can therefore grow by mergers or by accretion of ambient dark fermions, until they become so dense that they fall within their Schwarzschild radius and collapse to black holes. This setup, therefore, provides an example of a rather natural and economical dark sector scenario for the formation of primordial black holes.</description>
