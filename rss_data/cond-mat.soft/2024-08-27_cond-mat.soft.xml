      <title>Simulation of the THF hydrate-water interfacial free energy from computer simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate-water interfacial free energy is determined at $500\,\text{bar}$, at one point of the univariant two-phase coexistence line of the THF hydrate, by molecular dynamics simulation. The Mold Integration-Host methodology, an extension of the original Mold Integration technique to deal with hydrate-fluid interfaces, is used to calculate the interfacial energy. Water is described using the well-known TIP4P/Ice model and THF is described using a rigid version of the TraPPE model. We have recently used the combination of these two models to accurately describe the univariant two-phase dissociation line of the THF hydrate, in a wide range of pressures, from computer simulation [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 164718 (2024)]. The THF hydrate-water interfacial free energy predicted in this work is compared with the only experimental data available in the literature. The value obtained, $27(2)\,\text{mJ/m}^{2}$, is in excellent agreement with the experimental data taken from the literature, $24(8)\,\text{mJ/m}^{2}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the THF hydrate-water interfacial free energy is predicted from computer simulation. This work confirms that the Mold Integration technique can be used with confidence to predict solid-fluid interfaces of complex structures, including hydrates that exhibit sI and sII crystallographic structures.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilized form chirality in curved rod nematics: structure and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite almost a century of anticipation, polar uniaxial nematics were only recently discovered and shown to adopt a chiral supramolecular structure. Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods-form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation violates splay- and twist-bend continuum elasticity. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of the square-well fluid from molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have calculated self-diffusion and shear viscosity, two of the most important transport properties, of the spherical square-well (SW) fluid interacting with potential range $\lambda = 1.5 \, \sigma$. To this end, we have used a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and the continuous version of the square-well (CSW) intermolecular potential recently proposed by Zer\'on et al. [Mol. Phys. 116, 3355 (2018)]. In addition to that, we have also determined a number of equilibrium properties, including internal energy, compressibility factor, radial distribution function, and coordination number. All properties are evaluated in a wide range of temperatures and densities, including subcritical and supercritical thermodynamic conditions. Results obtained in this work show an excellent agreement with available data reported in the literature and demonstrate that the CSW intermolecular potential can be used in molecular dynamics simulations to emulate SW transport properties with confidence.</description>

      <title>Dissociation line and driving force for nucleation of the nitrogen hydrate from computer simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we determine the dissociation line of the nitrogen (N$_2$) hydrate by computer simulation using the TIP4P/Ice model for water and the TraPPE force field for N$_2$. We use the solubility method proposed recently by some of us to evaluate the dissociation temperature of the hydrate at different pressures, from 500 to 1500 bar. Particularly, we calculate the solubility of N$_2$ in the aqueous solution when it is in contact with a N$_2$-rich liquid phase and when in contact with the hydrate phase via planar interfaces as functions of temperature. Since the solubility of N$_2$ decreases with temperature in the first case and increases with temperature in the second case, both curves intersect at a certain temperature that determines the dissociation temperature at a given pressure. We find a good agreement between the predictions obtained in this work and the experimental data taken from the literature in the range of pressures considered in this work. From our knowledge of the solubility curves of N$_2$ in the aqueous solution, we also determine the driving force for nucleation of the hydrate, as a function of temperature, at different pressures. In particular, we use two different thermodynamic routes to evaluate the change in chemical potential for hydrate formation. Although the driving force for nucleation slightly decreases (in absolute value) when the pressure is increased, our results indicate that the effect of pressure can be considered negligible in the range of pressures studied in this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the driving force for nucleation of a hydrate that exhibits crystallographic structure sII, along its dissociation line, is studied from computer simulation.</description>

      <title>Diffusing Wave Microrheology in Polymeric Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in determining the viscoelastic properties of polymeric liquids and other complex fluids by means of Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS). In this technique, light-scattering spectroscopy is applied to highly turbid fluids containing optical probe particles. The DWS spectrum is used to infer the time-dependent mean-square displacement and time-dependent diffusion coefficient $D$ of the probes. From $D$, values for the storage modulus $G'(\omega)$ and the loss modulus $G''(\omega)$ are obtained. This paper is primarily concerned with the inference of the mean-square displacement from a DWS spectrum. However, in much of the literature, central to the inference that is said to yield $D$ is an invocation $g^{(1)}(t) = \exp(- 2 q^{2} \overline{X(t)^{2}})$ of the Gaussian Approximation for the field correlation function $g^{(1)}(t)$ of the scattered light in terms of the mean-square displacement $\overline{X(t)^{2}}$ of a probe particle during time $t$. Experiment and simulation both show that the Gaussian approximation is invalid for probes in polymeric liquids and other complex fluids. In this paper, we obtain corrections to the Gaussian approximation that will assist in interpreting DWS spectra of probes in polymeric liquids. The corrections reveal that these DWS spectra receive contributions from higher moments $\overline{X(t)^{2n}}$, $n &gt;1$, of the probe displacement distribution function.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of bacterial upstream swimming in macromolecular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many bacteria live in natural and clinical environments with abundant macromolecular polymers. Macromolecular fluids commonly display viscoelasticity and non-Newtonian rheological behavior; it is unclear how these complex-fluid properties affect bacterial transport in flows. Here we combine high-resolution microscopy and numerical simulations to study bacterial response to shear flows of various macromolecular fluids. In stark contrast to the case in Newtonian shear flows, we found that flagellated bacteria in macromolecular flows display a giant capacity of upstream swimming (a behavior resembling fish swimming against current) near solid surfaces: The cells can counteract flow washing at shear rates up to ~65 $s^{-1}$, one order of magnitude higher than the limit for cells swimming in Newtonian flows. The significant enhancement of upstream swimming depends on two characteristic complex-fluid properties, namely viscoelasticity and shear-thinning viscosity; meanwhile, increasing the viscosity with a Newtonian polymer can prevent upstream motion. By visualizing flagellar bundles and modeling bacterial swimming in complex fluids, we explain the phenomenon as primarily arising from the augmentation of a "weathervane effect" in macromolecular flows due to the presence of a viscoelastic lift force and a shear-thinning induced azimuthal torque promoting the alignment of bacteria against the flow direction. Our findings shed light on bacterial transport and surface colonization in macromolecular environments, and may inform the design of artificial helical microswimmers for biomedical applications in physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>Jamming, Yielding, and Rheology during Submerged Granular Avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamming transitions and the rheology of granular avalanches in fluids are investigated using experiments and numerical simulations. Simulations use the lattice-Boltzmann method coupled with the discrete element method, providing detailed stress and deformation data. Both simulations and experiments present a perfect match with each other in carefully conducted deposition experiments, validating the simulation method. We analyze transient rheological laws and jamming transitions using our recently introduced length-scale ratio $G$. $G$ serves as a unified metric for the pressure and shear rate capturing the dynamics of sheared fluid-granular systems. Two key transition points, $G_{Y}$ and $G_{0}$, categorize the material's state into solid-like, creeping, and fluid-like states. Yielding at $G_{Y}$ marks the transition from solid-like to creeping, while $G_{0}$ signifies the shift to the fluid-like state. The $\mu-G$ relationship converges towards the equilibrium $\mu_{eq}(G)$ after $G&gt;G_0$ showing the critical point where the established rheological laws for steady states apply during transient conditions.</description>

      <title>Desorption of an active Brownian polymer from a homogeneous attractive surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interfacial behavior of active Brownian polymer (ABPO) is studied by Langevin dynamics simulations. On the dependence of adsorption strength and activity characterized by Peclet number (Pe), the polymer displays two typical states on the surface: adsorption and desorption states. We find the diffusion behavior of ABPO parallel to the surface yields the "active Rouse model" and activity causes the adsorption-desorption transition at a certain adsorption strength. Particular attention is paid to how the desorption time changes with the activity. At intermediate activity, desorption time displays an exponential decay with the inverse of effective temperature. Further, we observed a non-monotonic dependence of desorption time on the rotation diffusion coefficient of the monomer and found it exists a scaling relation with chain length N. Our results highlight the activity can be used to regulate the polymer adsorption and desorption behavior.</description>

      <title>Phantom chain simulations for fracture of star polymer networks on the effect of arm molecular weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite many efforts, the fracture of network polymers under extension is yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the effect of strand molecular weight on the fracture characteristics of the networks made from star-branched prepolymers with various node functionalities $3 \le f \le 8$ and conversion ratios $0.6 \le {\phi}_c \le 0.95$ via molecular simulations with phantom chains. The networks were created via end-linking reactions of star polymers with the arm molecular weight $N_a$ = 2, 5, and 10, simulated by a Brownian dynamics scheme. The cycle rank of the percolated network ${\xi}$ was entirely consistent with the mean-field theory, implying that the reaction occurred independently and the network connectivity was statistically fair. Afterward, the networks were alternatively subjected to energy minimization and uniaxial stretch until the break. From the stress-strain curves recorded during the stretch, the stretch and stress at the break, ${\lambda}_b$ and ${\sigma}_b$, and work for fracture $W_b$ were obtained. For these values, the following relations were found: ${\lambda}_b \sim N_a^{(1/2)} {\xi}^{(-1/3)}$, ${\sigma}_b \sim {\nu}_{br} N_a^{(4/3)} {\xi}^{(2/3)}$, and $W_b \sim {\nu}_{br} N_a^{(4/3)} {\xi}^{(2/3)}$, where ${\nu}_{br}$ is the branch point density.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid phase separation at the interface of an evaporating droplet; formation of a regular lattice pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation alters the molecular interactions and leads to phase separation within the evaporating liquid. The question of whether evaporation could lead to specific phase separation at the liquid interface and eventually to the formation of patterns in small liquid volumes remains unaddressed. In this study, we investigated the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of an organic polymeric monomer in a salt-containing buffer within an evaporating sessile droplet. We observed that LLPS occurs at the dynamic interface of the droplet and leads to the formation of polymeric coacervates or regular lattice patterns depending on the initial concentration of the polymer. Our results show that the interaction of salt with the polymeric monomers at the droplet interface can lead to LLPS and the formation of regular patterns. This study suggests that the sessile droplet setup can be utilized to achieve very regular patterns as a result of LLPS.</description>

      <title>Tension-induced giant actuation in unstructured elastic sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buckling is normally associated with a compressive load applied to a slender structure; from railway tracks in extreme heat [1] to microtubules in cytoplasm [2], axial compression is relieved by out-of-plane buckling. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to structured thin sheets leads to transverse motion that may be harnessed for novel applications. For instance, tension in one direction can actuate motion in an orthogonal direction, enabling the creation of kirigami grippers [3], `groovy metasheets' for multi-stable morphing [4], and lateral bending of ribbed sheets [5]. Qualitatively similar behaviour has also been observed in simulations of thermalized graphene sheets [6,7], where clamping along one edge leads to tilting in the transverse direction. Here, we show that this counter-intuitive behaviour is, in fact, generic for thin sheets that have a relatively low stretching modulus compared to the bending modulus, which allows `giant actuation' with moderate strain. Indeed, transverse buckling can be induced by uni-axial tension even in unstructured elastic sheets, provided that the axial loading is sufficiently close to localized. We therefore refer to this as `Tension indUced Giant actuation' (TUG actuation) and study its properties. We show that TUG actuation occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression and determine scaling results for the transverse angle as a function of applied strain; our scaling results compare favorably with both experiments and simulations. Our findings suggest that controlled buckling in tension can be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures to give TUG actuation, potentially expanding the scope of its application in material science and engineering.</description>

Abstract: Lipid membranes have complex compositions and modeling the thermodynamic properties of multi-component lipid systems remains a remote goal. In this work we attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to two-dimensional simple fluid mixtures. By computing and analysing the density fluctuations of this model lipid bilayer we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term appearing in a model of regular solutions for the DPPC-DLiPC pair of lipids at three different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop control of active nematic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living things enact control of non-equilibrium, dynamical structures through complex biochemical networks, accomplishing spatiotemporally-orchestrated physiological tasks such as cell division, motility, and embryogenesis. While the exact minimal mechanisms needed to replicate these behaviors using synthetic active materials are unknown, controlling the complex, often chaotic, dynamics of active materials is essential to their implementation as engineered life-like materials. Here, we demonstrate the use of external feedback control to regulate and control the spatially-averaged speed of a model active material with time-varying actuation through applied light. We systematically vary the controller parameters to analyze the steady-state flow speed and temporal fluctuations, finding the experimental results in excellent agreement with predictions from both a minimal coarse-grained model and full nematohydrodynamic simulations. Our findings demonstrate that proportional-integral control can effectively regulate the dynamics of active nematics in light of challenges posed by the constituents, such as sample aging, protein aggregation, and sample-to-sample variability. As in living things, deviations of active materials from their steady-state behavior can arise from internal processes and we quantify the important consequences of this coupling on the controlled behavior of the active nematic. Finally, the interaction between the controller and the intrinsic timescales of the active material can induce oscillatory behaviors in a regime of parameter space that qualitatively matches predictions from our model. This work underscores the potential of feedback control in manipulating the complex dynamics of active matter, paving the way for more sophisticated control strategies in the design of responsive, life-like materials.</description>

Abstract: Bacteria often exhibit upstream swimming, which can cause the contamination of biomedical devices and the infection of organs including the urethra or lungs. This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in Newtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids that contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we investigate the rheotatic behavior of E. coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotatic data in both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids.</description>

      <title>A structural determinant of the behavior of water at hydration and nanoconfinement conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid water is reluctant to lose hydrogen-bond coordination. Here we reveal that it also demands contraction and reorientation of the second molecular shell to compensate for coordination defects. Such molecular principle will be shown to lie at the heart of the two-liquids scenario and to determine the behavior of water in hydration and nanoconfinement. Furthermore, it allows to define conditions for wettability (quantifying hydrophobicity and predicting drying transitions), thus opening the possibility to elucidate the active role of water in central fields of research.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and rheological training and memory of nanocolloidal soft glasses under cyclic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An intrinsic feature of disordered and out-of-equilibrium materials, such as glasses, is the dependence of their properties on their history. An important example is rheological memory, in which disordered solids obtain properties based on their mechanical history. Here, we employ x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) with \textit{in situ} rheometry to characterize memory formation in a nanocolloidal soft glass due to cyclic shear. During a cycle, particles undergo irreversible displacements composed of a combination of shear-induced diffusion and strain fields. The magnitudes of these displacements decrease with each cycle before reaching a steady state where the microstructure has become trained to achieve enhanced reversibility. The displacements resemble a random walk in which the directions in each cycle are independent of those in preceding cycles. Accompanying the training is a steady decrease in the dissipation during each cycle towards a steady state value. Memory of this training is revealed by measurements in which the amplitude of the shear is changed after steady state is reached. The magnitude of the particle displacements as well as the dissipation and the change in residual stress vary non-monotonically with the new strain amplitude, having minima near the training amplitude, thereby revealing both microscopic and macroscopic signatures of memory.</description>

      <title>Modelling of initially stressed solids: structure of the energy density in the incompressible limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the modelling of elastic bodies, particularly when the relaxed configuration is unknown or non-existent. We adopt the theory of initially stressed materials, incorporating the deformation gradient and stress state of the reference configuration (initial stress tensor) into the response function. We show that for the theory to be applicable, the response function of the relaxed material is invertible up to an element of the material symmetry group. Additionally, we establish that commonly imposed constitutive restrictions, namely the initial stress compatibility condition and initial stress reference independence, naturally arise when assuming the initial stress is generated solely from elastic distortion. The paper delves into modelling aspects concerning incompressible materials, showcasing the expressibility of strain energy density as a function of the deviatoric part of the initial stress tensor and the isochoric part of the deformation gradient. This not only reduces the number of independent invariants in the energy functional, but also enhances numerical robustness in finite element simulations. The findings of this research hold significant implications for modelling materials with initial stress, extending potential applications to areas such as mechanobiology, soft robotics, and 4D printing.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Field Model of Cells on a Substrate: From 3D to 2D</title>

Abstract: Multiphase field models have emerged as an important computational tool for understanding biological tissue while resolving single-cell properties. While they have successfully reproduced many experimentally observed behaviors of living tissue, the theoretical underpinnings have not been fully explored. We show that a two-dimensional version of the model, which is commonly employed to study tissue monolayers, can be derived from a three-dimensional version in the presence of a substrate. We also show how viscous forces, which arise from friction between different cells, can be included in the model. Finally, we numerically simulate a tissue monolayer, and find that intercellular friction tends to solidify the tissue.</description>

      <title>The Role of Excitations in Supercooled Liquids: Density, Geometry, and Relaxation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy excitations play a key role in all condensed-matter systems, yet there is limited understanding of their nature in glasses, where they correspond to local rearrangements of groups of particles. Here we introduce an algorithm to systematically uncover these excitations up to the activation energy scale relevant to structural relaxation. We use it in a model system to measure the density of states on a scale never achieved before, confirming that this quantity shifts to higher energy under cooling, precisely as the activation energy does. Secondly, we show that the excitations' energetic and spatial features allow one to predict with great accuracy the dynamic propensity, i.e. the location of future relaxation dynamics. Finally, we find that excitations have a core whose properties, including the displacement of the most mobile particle, scale as a power-law of their activation energy and are independent of temperature. Additionally, they exhibit an outer deformation field that depends on the material's stability and, therefore, on temperature. We build a scaling description of these findings. Overall, our analysis supports that excitations play a crucial role in regulating relaxation dynamics near the glass transition, effectively suppressing the transition to dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field theories while also being strongly influenced by it.</description>

      <title>Effective Viscosity of a Suspension of Hot Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particles with a temperature distribution, "hot particles", have a distinct effect on the fluid that surrounds them. The temperature gradients they create deem the fluid's viscosity spatially dependent, therefore violating the linearity of the problem, making a full description of velocity and pressure fields challenging. Using energy dissipation analysis and Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem, we show that it is still possible to study global properties of such hot suspensions. Namely, we calculate the effective viscosity of a dilute hot suspension, adding a correction that includes contributions from the bulk fluid and the particles themselves. As examples of this method, we derive the effective viscosity of a suspension of spherical particles with different heat distributions. We show that when the particles are non-Brownian and are all oriented in the same direction, the viscosity is no longer isotropic and depends on the direction of the shear relative to the orientation of the particles. If the particles' orientation is fixed due to an external field, the stress tensor is no longer symmetric, and the viscosity has odd components.</description>

      <title>Harmonic chain far from equilibrium: single-file diffusion, long-range order, and hyperuniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In one dimension, particles can not bypass each other. As a consequence, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) in equilibrium shows sub-diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2}$, instead of normal diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t$. This phenomenon is the so-called single-file diffusion. Here, we investigate how the above equilibrium behaviors are modified far from equilibrium. In particular, we want to uncover what kind of non-equilibrium driving force can suppress diffusion and achieve the long-range crystalline order in one dimension, which is prohibited by the Mermin-Wagner theorem in equilibrium. For that purpose, we investigate the harmonic chain driven by the following four types of driving forces that do not satisfy the detailed balance: (i) temporally correlated noise with the noise spectrum $D(\omega)\sim \omega^{-2\theta}$, (ii) conserving noise, (iii) periodic driving force, and (iv) periodic deformations of particles. For the driving force (i) with $\theta&gt;-1/4$, we observe ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2+2\theta}$ for large $t$. On the other hand, for the driving forces (i) with $\theta&lt;-1/4$ and (ii)-(iv), MSD remains finite. As a consequence, the harmonic chain exhibits the crystalline order even in one dimension. Furthermore, the density fluctuations of the model are highly suppressed in a large scale in the crystal phase. This phenomenon is known as hyperuniformity. We discuss that hyperuniformity of the noise fluctuations themselves is the relevant mechanism to stabilize the long-range crystalline order in one dimension and yield hyperuniformity of the density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Fluids with power-law repulsion: Hyperuniformity and energy fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the equilibrium statistical mechanics of a classical fluid of point-like particles with repulsive power-law pair interactions, focusing on density and energy fluctuations at finite temperature. Such long-range interactions, decaying with inter-particle distance $r$ as $1/r^s$ in $d$ dimensions, are known to fall into two qualitatively different categories. For $s&lt;d$ ("strongly" long-range interactions) there are screening of correlations and suppression of large-wavelength density fluctuations (hyperuniformity). These effects eliminate density modes with arbitrarily large energy. For $s&gt;d$ ("weakly" long-range interactions) screening and hyperuniformity do not occur. Using scaling arguments, variational analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, we find another qualitative distinction. For $s\geq d/2$ the strong repulsion at short distances leads to enhanced small-wavelength density fluctuations, decorrelating particle positions. This prevents indefinitely negative entropy and large energy fluctuations. The distinct behaviors for $s\geq d/2$ and $s&lt;d/2$ give rise to qualitatively different dependencies of the entropy, heat capacity, and energy fluctuations on temperature and density. We investigate the effect of introducing an upper cutoff distance in the pair-potential. The effect of the cutoff on energy fluctuations is strong for $s&lt;d/2$ and negligible for $s\geq d/2$.</description>
