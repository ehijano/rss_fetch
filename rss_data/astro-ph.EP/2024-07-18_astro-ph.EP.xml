      <title>JWST reveals a rapid and strong day side variability of 55 Cancri e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the close-in rocky planet 55 Cnc e is puzzling despite having been observed extensively. Its optical and infrared occultation depths show temporal variability, in addition to a phase curve variability observed in the optical. We wish to explore the possibility that the variability originates from the planet being in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, thus showing different sides during occultations. We proposed and were awarded Cycle 1 time at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to test this hypothesis. JWST/NIRCam observed five occultations (secondary eclipses), of which four were observed within a week, of the planet simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.5 {\mu}m. While the former gives band-integrated photometry, the latter provides a spectrum between 3.9-5.0 {\mu}m. We find that the occultation depths in both bandpasses are highly variable and change between a non-detection (-5 +/- 6 ppm and 7 +/- 9 ppm) to 96 +/- 8 ppm and 119 (+34) (-19) ppm at 2.1 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m, respectively. Interestingly, the variations in both bandpasses are not correlated and do not support the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance explanation. The measured brightness temperature at 4.5 {\mu}m varies between 873-2256 K and is lower than the expected dayside temperature of bare rock with no heat re-distribution (2500 K) which is indicative of an atmosphere. Our atmospheric retrieval analysis of occultation depth spectra at 4.5 {\mu}m finds that different visits statistically favour various atmospheric scenarios including a thin outgassed CO/CO2 atmosphere and a silicate rock vapour atmosphere. Some visits even support a flat line model. The observed variability could be explained by stochastic outgassing of CO/CO2, which is also hinted by retrievals. Alternatively, the variability, observed at both 2.1 and 4.5 {\mu}m, could be the result of a circumstellar patchy dust torus generated by volcanism on the planet.</description>

      <title>Size, albedo and rotational period of the Hayabusa2# target (98943) 2001 CC21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to determine the size, albedo and rotational period of (98943) 2001 CC21, target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, using thermal data from the Spitzer Space telescope and ground based observations. The Spitzer data were acquired with the Infrared Spectrograph in the 6-38 micron range, reduced using the Spitzer pipeline and modeled with the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Modeling to determine the asteroid size and albedo. The absolute magnitude and the rotational period were determined thanks to new observations carried out at the 3.5m New Technology Telescope, at the 1.2m Observatoire de Haute Provence, and at the 0.7m Abastumani telescope. Three complete lightcurves were obtained in 2023-2024 at the last mentioned telescope. We determine an absolute magnitude of H=18.94$\pm$0.05, and a rotational period of 5.02124$\pm$0.00001 hours, with a large lightcurve amplitude of $\sim$ 0.8 mag. at a phase angle of 22$^o$, indicating a very elongated shape with estimated a/b semiaxis ratio $\geq$ 1.7, or a close-contact binary body. The emissivity of 2001 CC21 is consistent with that of silicates, and its albedo is 21.6$\pm$1.6 %. Finally, the spherical-equivalent diameter of 2001 CC21 is 465$\pm$15 m. The albedo value and emissivity here determined, coupled with results from polarimetry and spectroscopy from the literature, confirm that 2001 CC21 is an S-complex asteroid, and not a L-type, as previously suggested. The size of 2001 CC21 is less than 500 m, which is smaller than its first size estimation ($\sim$ 700 m). These results are relevant in preparation of the observing strategy of 2001 CC21 by Hayabusa2 extended mission.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Solar System as an Observed Multi-Transit System I: Characterization Limits from Analytic Timing Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system (SS) analog, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our Solar System as viewed from a distance and based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth-Moon Barycenter, as influenced by the other SS bodies, with varying noise levels and observing durations. We then retrieve the system's dynamical parameters using an approximate N-body model for transit timing shifts while considering four possible plane-parallel configurations: two planets, three planets, four planets, and five planets.
  We demonstrate that -- with the retrieval applied to simulated transit times of Venus and EMB -- we can: 1) detect Jupiter at high significance (up to 90-s timing noise); 2) measure the masses and orbits of both transiting planets (mass-ratios are down to 4-8% uncertainty for the 3-planet model) ; 3) detect Mars with more than $5\sigma$ given very high level precision (10s of seconds). To accurately characterize Jupiter, we require timing precisions of better than 30 seconds and survey durations longer than 22 years. Accurate retrieval of Mars is possible when the survey baseline is longer than 25 years. Additionally, while Jupiter's mass is underestimated in most of our simulated cases, the addition of Mars improves the posterior mass, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems if they are nearly resonant to transiting planets.
  Ultimately, these simulations will help to guide future missions -- such as PLATO, Nautilus, LUVOIR, and Ariel -- in detecting and characterizing exoplanet systems analogous to our Solar System.</description>

      <title>Probe the regolith characteristics of asteroids from 9-years infrared observations of WISE/NEOWISE: A case study of the Main-Belt Object (656) Beagle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents data processing, fitting procedure, modelling and analyzing of 9-years infrared light curves provided by the WISE/NEOWISE telescope, by which the regolith characteristics of Main-Belt Object (656) Beagle is studied. We determine Beagle's effective diameter $D_{\rm eff}=57.3^{+4.5}_{-2.2}$ km, geometric albedo $p_{\rm v}=0.05^{+0.004}_{-0.007}$, mean roughness $\theta_{\rm RMS}=44\pm4^\circ$, mean grain size $b=100^{+350}_{-90}~\mu$m, mean specific heat capacity $c_{\rm p}=173\sim516\rm~JKg^{-1}K^{-1}$, mean thermal conductivity $\kappa=0.7\sim1.3\times10^{-3}\rm~Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ and mean thermal inertia $\Gamma=14\sim32\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$. The albedo of Beagle is a little anomalous that the albedos of Beagle's neighbouring asteroids are more close to Themis, rather than Beagle itself. The W1-band near-infrared light curves don't reveal significant heterogeneous NIR features on the surface of Beagle, being inconsistent with the expectation of a family parent that has members with diverse NIR spectral types. These results add new clues of Beagle probably being an interloper or a sister, rather than the parent of its neighbouring asteroids including the first main-belt comet (MBC) 133P, hence may lead to new scenarios about the origin of famous MBC 133P. Besides, we found that asteroidal shape models from inversion of optical light curves are imperfect for modeling infrared lightcurves, thus could mislead evaluations of both the heterogeneity of regolith reflectivity at near infrared and thermophysical characteristics at thermal infrared.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Nightside Water Emission Found in Transit of Ultrahot Jupiter WASP-33b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the dayside thermal structure of ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs) is generally considered to be inverted, but their nightside thermal structure has been less explored. Here we explore the impact of nightside thermal emission on high-resolution infrared transmission spectroscopy, which should not be neglected, especially for UHJs. We present a general equation for the high-resolution transmission spectrum that includes planetary nightside thermal emission. This provides a new way to infer the thermal structure of the planetary nightside with high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Using the cross-correlation technique, we find evidence for the presence of an H$_2$O emission signature on the UHJ WASP-33b during the transit, indicating an inverted temperature structure on its nightside. Such a result suggests a stronger heat transport through the circulation than currently expected. An alternative explanation is that the rotating visible hemisphere during transit leads to the potential contribution of the limb and dayside atmospheres to the detected emission signature. In the future, the combination of high-resolution full-phase curve spectroscopic observations and general circulation models will hopefully solve this puzzle and provide a complete picture of the three-dimensional nature of the chemistry, circulation, and thermal structure of UHJs.</description>

      <title>Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment Near-Ultraviolet Transmission Spectroscopy of the Ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new near-ultraviolet (NUV, $\lambda$ = 2479 $-$ 3306 $\r{A}$) transmission spectroscopy of KELT-9b, the hottest known exoplanet, obtained with the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment ($CUTE$) CubeSat. Two transits were observed on September 28th and September 29th 2022, referred to as Visits 1 and 2 respectively. Using a combined transit and systematics model for each visit, the best-fit broadband NUV light curves are R$_{\text{p}}$/R$_{\star}$ $=$ 0.136$_{0.0146}^{0.0125}$ for Visit 1 and R$_{\text{p}}$/R$_{\star}$ $=$ 0.111$_{0.0190}^{0.0162}$ for Visit 2, appearing an average of 1.54$\times$ larger in the NUV than at optical wavelengths. While the systematics between the two visits vary considerably, the two broadband NUV light curves are consistent with each other. A transmission spectrum with 25 $\r{A}$ bins suggests a general trend of excess absorption in the NUV, consistent with expectations for ultra-hot Jupiters. Although we see an extended atmosphere in the NUV, the reduced data lack the sensitivity to probe individual spectral lines.</description>

      <title>An Earth Encounter As the Cause of Chaotic Dynamics in Binary Asteroid (35107) 1991VH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among binary asteroids, (35107) 1991VH stands out as unique given the likely chaotic rotation within its secondary component. The source of this excited dynamical state is unknown. In this work we demonstrate that a past close encounter with Earth could have provided the necessary perturbation to allow the natural internal dynamics, characterized by spin-orbit coupling, to evolve the system into its current dynamical state. In this hypothesis, the secondary of 1991VH was previously in a classical 1:1 spin-orbit resonance with an orbit period likely between 28-35 hours before being perturbed by an Earth encounter within $\sim80,000$ km. We find if the energy dissipation within the secondary is relatively inefficient, this excited dynamical state could persist to today and produce the observed ground-based measurements. Coupled with the orbital history of 1991VH, we can then place a constraint on the tidal dissipation parameters of the secondary.</description>

      <title>Challenge of direct imaging of exoplanets within structures: disentangling real signal from point source from background light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high contrast and spatial resolution requirements for directly imaging exoplanets requires effective coordination of wavefront control, coronagraphy, observation techniques, and post-processing algorithms. However, even with this suite of tools, identifying and retrieving exoplanet signals embedded in resolved scattered light regions can be extremely challenging due to the increased noise from scattered light off the circumstellar disk and the potential misinterpretation of the true nature of the detected signal. This issue pertains not only to imaging terrestrial planets in habitable zones within zodiacal and exozodiacal emission but also to young planets embedded in circumstellar, transitional, and debris disks. This is particularly true for H{\alpha} detection of exoplanets in transitional disks. This work delves into recent H{\alpha} observations of three transitional disks systems with MagAO-X, an extreme adaptive optics system for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope. We employed angular differential imaging (ADI) and simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) in combination with KLIP, a PCA algorithm in post-processing, for optimal starlight suppression and quasi-static noise removal. We discuss the challenges in protoplanet identification with MagAO-X in environments rich with scattered and reflected light from disk structures and explore a potential solution for removing noise contributions from real astronomical objects with current observation and post-processing techniques.</description>

      <title>Transition to turbulence in the wide-gap spherical Couette system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherical Couette system consists of two differentially rotating concentric spheres with a fluid filled in between. We study a regime where the outer sphere is rotating rapidly enough so that the Coriolis force is important and the inner sphere is rotating either slower or in the opposite direction with respect to the outer sphere. We numerically study the sudden transition to turbulence at a critical differential rotation seen in experiments at BTU Cottbus - Senftenberg, Germany and investigate its cause. We find that the source of turbulence is the boundary layer on the inner sphere, which becomes centrifugally unstable. We show that this instability leads to generation of small scale structures which lead to turbulence in the bulk, dominated by inertial waves, a change in the force balance near the inner boundary, the formation of a mean flow through Reynolds stresses, and consequently, to an efficient angular momentum transport. We compare our findings with axisymmetric simulations and show that there are significant similarities in the nature of the flow in the turbulent regimes of full 3D and axisymmetric simulations but differences in the evolution of the instability that leads to this transition. We find that a heuristic argument based on a Reynolds number defined using the thickness of the boundary layer as a length scale helps explain the scaling law of the variation of critical differential rotation for transition to turbulence with rotation rate observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Imaging at First-Light of the GMT: The Preliminary Design of GMagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the preliminary design of GMagAO-X, the first-light high-contrast imager planned for the Giant Magellan Telescope. GMagAO-X will realize the revolutionary increase in spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the 25 m GMT. It will enable, for the first time, the spectroscopic characterization of nearby potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets orbiting late-type stars. Additional science cases include: reflected light characterization of mature giant planets; measurement of young extrasolar giant planet variability; characterization of circumstellar disks at unprecedented spatial resolution; characterization of benchmark stellar atmospheres at high spectral resolution; and mapping of resolved objects such as giant stars and asteroids. These, and many more, science cases will be enabled by a 21,000 actuator extreme adaptive optics system, a coronagraphic wavefront control system, and a suite of imagers and spectrographs. We will review the science-driven performance requirements for GMagAO-X, which include achieving a Strehl ratio of 70% at 800 nm on 8th mag and brighter stars, and post-processed characterization at astrophysical flux-ratios of 1e-7 at 4 lambda/D (26 mas at 800 nm) separation. We will provide an overview of the resulting mechanical, optical, and software designs optimized to deliver this performance. We will also discuss the interfaces to the GMT itself, and the concept of operations. We will present an overview of our end-to-end performance modeling and simulations, including the control of segment phasing, as well as an overview of prototype lab demonstrations. Finally, we will review the results of Preliminary Design Review held in February, 2024.</description>

      <title>Star and Planet Formation with the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) Space Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) is a far-infrared space mission concept with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. Saltus consists of a 14-m inflatable primary, providing 16 times the sensitivity and 4 times the angular resolution of Herschel, and two cryogenic detectors spanning a wavelength range of 34-660 microns and spectral resolving power of 300 - 1e7. Spectroscopic observations in the far-infrared offer many unique windows into the processes of star and planet formation. These include observations of low energy water transitions, the H2 mass tracer HD, many CHONS constraining molecules such as NH3 and H2S, and emission lines from the phonon modes of molecular ices. Observing these species will allow us to build a statistical sample of protoplanetary disk masses, characterize the water snowline, identify Kuiper Belt like debris rings around other stars, and trace the evolution CHONS from prestellar cores, through to protoplanetary disks and debris disks. This paper details details several key star and planet formation science goals achievable with SALTUS.</description>

      <title>A common law for the differential rotation of planets and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All planets and stars rotate. All gas planets in our solar system, the Sun, and many stars show a pattern of east- or westward mean flows. This phenomenon is known as differential rotation in the stellar and as zonal jets in the planetary context. Observations, laboratory experiments and simulations show that the zonal flow kinetic energy scales like $\ell^{-5}$, where $\ell$ is the spherical harmonic degree (which is effectively a latitudinal wave number). Here, we analyze observation of the Sun, as well as simulations of the dynamics in Saturn and in the outer atmosphere of an ultra-hot Jupiter. While these systems are very different, they all develop strong zonal winds that obey the $\ell^{-5}$ scaling. Our results strongly suggest that there is a simple common mechanism that shapes zonal mean flows in planets and stars independent of the flow driving.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Fitting Eclipse Maps of Exoplanets with Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping uses the shape of the eclipse of an exoplanet to measure its two-dimensional structure. Light curves are mostly composed of longitudinal information, with the latitudinal information only contained in the brief ingress and egress of the eclipse. This imbalance can lead to a spuriously confident map, where the longitudinal structure is constrained by out-of-eclipse data and the latitudinal structure is wrongly determined by the priors on the map. We present a new method to address this issue. The method tests for the presence of an eclipse mapping signal by using k-fold cross-validation to compare the performance of a simple mapping model to the null hypothesis of a uniform disk. If a signal is found, the method fits a map with more degrees of freedom, optimising its information content. The information content is varied by penalising the model likelihood by a factor proportional to the spatial entropy of the map, optimised by cross-validation. We demonstrate this method for simulated datasets then apply it to three observational datasets. The method identifies an eclipse mapping signal for JWST MIRI/LRS observations of WASP-43b but does not identify a signal for JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of WASP-18b or Spitzer Space Telescope observations of HD 189733b. It is possible to fit eclipse maps to these datasets, but we suggest that these maps are overfitting the eclipse shape. We fit a new map with more spatial freedom to the WASP-43b dataset and show a flatter east-west structure than previously derived.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolving the absorption signatures of water and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b with GEMINI-S/IGRINS</title>

Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters are among the best targets for atmospheric characterization at high spectral resolution. Resolving their transmission spectra as a function of orbital phase offers a unique window into the 3D nature of these objects. In this work, we present three transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b observed with Gemini-S/IGRINS. For the first time, we measure the phase-dependent absorption signals of CO and H$_{\text{2}}$O in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, and we find that they are different. While the blueshift of CO increases during the transit, the absorption lines of H$_{\text{2}}$O become less blueshifted with phase, and even show a redshift in the second half of the transit. These measurements reveal the distinct spatial distributions of both molecules across the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. Also, we find that the H$_{\text{2}}$O signal is absent in the first quarter of the transit, potentially hinting at cloud formation on the evening terminator of WASP-121b. To further interpret the absorption trails of CO and H$_{\text{2}}$O, as well as the Doppler shifts of Fe previously measured with VLT/ESPRESSO, we compare the data to simulated transits of WASP-121b. To this end, we post-processes the outputs of global circulation models with a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. Our analysis shows that the atmosphere of WASP-121b is subject to atmospheric drag, as previously suggested by small hotspot offsets inferred from phase-curve observations. Our study highlights the importance of phase-resolved spectroscopy in unravelling the complex atmospheric structure of ultra-hot Jupiters and sets the stage for further investigations into their chemistry and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Roman FFP Revolution: Two, Three, Many Plutos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roman microlensing stands at a crossroads between its originally charted path of cataloging a population of cool planets that has subsequently become well-measured down to super-Earths, and the path of free-floating planets (FFPs), which did not exist when Roman was chosen in 2010, but by now promises revolutionary insights into planet formation and evolution via their possible connection to a spectrum of objects spanning 18 decades in mass. Until now, it was not even realized that the 2 paths are in conflict: Roman strategy was optimized for bound-planet detections, and FFPs were considered only in the context of what could be learned about them given this strategy. We derive a simple equation that mathematically expresses this conflict and explains why the current approach severely depresses detection of 2 of the 5 decades of potential FFP masses, i.e., exactly the two decades, $M_{\rm Pluto}&lt; M &lt;2\,M_{\rm Mars}$, that would tie terrestrial planets to the proto-planetary material out of which they formed. FFPs can be either truly free floating or can be bound in "Wide", "Kuiper", and "Oort" orbits, whose separate identification will allow further insight into planet formation. In the (low-mass) limit that the source radius is much bigger than the Einstein radius, $\theta_*\gg\theta_{\rm E}$, the number of significantly magnified points on the FFP light curve is $N=2\Gamma\theta_*\sqrt{1-z^2}/\mu$ --&gt; 3.0, when normalized to the adopted Roman cadence $\Gamma=4/$hr, and to source radius $\theta_*=0.3\,\mu$as, lens-source proper motion $\mu=6\,$mas/yr, and source impact parameter $z=0.5$, which are all typical values. By contrast $N=6$ are needed for an FFP detection. Thus, unless $\Gamma$ is doubled, FFP detection will be driven into the (large-$\theta_*$, small-$\mu$) corner of parameter space, reducing the detections by a net factor of 2 and cutting off the lowest-mass FFPs.</description>

      <title>Searching for the Grand Tack in Exoplanetary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The grand tack model, more generally called the Masset and Snellgrove mechanism, is a planetary migration model whereby two giant planets via interactions with their natal disk migrated to larger orbital radii. While its relevance in our own Solar System remains in question, the fact that the Masset and Snellgrove mechanism is a general hydrodynamical effect implies that it may have occurred in another planetary system. In this study I searched through exoplanet data for evidence of the Masset and Snellgrove mechanism, which requires that (1) the inner of the two planets is more massive than the outer planet; (2) the planets are sufficiently massive that their gravity-induced gap overlaps; and (3) they orbit at sufficiently close radii that their co-rotation regions also overlap. The last two requirements are met when the planets orbit with a 3:2 mean motion resonance. I do not find conclusive evidence for a grand tack-like system, but find some evidence for planet formation at the edge of a planet-induced protoplanetary disk gap in three systems.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Legacy survey of Class 0/I disks in Corona australis, Aquila, chaMaeleon, oPhiuchus north, Ophiuchus, Serpens (CAMPOS). I. Evolution of Protostellar disk radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I &amp; II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3mm observations with a resolution of 0.1$"$. This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14-18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all evolutionary classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 60\,au decreases as the protostar evolves from Class 0 to Class I. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio ($R_{\rm gas,Kep}/R_{\rm mm}$) with increasing bolometric temperature (${\rm T}_{\rm bol}$). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. However, in the Class 0 stage, the dust and gas disk sizes are similar, which allows a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.</description>
