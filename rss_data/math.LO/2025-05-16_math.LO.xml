      <title>Grzegorczyk Logic Unlocked</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article offers a fresh perspective on Grzegorczyk logic Grz, introducing a simplified axiomatization and extending the analysis to its natural modal extensions, Grz.2 and Grz.3. I develop a control statement theory for these logics, utilizing concepts such as buttons, switches, and ratchets. Through this framework, I establish that Grz.2 is characterized by finite Boolean algebras.</description>

      <title>A New Construction Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the framework of Abstract Elementary Classes ($\mathrm{AEC}$s) to introduce a new Construction Principle $\mathrm{CP}(\mathbf{K},\ast)$, which strictly generalises the Construction Principle of Eklof, Mekler and Shelah and allows for many novel applications beyond the setting of universal algebra. In particular, we show that $\mathrm{CP}(\mathbf{K},\ast)$ holds in the classes of free products of cyclic groups of fixed order, direct sums of a fixed torsion-free abelian group of rank 1 which is not $\mathbb{Q}$, (infinite) free $(k,n)$-Steiner systems, and (infinite) free generalised $n$-gons. From this we derive, in ZFC, that these classes of structures are not axiomatisable in the logic $\mathfrak{L}_{\infty,\omega_1}$, and, under $V=L$, that they are not axiomatisable in $\mathfrak{L}_{\infty,\infty}$.</description>

      <title>An algebraic theory of {\omega}-regular languages, via {\mu}{\nu}-expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternating parity automata (APAs) provide a robust formalism for modelling infinite behaviours and play a central role in formal verification. Despite their widespread use, the algebraic theory underlying APAs has remained largely unexplored. In recent work, a notation for non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) was introduced, along with a sound and complete axiomatisation of their equational theory via right-linear algebras. In this paper, we extend that line of work, in particular to the setting of infinite words. We present a dualised syntax, yielding a notation for APAs based on right-linear lattice expressions, and provide a natural axiomatisation of their equational theory with respect to the standard language model of {\omega}-regular languages. The design of this axiomatisation is guided by the theory of fixed point logics; in fact, the completeness factors cleanly through the completeness of the linear-time {\mu}-calculus.</description>

      <title>A Structural Analysis of Infinity in Set Theory and Modern Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained analysis of infinity from two mathematical perspectives: set theory and algebra. We begin with cardinal and ordinal numbers, examining deep questions such as the continuum hypothesis, along with foundational results such as the Schr\"oder-Bernstein theorem, multiple proofs of the well-ordering of cardinals, and various properties of infinite cardinals and ordinals. Transitioning to algebra, we analyze the interplay between finite and infinite algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and $R$-modules. Major results, such as the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, Krull's Theorem, Hilbert's basis theorem, and the equivalence of free and projective modules over principal ideal domains, highlight the connections and differences between finite and infinite structures, as well as demonstrating the relationship between set-theoretic and algebraic treatments of infinity. Through this approach, we provide insights into how key results about infinity interact with and inform one another across set-theoretic and algebraic mathematics.</description>

      <title>Homological Invariants of Higher-Order Equational Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many first-order equational theories, such as the theory of groups or boolean algebras, can be presented by a smaller set of axioms than the original one. Recent studies showed that a homological approach to equational theories gives us inequalities to obtain lower bounds on the number of axioms. In this paper, we extend this result to higher-order equational theories. More precisely, we consider simply typed lambda calculus with product and unit types and study sets of equations between lambda terms. Then, we define homology groups of the given equational theory and show that a lower bound on the number of equations can be computed from the homology groups.</description>
