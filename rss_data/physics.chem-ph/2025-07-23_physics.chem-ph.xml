      <title>Toward Routine CSP of Pharmaceuticals: A Fully Automated Protocol Using Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is a useful tool in pharmaceutical development for identifying and assessing risks associated with polymorphism, yet widespread adoption has been hindered by high computational costs and the need for both manual specification and expert knowledge to achieve useful results. Here, we introduce a fully automated, high-throughput CSP protocol designed to overcome these barriers. The protocol's efficiency is driven by Lavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained specifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This NNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based workflow. We validate this CSP protocol on an extensive retrospective benchmark of 49 unique molecules, almost all of which are drug-like, successfully generating structures that match all 110 $Z' = 1$ experimental polymorphs. The average CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours, which is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical utility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that resolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that successfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder X-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time and cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug discovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization. Rapid turnaround times and high throughput also enable CSP that can be run in parallel with experimental screening, providing chemists with real-time insights to guide their work in the lab.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transition State Refinement with Learned Equilibrium Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying transition states (TSs), the high-energy configurations that molecules pass through during chemical reactions, is essential for understanding and designing chemical processes. However, accurately and efficiently identifying these states remains one of the most challenging problems in computational chemistry. In this work, we introduce a new generative AI approach that improves the quality of initial guesses for TS structures. Our method can be combined with a variety of existing techniques, including both machine learning models and fast, approximate quantum methods, to refine their predictions and bring them closer to chemically accurate results. Applied to TS guesses from a state-of-the-art machine learning model, our approach reduces the median structural error to just 0.088 $\unicode{x212B}$ and lowers the median absolute error in reaction barrier heights to 0.79 kcal mol$^{-1}$. When starting from a widely used tight-binding approximation, it increases the success rate of locating valid TSs by 41\% and speeds up high-level quantum optimization by a factor of three. By making TS searches more accurate, robust, and efficient, this method could accelerate reaction mechanism discovery and support the development of new materials, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.</description>

      <title>A charge-density machine-learning workflow for computing the infrared spectrum of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning workflow for the calculation of the infrared spectrum of molecules, and more generally of other temperature-dependent electronic observables. The main idea is to use the Jacobi-Legendre cluster expansion to predict the real-space charge density of a converged density-functional-theory calculation. This gives us access to both energy and forces, and to electronic observables such as the dipole moment or the electronic gap. Thus, the same model can simultaneously drive a molecular dynamics simulation and evaluate electronic quantities along the trajectory, namely it has access to the same information of ab-initio molecular dynamics. A similar approach within the framework of machine-learning force fields would require the training of multiple models, one for the molecular dynamics and others for predicting the electronic quantities. The scheme is implemented here within the numerical framework of the PySCF code and applied to the infrared spectrum of the uracil molecule in the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ethanol and Methanol on NOx Emissions in Ammonia-Methane Combustion: ReaxFF Simulations and ML-Based Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of ammonia-methane (NH3-CH4) combustion as a hydrogen-carrier energy source faces major challenges such as significant NOx emissions, hindering its practical implementation. This paper examines how ethanol (C2H6O) and methanol (CH4O) additives influence formation pathways of NOx using ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at temperatures of 2,000 K and 3,000 K. Ten carefully designed fuel mixtures (C1-C10) were evaluated across 0%, 5%, and 10% alcohol concentrations. The findings show that adding alcohol can effectively suppress NOx production, especially at elevated temperatures. At 3,000 K, 10% ethanol addition and 10% methanol addition reduced the production of NOx by approximately 39.6% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the base fuel. This suppression is attributed to the charge redistribution and the redirection of nitrogen intermediates through stabilising pathways such as HNO, HNO2, and N2O. Simulation-derived descriptors served as the training data for machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN). RFR achieved superior performance compared with other models with an R2 of 0.993 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.661. The trained ML models successfully predicted NOx emissions for both simulated alcohol ratios (0%, 5% and 12%), and non-simulated alcohol ratios (2%, 7%, and 12%) which demonstrating how hybrid physics-informed ML algorithms can extrapolate complex chemical behaviours, along with prediction errors under 5% for most extrapolated ethanol cases. The results showcase that the ReaxFF informed ML framework successfully serves as a basis for designing cleaner fuels and is capable of establishing a reliable structure for future predictive models in combustion chemistry.</description>

      <title>Chemical Control for the Morphogenesis of Conducting Polymer Dendrites in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conducting polymer dendrite (CPD) morphogenesis is an electrochemical process that unlocks the potential to implement in materio evolving intelligence in electrical systems: As an electronic device experiences transient voltages in an open-space wet environment, electrically conductive structures physically change over time, programming the filtering properties of an interconnect as a non-linear analog device. Mimicking the self-preservation strategies of some sessile organisms, CPDs adapt their morphology to the environment they grow in. Either studied as an electrochemical experiment or as neuromorphic devices, the dependence of CPDs' electrical properties on the chemical nature of their environment is still unreported, despite the inter-dependence between the electrical properties of the electrogenerated material and the chemical composition of their growth medium. In this study, we report on the existing intrication between the nature and concentration of the electrolytes, electroactive compounds and co-solvents and the electrical and the electrochemical properties of CPDs in water. CPDs exhibit various chemical sensitivities in water: their morphology is highly dependent on the nature of the chemical resources available in their environment. The selection of these resources therefore critically influence morphogenesis. Also, concentrations have different impacts on growth dynamics, conditioning the balance between thermodynamic and kinetic control on polymer electrosynthesis. By correlating the dependencies of these evolving objects with the availability of the chemical resources in an aqueous environment, this study proposes guidelines to tune the degree of evolution of electronic materials in water. Such hardware is envisioned to exploit the chemical complexity of real world environments as part of information processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Super-capacitors interfaced with quantum dots at the electrolyte/electrode interface: capacitance gain and fluorescence line-width narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, we have observed an overall capacitance enhancement in super capacitors (S-C) when placing small amount of conductive colloids at the electrolyte/electrode interface with a mass ratio of 1:5000 to the electrode mass. The capacitance peaked at particular colloid concentration and the enhancement was attributed to local field effects by formation of an array of colloids at the interface. Here we show that fluorescing semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) at the interface exhibit similar effects on the cell capacitance with a capacitance amplification, measure by cyclic voltammetry (C-V), of more than 2.5 at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Embedding QDs at the electrolyte/electrode interface has an added value that it may be further enhanced by white light and indeed this is the case here. The effect was also correlated with resonating effect (large signal enhancement) and in the case of wet samples, with line narrowing of the dots' fluorescence; the latter indicates a substantial fluorescence gain. Probing the electrolyte/electrode interface with fluorescing materials adds to our basic knowledge of the interface and could be useful for light-sensitive S-C cells.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations in a polar fluid: confronting stochastic density functional theory to simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a Stochastic Density Functional Theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory's validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.</description>

      <title>Perovskite-R1: A Domain-Specialized LLM for Intelligent Discovery of Precursor Additives and Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization. Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials, processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.</description>

      <title>Stable and Accurate Orbital-Free DFT Powered by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hohenberg and Kohn have proven that the electronic energy and the one-particle electron density can, in principle, be obtained by minimizing an energy functional with respect to the density. While decades of theoretical work have produced increasingly faithful approximations to this elusive exact energy functional, their accuracy is still insufficient for many applications, making it reasonable to try and learn it empirically. Using rotationally equivariant atomistic machine learning, we obtain for the first time a density functional that, when applied to the organic molecules in QM9, yields energies with chemical accuracy relative to the Kohn-Sham reference while also converging to meaningful electron densities. Augmenting the training data with densities obtained from perturbed potentials proved key to these advances. This work demonstrates that machine learning can play a crucial role in narrowing the gap between theory and the practical realization of Hohenberg and Kohn's vision, paving the way for more efficient calculations in large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Aitomia: Your Intelligent Assistant for AI-Driven Atomistic and Quantum Chemical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running atomistic simulations, monitoring their computational status, analyzing simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in both textual and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting large language models that leverage the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground-state to excited-state calculations, including geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectral calculations. The multi-agent implementation enables autonomous executions of the complex computational workflows, such as the computation of the reaction enthalpies. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz). It may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, thereby democratizing simulations and accelerating research and development in relevant fields.</description>

      <title>Extending Nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functionals to Isolated Systems via a Density-Functional-Dependent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.</description>
