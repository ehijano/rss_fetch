      <title>Two-dimensional discrete operators and rational functions on algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a connection between finite-gap on one energy level two-dimensional Schrodinger operators and two-dimensional discrete operators. We find spectral data for a new class of two-dimensional integrable discrete operators. These operators have eigenfunctions on zero level energy parameterized by points of algebraic spectral curves. In the case of genus one spectral curves we show that the finite-gap Schrodinger operators can be obtained as a limit of the discrete operators.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for quad equations II: tetrahedron and octahedron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form associated to the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. These include the triangle Lagrangian that has traditionally been used in the Lagrangian multiform description of ABS equations, the trident Lagrangian that was central to Part I of this paper, and two Lagrangians that have not been studied in the multiform setting. Two of the Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations and one produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the well-established Lagrangian 2-form for these equations, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations).
  We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>
