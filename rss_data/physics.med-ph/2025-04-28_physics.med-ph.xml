      <title>A Noise-Robust Model-Based Approach to T-Wave Amplitude Measurement and Alternans Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T-wave alternans (TWA) is a potential marker for sudden cardiac death, but its reliable analysis is often constrained to noise-free environments, limiting its utility in real-world settings. We explore model-based T-wave estimation to mitigate the impact of noise on TWA level. Detection was performed using a previous surrogate-based method as a benchmark and a new method based on a Markov model state transition matrix (STM). These were combined with a Modified Moving Average (MMA) method and polynomial T-wave modeling to enhance noise robustness. Methods were tested across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), from -5 to 30 dB, and different noise types: baseline wander (BW), muscle artifacts (MA), electrode movement (EM), and respiratory modulation. Synthetic ECGs with known TWA levels were used: 0 uV for TWA-free and 30-72 uV for TWA-present signals. T-wave modeling improved estimation accuracy under noisy conditions. With EM noise at SNRs of -5 and 5 dB, mean absolute error (MAE) dropped from 62 to 49 uV and 27 to 25 uV, respectively (Mann-Whitney-U test, p &lt; 0.05) with modeling applied. Similar improvements were seen with MA noise: MAE dropped from 100 to 70 uV and 26 to 23 uV. In detection, the STM method achieved an F1-score of 0.92, outperforming the surrogate-based method (F1 = 0.81), though both struggled under EM noise at -5 dB. Importantly, beyond SNR, detection performance depended on the number of beats analyzed. These findings show that combining model-based estimation with STM detection significantly improves TWA analysis under noise, supporting its application in ambulatory and wearable ECG monitoring.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Automatic Classifier AutoSense Sky OS for Pediatric Cochlear Implant Users using a Virtual Classroom Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluated whether AutoSense Sky OS, an automatic classifier used in pediatric Advanced Bionics cochlear implants (CIs), improves speech intelligibility from the front without significantly impairing spatial awareness (i.e., sound detection and identification from all directions), with the main focus on the classroom situation. A double-blind crossover study was conducted with 12 pediatric CI users aged 7-16 years. Participants tested two settings: one with AutoSense Sky OS activated and the other with an omnidirectional microphone mode. Speech intelligibility from the front and spatial awareness were assessed in a virtual classroom environment using a Virtual Reality headset and a 12-loudspeaker array. Participants also rated the performance of each setting during a take-home period. A technical evaluation revealed that AutoSense Sky OS activated its directional microphone mode in the virtual classroom, and during the listening test this significantly improved speech intelligibility from the front while significantly reducing spatial awareness. While not all participants reported noticeable differences between settings in daily life, 8 out of 12 children preferred "AutoSense on", perceiving improved speech intelligibility in noisy environments. Conversely, some participants preferred "AutoSense off" due to poorer localization and speech intelligibility from behind with "AutoSense on". In conclusion, the automatic classifier provided improved speech understanding in noisy conditions such as a classroom, at the cost of a slightly reduced spatial awareness. The preference for AutoSense Sky OS among CI children and their parents appears to be a matter of individual trade-offs between improved speech intelligibility in noisy conditions and reduced spatial awareness.</description>

      <title>The Foundation for Developing an Exoskeleton for the Rehabilitation of Temporomandibular Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporomandibular disorders affect a significant portion of the population, often causing pain and restricted jaw movement. Physiotherapy with active jaw exoskeletons seems to be a promising treatment approach. However, there has been limited progress in this area, with only a few studies published. The lack of detailed simulations and biomechanical jaw models in these papers impedes the design and validation of such devices. Thus, this work presents an open-source and extendable jaw model framework to support the development of jaw exoskeletons for TMD rehabilitation. The framework includes three model variants with varying complexity: a rigid body model with point-on-surface constraints, a rigid body model with mesh geometry constraints, and a hybrid model combining rigid dynamics with finite element methods. Model customization is facilitated through JSON configuration files, requiring minimal programming expertise. The framework was evaluated using experimental kinematic data from a single participant, with muscle excitations computed via PID controllers tuned through global optimization. The models successfully reproduced jaw movements without prior individualization, demonstrating their suitability for prototyping and studying exoskeleton behavior. The basic models are ideal for rapid prototyping, while the hybrid model provides insights into the effects of exoskeletons on the masticatory system. This framework establishes a foundation for advancing jaw exoskeleton development, with future work focusing on patient-specific modeling, improved anatomical detail, and tools for exoskeleton control and design. The framework code is publicly available and can be found at https://github.com/paulotto/exosim.</description>

      <title>Scattering polarimetry for correlative nerve fiber imaging and multi-modal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping the intricate network of nerve fibers is crucial for understanding brain function. Three-Dimensional Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) and Computational Scattered Light Imaging (ComSLI) map dense nerve fibers in brain sections with micrometer resolution using visible light. 3D-PLI reconstructs 3D-fiber orientations, while ComSLI disentangles multiple directions per pixel. So far, these imaging techniques have been realized in separate setups. A combination within a single device would facilitate faster measurements, pixelwise mapping, cross-validation of fiber orientations, and leverage the advantages of each technique while mitigating their limitations. Here, we introduce the Scattering Polarimeter, a microscope that facilitates correlative large-area scans by integrating 3D-PLI and ComSLI measurements into a single system. Based on a Mueller polarimeter, it incorporates variable retarders and a large-area light source for direct and oblique illumination, enabling combined 3D-PLI and ComSLI measurements. Applied to human and vervet monkey brain sections, the Scattering Polarimeter generates results comparable to state-of-the-art 3D-PLI and ComSLI setups and creates a multi-modal fiber direction map, integrating the robust fiber orientations obtained from 3D-PLI with fiber crossings from ComSLI. Furthermore, we discuss applications of the Scattering Polarimeter for unprecedented correlative and multi-modal brain imaging.</description>

      <title>Correlative Symmetric Index: An alternative mathematical evaluation for beam profile symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Current mathematical quantification methods for beam symmetry are highly sensitive to noise, especially in beam profiles with significant variation. Purpose: This study evaluates the accuracy of standard radiotherapy beam symmetry metrics and compares them to a proposed cross-correlation-based metric called the Correlative Symmetric Index (CSI), as well as the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). We aim to demonstrate that CSI is less susceptible to noise than traditional methods. Methods: Simulated non-symmetric beam profiles with similar left and right areas were analyzed using both standard and proposed symmetry metrics. To test the robustness of each method to noise, a noisy non-symmetric beam profile was also generated. Measured beam profiles at various depths in a water tank were used to compare the performance of each symmetry metric under realistic clinical conditions. Results: In the noisy, non-symmetric case, CSI and SSIM values were 0.387 and 0.5401, respectively. Traditional metrics such as the Point Difference Quotient (PDQ) and area-based symmetry yielded values of 0.312 and 0.400. The percentage change between the non-symmetric (no noise) and non-symmetric (with noise) cases for PDQ, area-based symmetry, SSIM, and CSI were 11.1%, 5.6%, 16.25%, and 1.43%, respectively. For clinically measured symmetric profiles, all metrics produced values above 0.9. Conclusion: The Correlative Symmetric Index (CSI) demonstrates greater robustness to noise than both pointwise and area-based symmetry methods. CSI provides a reliable measure for quantifying beam symmetry, particularly under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of microbial survival models under UVC exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to identify and parameterize the optimal survival curves for 33 fundamental microorganisms subject to UVC exposure through experimental measurements. We compile published data on UVC doses and corresponding survival fractions for these microorganisms to estimate parameters for four prominent survival models: Single-target (ST), Multi-target (MT), Linear Quadratic (LQ), and Two-Stage Decay (TSD). The best-fitting model for each microorganism is determined by selecting the one with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) compared to the experimental data. Our analysis indicates that the MT model is the most frequently appropriate, accurately fitting 21 of the 33 microorganisms. The TSD model is the best fit for only three, while the LQ model, though occasionally suitable at lower doses, is often excluded due to unreliable performance at higher doses. The assessed models, particularly the MT model, demonstrate strong predictive capabilities for UVC surface sterilization of microorganisms. However, caution is warranted with the LQ model at higher doses due to its potential limitations.</description>

      <title>Deformable Registration of MRA and 4D Flow Images to Facilitate Accurate Estimation of Flow Properties within Blood Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for the registration of MRA and 4D Flow images, with the goal of calculating blood flow properties using both modalities simultaneously. In particular, the method produces an alignment of segmentations of vessel networks, from MRA images, with the blood velocity field within those networks, from the corresponding 4D Flow images. The alignment procedure is driven by the registration of centerlines of vessels extracted from the two modalities. Our approach is robust to noise, small deformations, and partial omissions of vessel surfaces and/or blood velocities. The alignment procedure is tested on 7 patient data sets acquired at Texas Children's Hospital. The quality of the resulting alignment is assessed by (i) an illustration of the aligned and unaligned surface segmentations for a sample patient, (ii) histograms of distances between centerline networks, and (iii) graphs of estimated blood flow. For each of the 7 analyzed data sets, medians of the distance histograms decreased an average of 83.5%, and the estimated blood flow increased significantly as a result of the alignment procedure.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>
