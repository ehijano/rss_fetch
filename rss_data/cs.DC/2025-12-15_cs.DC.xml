      <title>An Efficient Approach for Energy Conservation in Cloud Computing Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent trends of technology have explored a numerous applications of cloud services, which require a significant amount of energy. In the present scenario, most of the energy sources are limited and have a greenhouse effect on the environment. Therefore, it is the need of the hour that the energy consumed by the cloud service providers must be reduced and it is a great challenge to the research community to develop energy-efficient algorithms. To design the same, some researchers tried to maximize the average resource utilization, whereas some researchers tried to minimize the makespan. However, they have not considered different types of resources that are present in the physical machines. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, which tries to improve utilization of resources (like CPU, disk, I/O) explicitly, which in turn increases the utilization of active resources. For this, the proposed algorithm uses a fitness value, which is a function of CPU, disk and I/O utilization, and processing time of the task. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive simulations are performed on both proposed algorithm and existing algorithm MaxUtil using synthetic datasets. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm is a better energy-efficient algorithm and consumes less energy than the MaxUtil algorithm.</description>

      <title>Agentic Operator Generation for ML ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TritorX, an agentic AI system designed to generate functionally correct Triton PyTorch ATen kernels at scale for emerging accelerator platforms. TritorX integrates open-source large language models with a custom linter, JIT compilation, and a PyTorch OpInfo-based test harness. This pipeline is compatible with both real Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) silicon and in hardware simulation environments for next-generation devices. In contrast to previous kernel-generation approaches that prioritize performance for a limited set of high-usage kernels, TritorX prioritizes coverage. Our system emphasizes correctness and generality across the entire operator set, including diverse data types, shapes, and argument patterns. In our experiments, TritorX successfully generated kernels and wrappers for 481 unique ATen operators that pass all corresponding PyTorch OpInfo tests (over 20,000 in total). TritorX paves the way for overnight generation of complete PyTorch ATen backends for new accelerator platforms.</description>

      <title>Seamless Transitions: A Comprehensive Review of Live Migration Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live migration, a technology enabling seamless transition of operational computational entities between various hosts while preserving continuous functionality and client connectivity, has been the subject of extensive research. However, existing reviews often overlook critical technical aspects and practical challenges integral to the usage of live migration techniques in real-world scenarios. This work bridges this gap by integrating the aspects explored in existing reviews together with a comprehensive analysis of live migration technologies across multiple dimensions, with focus on migration techniques, migration units, and infrastructure characteristics. Despite efforts to make live migration widely accessible, its reliance on multiple system factors can create challenges. In certain cases, the complexities and resource demands outweigh the benefits, making its implementation hard to justify. The focus of this work is mainly on container based and virtual machine-based migration technologies, examining the current state of the art and the disparity in adoption between these two approaches. Furthermore, this work explores the impact of migration objectives and operational constraints on the usability and efficacy of existing technologies. By outlining current technical challenges and providing guidelines for future research and development directions, this work serves a dual purpose: first, to equip enthusiasts with a valuable resource on live migration, and second, to contribute to the advancement of live migration technologies and their practical implementation across diverse computing environments.</description>

      <title>Reducing Fragmentation and Starvation in GPU Clusters through Dynamic Multi-Objective Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GPU clusters have become essential for training and deploying modern AI systems, yet real deployments continue to report average utilization near 50%. This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics. These results show that targeted and transparent scheduling strategies can meaningfully increase GPU efficiency in heterogeneous AI clusters and provide a practical foundation for future production scheduling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Framework for Centralized and Decentralized Aggregation Algorithm in Federated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the landscape of federated learning has witnessed significant advancements, particularly in decentralized methodologies. This research paper presents a comprehensive comparison of Centralized Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) with Decentralized Aggregated Federated Learning (AFL) and Decentralized Continual Federated Learning (CFL) architectures. While HFL, in its centralized approach, faces challenges such as communication bottlenecks and privacy concerns due to centralized data aggregation, AFL and CFL provide promising alternatives by distributing computation and aggregation processes across devices. Through evaluation of Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets, this study demonstrates the advantages of decentralized methodologies, showcasing how AFL and CFL outperform HFL in precision, recall, F1 score, and balanced accuracy. The analysis highlights the importance of decentralized aggregation mechanisms in AFL and CFL, which effectively enables collaborative model training across distributed devices. This comparative study contributes valuable insights into the evolving landscape of federated learning, guiding researchers and practitioners towards decentralized methodologies for enhanced performance in collaborative model training scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dora: QoE-Aware Hybrid Parallelism for Distributed Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of edge AI applications, satisfying user quality of experience (QoE) requirements, such as model inference latency, has become a first class objective, as these models operate in resource constrained settings and directly interact with users. Yet, modern AI models routinely exceed the resource capacity of individual devices, necessitating distributed execution across heterogeneous devices over variable and contention prone networks. Existing planners for hybrid (e.g., data and pipeline) parallelism largely optimize for throughput or device utilization, overlooking QoE, leading to severe resource inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary energy drain) or QoE violations under runtime dynamics.
  We present Dora, a framework for QoE aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI training and inference. Dora jointly optimizes heterogeneous computation, contention prone networks, and multi dimensional QoE objectives via three key mechanisms: (i) a heterogeneity aware model partitioner that determines and assigns model partitions across devices, forming a compact set of QoE compliant plans; (ii) a contention aware network scheduler that further refines these candidate plans by maximizing compute communication overlap; and (iii) a runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting overall QoEs. Across representative edge deployments, including smart homes, traffic analytics, and small edge clusters, Dora achieves 1.1--6.3 times faster execution and, alternatively, reduces energy consumption by 21--82 percent, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of GPU-Native Compilation for Rapid Code Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AI code generation systems suffer from significant latency bottlenecks due to CPU-GPU data transfers during compilation, execution, and testing phases. We establish theoretical foundations for three complementary approaches to GPU-native compilation that eliminate these transfers: (1) parallel traditional compilation adapted for GPU execution, (2) neural compilation using learned sequence-to-sequence translation with probabilistic verification, and (3) hybrid architectures combining both strategies. We derive latency and energy bounds demonstrating potential speedups of 10-100x for code iteration cycles. Our analysis shows that traditional GPU compilation provides 2-5x improvements through transfer elimination, neural compilation achieves 10-100x speedups via massive parallelism, and hybrid approaches offer practical deployment paths with guaranteed correctness. We formalize the probabilistic verification framework that enables trading compilation accuracy for parallel exploration, and discuss implications for self-improving AI systems and future analog computing substrates.</description>

      <title>RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Pruning for Distributed Closeness Centrality under Multi-Packet Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying central nodes using closeness centrality is a critical task in analyzing large-scale complex networks, yet its decentralized computation remains challenging due to high communication overhead. Existing distributed approximation techniques, such as pruning, often fail to fully mitigate the cost of exchanging numerous data packets in large network settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel enhancement to the distributed pruning method specifically designed to overcome this communication bottleneck. Our core contribution is a technique that leverages multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger, consolidated data blocks. This approach significantly reduces the number of exchanged messages and minimizes data loss without compromising the accuracy of the centrality estimates. We demonstrate that our multi-packet approach substantially outperforms the original pruning technique in both message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time, preserving the core approximation properties of the baseline method. While we observe a manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead, our findings show that this is outweighed by the gains in communication efficiency, particularly for very large networks and complex packet structures. Our work offers a more scalable and efficient solution for decentralized closeness centrality computation, promising a significant step forward for large-scale network analysis.</description>

      <title>Parallax: Runtime Parallelization for Operator Fallbacks in Heterogeneous Edge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for real-time DNN applications on edge devices necessitates faster inference of increasingly complex models. Although many devices include specialized accelerators (e.g., mobile GPUs), dynamic control-flow operators and unsupported kernels often fall back to CPU execution. Existing frameworks handle these fallbacks poorly, leaving CPU cores idle and causing high latency and memory spikes. We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models. By evaluating on five representative DNNs across three different mobile devices, Parallax achieves up to 46% latency reduction, maintains controlled memory overhead (26.5% on average), and delivers up to 30% energy savings compared with state-of-the-art frameworks, offering improvements aligned with the responsiveness demands of real-time mobile inference.</description>

Abstract: Introducing FirecREST v2, the next generation of our open-source RESTful API for programmatic access to HPC resources. FirecREST v2 delivers a 100x performance improvement over its predecessor. This paper explores the lessons learned from redesigning FirecREST from the ground up, with a focus on integrating enhanced security and high throughput as core requirements.
  We provide a detailed account of our systematic performance testing methodology, highlighting common bottlenecks in proxy-based APIs with intensive I/O operations.

      <title>Stateless Snowflake: A Cloud-Agnostic Distributed ID Generator Using Network-Derived Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snowflake-style distributed ID generators are the industry standard for producing k-ordered, unique identifiers at scale. However, the traditional requirement for manually assigned or centrally coordinated worker IDs introduces significant friction in modern container-orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. In such systems, maintaining stable worker identities requires complex stateful sets or external coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper), negating the operational benefits of stateless microservices.
  This paper presents a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates the dependency on explicit worker IDs. By deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties - specifically the container's private IPv4 address - the proposed method removes the need for centralized coordination. We introduce a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity. We validate the approach across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Evaluation results demonstrate that while the design has a theoretical single-node ceiling of approximately 64,000 TPS, in practical microservice deployments the network I/O dominates latency, resulting in end-to-end performance (approximately 31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster) comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability.</description>

      <title>ECCO: Leveraging Cross-Camera Correlations for Efficient Live Video Continuous Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video analytics address real-time data drift by continuously retraining specialized, lightweight DNN models for individual cameras. However, the current practice of retraining a separate model for each camera suffers from high compute and communication costs, making it unscalable. We present ECCO, a new video analytics framework designed for resource-efficient continuous learning. The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs. Specifically, ECCO introduces: (i) a lightweight grouping algorithm that dynamically forms and updates camera groups; (ii) a GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across different groups to improve retraining accuracy and ensure fairness; and (iii) a transmission controller at each camera that configures frame sampling and coordinates bandwidth sharing with other cameras based on its assigned GPU resources. We conducted extensive evaluations on three distinctive datasets for two vision tasks. Compared to leading baselines, ECCO improves retraining accuracy by 6.7%-18.1% using the same compute and communication resources, or supports 3.3 times more concurrent cameras at the same accuracy.</description>

However, existing PCNs suffer from liquidity fragmentation-funds locked in one channel cannot be reused elsewhere-and channel depletion, both of which limit routing efficiency and reduce transaction success rates. Multi-party channel (MPC) constructions mitigate these issues, but they typically rely on leaders or coordinators, creating single points of failure and providing only limited flexibility for inter-channel payments.
  We introduce Hypergraph-based Multi-Party Payment Channels (H-MPCs), a new off-chain construction that replaces bilateral channels with collectively funded hyperedges. These hyperedges enable fully concurrent, leaderless intra- and inter-hyperedge payments through verifiable, proposer-ordered DAG updates, offering significantly greater flexibility and concurrency than prior designs.
  Our implementation on a 150-node network demonstrates a transaction success rate of approximately 94% without HTLC expiry or routing failures, highlighting the robustness of H-MPCs.</description>

      <title>An LLVM-Based Optimization Pipeline for SPDZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Actively secure arithmetic MPC is now practical for real applications, but performance and usability are still limited by framework-specific compilation stacks, the need for programmers to explicitly express parallelism, and high communication overhead. We design and implement a proof-of-concept LLVM-based optimization pipeline for the SPDZ protocol that addresses these bottlenecks. Our front end accepts a subset of C with lightweight privacy annotations and lowers it to LLVM IR, allowing us to reuse mature analyses and transformations to automatically batch independent arithmetic operations. Our back end performs data-flow and control-flow analysis on the optimized IR to drive a non-blocking runtime scheduler that overlaps independent operations and aggressively overlaps communication with computation; when enabled, it can map batched operations to GPU kernels. This design preserves a low learning curve by using a mainstream language and hiding optimization and hardware-specific mechanics from programmers. We evaluate the system on controlled microbenchmarks against MP-SPDZ, focusing on online phase performance. Our CPU back end achieves up to 5.56 times speedup under intermediate and heavy algebraic workloads, shows strong scaling with thread count, and our GPU back end scales better as the input size increases. Overall, these results indicate that leveraging LLVM with protocol-aware scheduling is an effective architectural direction for extracting parallelism without sacrificing usability.</description>

      <title>GSplit: Scaling Graph Neural Network Training on Large Graphs via Split-Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging class of machine learning models for graphs, have gained popularity for their superior performance in various graph analytical tasks. Mini-batch training is commonly used to train GNNs on large graphs, and data parallelism is the standard approach to scale mini-batch training across multiple GPUs. Data parallel approaches contain redundant work as subgraphs sampled by different GPUs contain significant overlap. To address this issue, we introduce a hybrid parallel mini-batch training paradigm called split parallelism. Split parallelism avoids redundant work by splitting the sampling, loading, and training of each mini-batch across multiple GPUs. Split parallelism, however, introduces communication overheads that can be more than the savings from removing redundant work. We further present a lightweight partitioning algorithm that probabilistically minimizes these overheads. We implement split parallelism in GSplit and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art mini-batch training systems like DGL, Quiver, and $P^3$.</description>

      <title>Complexity at Scale: A Quantitative Analysis of an Alibaba Microservice Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microservice management and testbed research often rests on assumptions about deployments that have rarely been validated at production scale. While recent studies have begun to characterise production microservice deployments, they are often limited in breadth, do not compare findings across deployments, and lack consideration of the implications of findings for commonly held assumptions. We analyse a distributed tracing dataset from Alibaba's production microservice deployment to examine its scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. By comparing our findings to prior measurements of Meta's MSA we illustrate both convergent and divergent properties, clarifying which patterns may generalise. Our study reveals extreme architectural scale, long-tail distributions of workloads and dependencies, highly diverse functionality, substantial call graph variability, and pronounced time-varying behaviour which diverge from assumptions underlying research models and testbeds. We summarise how these observations challenge common assumptions in research on fault management, scaling, and testbed design, and outline recommendations for more realistic future approaches and evaluations.</description>

      <title>SSSP-Del: Fully Dynamic Distributed Algorithm for Single-Source Shortest Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern graphs are both large and dynamic, presenting significant challenges for fundamental queries, such as the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem. Naively recomputing the SSSP tree after each topology change is prohibitively expensive, causing on-demand computation to suffer from high latency. Existing dynamic SSSP algorithms often cannot simultaneously handle both edge additions and deletions, operate in distributed memory, and provide low-latency query results. To address these challenges, this paper presents SSSP-Del, a new vertex-centric, asynchronous, and fully distributed algorithm for dynamic SSSP. Operating in a shared-nothing architecture, our algorithm processes streams of both edge insertions and deletions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on large real-world and synthetic graphs with millions of vertices, and provide a thorough analysis by evaluating result latency, solution stability, and throughput.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Adaptive Watermark Detection System with Tile-based Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and reliable detection of generated images is critical for the responsible deployment of generative models. Existing approaches primarily focus on improving detection accuracy and robustness under various image transformations and adversarial manipulations, yet they largely overlook the efficiency challenges of watermark detection across large-scale image collections. To address this gap, we propose QRMark, an efficient and adaptive end-to-end method for detecting embedded image watermarks. The core idea of QRMark is to combine QR Code-inspired error correction with tailored tiling techniques to improve detection efficiency while preserving accuracy and robustness. At the algorithmic level, QRMark employs a Reed-Solomon error correction mechanism to mitigate the accuracy degradation introduced by tiling. At the system level, QRMark implements a resource-aware multi-channel horizontal fusion policy that adaptively assigns more streams to GPU-intensive stages of the detection pipeline. It further employs a tile-based workload interleaving strategy to overlap data-loading overhead with computation and schedules kernels across stages to maximize efficiency. End-to-end evaluations show that QRMark achieves an average 2.43x inference speedup over the sequential baseline.</description>

      <title>TD-Orch: Scalable Load-Balancing for Distributed Systems with Applications to Graph Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a task-data orchestration abstraction that supports a range of distributed applications, including graph processing and key-value stores. Given a batch of lambda tasks each requesting one or more data items, where both tasks and data are distributed across multiple machines, each task must be co-located with its target data (by moving tasks and/or data) and then executed. We present TD-Orch, an efficient and scalable orchestration framework featuring a simple application developer interface. TD-Orch employs a distributed push-pull technique, leveraging the bidirectional flow of both tasks and data to achieve scalable load balance across machines even under highly skewed data requests (data hot spots), with minimal communication overhead. Experimental results show that TD-Orch achieves up to 2.8x speedup over existing distributed scheduling baselines. Building on TD-Orch, we present TDO-GP, a distributed graph processing system for general graph problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the underlying framework. We design three families of implementation techniques to fully leverage the execution flow provided by TD-Orch. Experimental results show that TDO-GP achieves an average speedup of 4.1x over the best prior open-source distributed graph systems for general graph processing.</description>

      <title>KVSwap: Disk-aware KV Cache Offloading for Long-Context On-device Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) underpin emerging mobile and embedded AI applications like meeting and video summarization and document analysis, which often require processing multiple long-context inputs. Running an LM locally on-device improves privacy, enables offline use, and reduces cost, but long-context inference quickly hits a \emph{memory capacity wall} as the key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with context length and batch size. Existing KV-cache offloading schemes are designed to transfer cache data from GPU memory to CPU memory; however, they are not suitable for embedded and mobile systems, where the CPU and GPU (or NPU) typically share a unified memory and the non-volatile secondary storage (disk) offers limited I/O bandwidth. We present KVSwap, a software framework tailored for local devices that achieves high memory efficiency while effectively leveraging disk storage. KVSwap stores the full cache on disk, uses highly compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics. Our evaluation shows that across representative LMs and storage types, KVSwap delivers higher throughput under tight memory budgets while maintaining generation quality over existing KV cache offloading schemes.</description>

      <title>Aragog: Just-in-Time Model Routing for Scalable Serving of Agentic Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multi-stage tasks, but serving them at scale is computationally expensive given the many LLM inferences that each request must pass through. Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.</description>
