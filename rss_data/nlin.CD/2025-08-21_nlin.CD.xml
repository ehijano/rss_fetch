      <title>On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</description>

      <title>GEN2: A Generative Prediction-Correction Framework for Long-time Emulations of Spatially-Resolved Climate Extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in a Slow-Fast Paleoclimate Model for Glacial Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a deterministic variant of the Saltzman-Maasch model for Pleistocene glacial cycles, formulated as a three-dimensional dynamical system with cubic feedback in the atmospheric carbon dioxide equation. After reducing the model to a planar system on a critical manifold, we perform a detailed bifurcation analysis and identify both Hopf and Bautin (generalized Hopf) bifurcations, which govern the emergence of stable and unstable limit cycles. To analyze global transitions, we perform a rescaling of time and variables to derive a leading-order Hamiltonian system. This reduction enables the explicit construction of homoclinic orbits and the application of Melnikov's method to assess their persistence under perturbations. The analytical findings are further corroborated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Matrix logistic map: fractal spectral distributions and transfer of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard logistic map, $x'=ax(1-x)$, serves as a paradigmatic model to demonstrate how apparently simple non-linear equations lead to complex and chaotic dynamics. In this work we introduce and investigate its matrix analogue defined for an arbitrary matrix $X$ of a given order $N$. We show that for an arbitrary initial ensemble of hermitian random matrices with a continuous level density supported on the interval $[0,1]$, the asymptotic level density converges to the invariant measure of the logistic map. Depending on the parameter $a$ the constructed measure may be either singular, fractal or described by a continuous density. In a broader class of the map multiplication by a scalar logistic parameter $a$ is replaced by transforming $aX(\mathbb{I}-X)$ into $BX(\mathbb{I}-X)B^{\dagger}$, where $A=BB^{\dagger}$ is a fixed positive matrix of order $N$. This approach generalizes the known model of coupled logistic maps, and allows us to study the transition to chaos in complex networks and multidimensional systems. In particular, associating the matrix $B$ with a given graph we demonstrate the gradual transfer of chaos between subsystems corresponding to vertices of a graph and coupled according to its edges.</description>
