      <title>The Benjamin-Ono equation in the zero-dispersion limit for rational initial data: generation of dispersive shock waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading-order asymptotic behavior of the solution of the Cauchy initial-value problem for the Benjamin-Ono equation in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is obtained explicitly for generic rational initial data $u_0$. An explicit asymptotic wave profile $u^\mathrm{ZD}(t,x;\epsilon)$ is given, in terms of the branches of the multivalued solution of the inviscid Burgers equation with initial data $u_0$, such that the solution $u(t,x;\epsilon)$ of the Benjamin-Ono equation with dispersion parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$ and initial data $u_0$ satisfies $u(t,x;\epsilon)-u^\mathrm{ZD}(t,x;\epsilon)\to 0$ in the locally uniform sense as $\epsilon\to 0$, provided a discriminant inequality holds implying that certain caustic curves in the $(t,x)$-plane are avoided. In some cases this convergence implies strong $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ convergence. The asymptotic profile $u^\mathrm{ZD}(t,x;\epsilon)$ is consistent with the modulated multi-phase wave solutions described by Dobrokhotov and Krichever.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problem in function spaces with asymptotic expansions with respect to time variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of nonlinear Cauchy problem $\partial_t u_i=f_i(t,x, U, \nabla_xU )$ $u_i(0,x)= u_{i,0}(x)$ is studied in function spaces with asymptotic expansion with respect to $t$. To be specific, it is discussed in Borel summable or multisummable function space.It is recognized that these functions are important classes in asymptotic analysis. We study equations under the condition $\{f_i(t,x, U, P)\}_{i=1}^m$ are in these function spaces with respect to $t$ and show $\{u_i(t,x)\}_{i=1}^m$ have also the same summability.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to nonlocal image restoration flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence, uniqueness and initial time regularity for variational solutions to nonlocal total variation flows associated with image denoising and deblurring. In particular, we prove existence of parabolic minimisers $u$, that is,
  $$\int_0^T\int_\Omega u\partial_t\phi\,dx + \textbf{F}(u(t))\,dt\leq \int_0^T \textbf{F}(u+\phi)(t)\,dt,$$ for $\phi\in C^\infty_c(\Omega\times (0,T))$. The prototypical functional $\textbf{F}(u)$ is $\textbf{F}(u)=\textbf{TV}^{\alpha}_{\cdot}(u)+\frac{\kappa}{\zeta}\int_\Omega|u(x)-u_0(x)|^\zeta\,dx$ for $\zeta\geq 1$. Here $\textbf{TV}^{\alpha}_{\cdot}$ is a fractional total variation of either the Riesz or the Gagliardo type and the second term is a regression term. These models are based on different definitions of fractional $\textbf{BV}$ spaces that have been proposed in the literature. The notion of solution is completely variational and based on the weighted dissipation method. We demonstrate existence without smoothness assumptions on the domain and exhibit uniqueness without using strict convexity. We can also deal with fairly general fidelity or regression terms in the model. Furthermore, the method also provides a novel route to constructing solutions of the parabolic fractional $1$-Laplace equation.</description>

      <title>Geometric scattering for nonlinear wave equations on the Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a conformal scattering theory for the defocusing semilinear wave equations on the Schwarzschild spacetime. We combine the energy and pointwise decay results of solutions obtained in \cite{Yang} and a Sobolev embedding on spacelike hypersurfaces to establish the energy estimates in two sides between the energy flux of solution through the Cauchy initial hypersurface $\Sigma_0=\left\{ t=0 \right\}$ and the one through the null conformal boundaries $\mathfrak{H}^+\cup \scri^+$ (resp. $\mathfrak{H}^-\cup \scri^-$). Combining these estimates and the well-posedness of Cauchy and Goursat problems for nonlinear wave equations we provide a bounded linear and locally Lipschitz scattering operator which maps the past scattering data to the future scattering data. Our results extend also the previous works \cite{BaSeZho1990,Jo2012,Jo2019} to an asymptotically flat spacetime such as Schwarzschild spacetime which is static and spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>The fractional anisotropic Calder\'{o}n problem for a nonlocal parabolic equation on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fractional anisotropic Calder\'on problem for the nonlocal parabolic equation $(\partial_t -\Delta_g)^s u=f$ ($0&lt;s&lt;1$) on closed Riemannian manifolds. More concretely, we can determine the Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ up to isometry by using the local source-to-solution map in an arbitrarily small open cylinder in the spacetime domain. This can be regarded as a nonlocal analog of the anisotropic Calder\'on problem in the parabolic setting. We also study several useful properties for nonlocal parabolic operators by using comprehensive spectrum analysis with semigroup theory.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and global extensibility criteria for time-fractionally damped Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson with a time-fractional damping term of the type $\delta \textup{D}_t^{1-\alpha} \Delta \psit$ where we allow the challenging so-called critical case ($\delta=0$). This equation arises in the context of acoustic propagation through thermally relaxed media. We tackle the question of long-time existence of the solution. More precisely, the goal of the paper is twofold: First, we establish local well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem, where we also provide a lower bound on the final time of existence as a function of initial data. Second, we prove a regularity result which guarantees, under the hypothesis of boundedness of certain quantities, that the local solution can be extended to be global-in-time.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of fast solitary waves to the Benjamin Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the asymptotic stability of the high speed solitary waves to the Benjamin equation. This is done by establishing a Liouville property for the nonlinear evolution of the Benjamin equation around these solitary waves. To do this, inspired by Kenig-Martel-Robbiano 2011, we make use of the KdV limit of the Benjamin equation together with known rigidity property of the KdV flow. The main difficulties are linked to the presence of the Hilbert transform, that is a non-local operator, as well as the non-positivity of the quadratic part of the energy in the case $ \gamma&lt;0$ which is the physical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of small data solutions to the screened Vlasov-Poisson equation on $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d$ near vacuum. We show that for dimensions $d\geq 2$, under mild assumptions on localization (in terms of spatial moments) and regularity (in terms of at most three Sobolev derivatives) solutions scatter freely. In dimension $d=1$, we obtain a long time existence result in analytic regularity.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonlinear dispersive equations of Schr\"odinger-type involving fractional powers $0&lt;s\le 1$ of the Laplacian and a defocusing power-law nonlinearity. We conduct numerical simulations in the case of small, energy supercritical $s$ and provide evidence for a novel type of highly oscillatory singularity within the solution.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit for discrete NLS with memory effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.05681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with long-range interactions and a memory effect on the infinite lattice $h\Z$ with mesh-size $h&gt;0$. Such models are common in the study of charge and energy transport in biomolecules. Given that the distance between base pairs is small, we consider the continuum limit: a sharp approximation to the system as $h\rightarrow 0$. In this limit, we prove that solutions to this discrete equation converge strongly in $L^2$ to the solution to a continuous NLS-type equation with a memory effect, and we compute the precise rate of convergence. In order to obtain these results, we generalize some recent ideas proposed by Hong and Yang in $L^2$-based spaces to classical functional settings in dispersive PDEs involving the smoothing effect and maximal function estimates, as originally introduced in the pioneering works of Kenig, Ponce and Vega. We believe that our approach may therefore be adapted to tackle continuum limits of more general dispersive equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.08467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sharp pointwise kernel estimates and dispersive properties for the wave equation on noncompact symmetric spaces of general rank. This is achieved by combining the stationary phase method and the Hadamard parametrix, and in particular, by introducing a subtle spectral decomposition, which allows us to overcome a well-known difficulty in higher rank analysis, namely the fact that the Plancherel density is not a differential symbol in general. As consequences, we deduce the Strichartz inequality for a large family of admissible pairs and prove global well-posedness results for the corresponding semilinear equation with low regularity data as on hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to understand first-order, time-dependent mean-field games with Neumann boundary conditions, a question that remains under-explored in the literature. This matter is particularly relevant given the importance of boundary conditions in crowd models. In our model, the Neumann conditions result from players entering the domain according to a prescribed current, for instance, in a crowd entry scenario into an open-air concert or stadium. We formulate the model as a standard mean-field game coupling a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a Fokker-Planck equation. Then, we introduce a relaxed variational problem and use Fenchel-Rockafellar duality to study the relation between these problems. Finally, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the system using variational methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the isothermal stationary compressible Navier-Stokes equations on global space and cylinder domains. There are two critical exponents in such settings: The heat ratio 1 is an end point of the classical theory on weak solutions; the axisymmetric solutions in the global domain involve the critical index of Sobolev's inequality. Some new observations based on the cancellation structure of the equations are collected to get over these obstacles due to critical exponents.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with the study of the twin non-local inequalities featuring non-homogeneous differential operators $$\displaystyle -\Delta^2 u + \lambda\Delta u \geq (K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p)u^q \quad\text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N (N\geq 1),$$ and $$\displaystyle \Delta^2 u - \lambda\Delta u \geq (K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p)u^q \quad\text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N (N\geq 1),$$ with parameters $\lambda, p, q &gt;0$, $0\leq \alpha \leq N$ and $\beta&gt;\alpha-N$. In the above inequalities the potential $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ is given by $K_{\alpha, \beta}(x) = |x|^{-\alpha}\log^{\beta}(1 + |x|)$ while $K_{\alpha, \beta} * u^p$ denotes the standard convolution operator in $\mathbb{R}^N$. We discuss the existence and non-existence of non-negative solutions in terms of $N, p, q, \lambda, \alpha$ and $\beta$.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence of the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of enstrophy and energy of solutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and diffusion equations in all dimensions, respectively. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former allows us to obtain, for the first time for such type of scaling limits, convergence in a space of positive smoothness uniformly in time. Compared to known results, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in the presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Further, we discuss physical interpretations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study positive properties of the quasilinear elliptic equation
  $$-\mathrm{div}\mathcal{A}(x,\nabla u)+V|u|^{p-2}u=0\quad (1&lt;p&lt;\infty)\qquad \mbox{ in } \Omega,$$ where the function $\mathcal{A}(x,\xi)$ is induced by a family of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n\geq 2$) parameterized by points in the domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $V$ belongs to a certain local Morrey space. We first establish two-sided estimates for Bregman distances of $|\xi|^{p}_{s,a}$ ($1&lt;s&lt;\infty$), where $a=(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ and $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}$ are certain functions with positive local lower and upper bounds in $\Omega$. These estimates lead to a Maz'ya-type characterization for Hardy-weights of the corresponding functionals. Then we prove three types of sufficient conditions for the attainment of the Hardy constant in a certain space $\widetilde{W}^{1,p}_{0}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of periodic wave trains in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system against fully nonlocalized perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a nonlinear stability theory has been developed for wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems relying on pure $L^\infty$-estimates. In the absence of localization of perturbations, it exploits diffusive decay caused by smoothing together with spatio-temporal phase modulation. In this paper, we advance this theory beyond the parabolic setting and propose a scheme designed for general dissipative semilinear problems. We present our method in the context of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system. The lack of parabolicity and localization complicates mode filtration in $L^\infty$-spaces using the Floquet-Bloch transform. Instead, we employ the inverse Laplace representation of the semigroup generated by the linearization to uncover high-frequency damping, while leveraging a novel link to the Floquet-Bloch representation for the smoothing low-frequency part. Another challenge arises in controlling regularity in the quasilinear iteration scheme for the modulated perturbation. We address this by extending the method of nonlinear damping estimates to nonlocalized perturbations using uniformly local Sobolev norms.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for Physics Informed Neural Networks in Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations placed on unbounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) in dimension one posed on the unbounded real line. Several previous works have considered the deep neural network approximation of NLS solutions from the numerical and theoretical point of view in the case of bounded domains. In this paper, we introduce a new PINNs method to treat the case of unbounded domains and show rigorous bounds on the associated approximation error in terms of the energy and Strichartz norms, provided a reasonable integration scheme is available. Applications to traveling waves, breathers and solitons, as well as numerical experiments confirming the validity of the approximation are also presented as well.</description>

      <title>Blowup for the defocusing septic complex-valued nonlinear wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^{4+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove blowup for the defocusing septic complex-valued nonlinear wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^{4+1}$. This work builds on the earlier results of Shao, Wei, and Zhang [SWZ2024a,SWZ2024b], reducing the order of the nonlinearity from $29$ to $7$ in $\mathbb{R}^{4+1}$. As in [SWZ2024a,SWZ2024b], the proof hinges on a connection between solutions to the nonlinear wave equation and the relativistic Euler equations via a front compression blowup mechanism. More specifically, the problem is reduced to constructing smooth, radially symmetric, self-similar imploding profiles for the relativistic Euler equations.
  As with implosion for the compressible Euler equations, the relativistic analogue admits a countable family of smooth imploding profiles. The result in [SWZ2024a] represents the construction of the first profile in this family. In this paper, we construct a sequence of solutions corresponding to the higher-order profiles in the family. This allows us to saturate the inequalities necessary to show blowup for the defocusing complex-valued nonlinear wave equation with an integer order of nonlinearity and radial symmetry via this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Global strong solution for the stochastic tamed Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising from the biomathematics, which consists of a chemotaxis model with cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by virtue of the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators and cut-off functions, which makes it possible for constructing sufficiently smooth approximation solutions, and facilitating the effective use of stochastic entropy-energy estimates. Then, building on the entropy-energy estimates, we further derive some higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method permits us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>

      <title>Blow-up analysis of Large conformal metrics with prescribed Gaussian and geodesic curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a compact Riemannian surface $(M,g)$ with nonempty boundary and negative Euler characteristic. Given two smooth non-constant functions $f$ in $M$ and $h$ in $\partial M$ with $\max f= \max h= 0$, under a suitable condition on the maximum points of $f$ and $h$, we prove that for sufficiently small positive constants $\lambda$ and $\mu$, there exist at least two distinct conformal metrics $g_{\lambda,\mu}=e^{2u_{\mu,\lambda}}g$ and $g^{\lambda,\mu}=e^{2u^{\mu,\lambda}}g$ with prescribed sign-changing Gaussian and geodesic curvature equal to $f + \mu$ and $h + \lambda,$ respectively. Additionally, we employ the method used in Borer et al. (2015) to study the blowing up behavior of the large solution $u^{\mu,\lambda}$ when $\mu\downarrow 0$ and $\lambda\downarrow 0$. Finally, we derive a new Liouville-type result for the half-space, eliminating one of the potential blow-up profiles.</description>

      <title>Fourier Galerkin approximation of mean field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to provide a finite dimensional approximation of the solution to a mean field optimal control problem set on the $d$-dimensional torus. The approximation is obtained by means of a Fourier-Galerkin method, the main principle of which is to convolve probability measures on the torus by the Dirichlet kernel or, equivalently, to truncate the Fourier expansion of probability measures on the torus. However, this operation has the main feature not to leave the space of probability measures invariant, which drawback is know as \textit{Gibbs}' phenomenon. In spite of this, we manage to prove that, for initial conditions in the `interior' of the space of probability measures and for sufficiently large levels of truncation, the Fourier-Galerkin method induces a new finite dimensional control problem whose trajectories take values in the space of probability measures with a finite number of Fourier coefficients. Our main result asserts that, whenever the cost functionals are smooth and convex, the distance between the optimal trajectories of the original and approximating control problems decreases at a polynomial rate as the index of truncation in the Fourier-Galerkin method tends to $\infty$. A similar result holds for the distance between the corresponding value functions. From a practical point of view, our approach provides an efficient strategy to approximate mean field control optimizers by finite dimensional parameters and opens new perspectives for the numerical analysis of mean field control problems. It may be also applied to discretize more general mean field game systems.</description>
