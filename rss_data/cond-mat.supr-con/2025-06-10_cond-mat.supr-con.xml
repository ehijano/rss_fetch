      <title>Intertwined nematic and d-wave superconductive orders in optimally-doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropy of the superconducting state and superconducting fluctuations in the CuO2 plane is directly related to the superconducting mechanism of copper oxide superconductors and is therefore pivotal for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we integrated the high-precision angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) measurement with a rotatable in-plane magnetic field to systematically study the angular dependence of superconducting fluctuations in optimally doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 (LSCO). By independently controlling the directions of the current and the magnetic field, we are able to isolate the magneto-resistivity contributed by the superconducting vortex motion and distinguish excitations from nematic superconductivity and d-wave superconductive order based on their respective C2 and C4 symmetries. Signatures of two intertwined superconductive orders are also evident in the measured angular dependence of the critical current. A T-B phase diagram of different types of superconducting fluctuations is determined. These findings are closely related to other intriguing phenomena, such as pair density wave and charge density wave.</description>

      <title>Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.</description>

      <title>Gor'kov-Hedin Equations for Quantum Many-Body Systems with Spin-Dependent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07302v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the need to understand and determine the presence of non-trivial superconductivity in real candidate materials, we present a generalized set of self-consistent Gor'kov-Hedin equations in a vibrating lattice with spin dependent electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. This extends Hedin's original equations to treat quantum many-body systems where electronic and lattice correlations along with relativistic effects coexist on the same footing. Upon iterating this set of equations, the corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation and generalized ladder approximations are constructed.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Magnon Gauge Interactions in Condensed Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss three different but closely related theories which could describe varieties of condensed matters, in particular the frustrated magnetic materials and the multi-gap (ferro)magnetic superconductors with or without the photon-magnon mixing, where the genuine non-Abelian magnon gauge interaction plays the central role. The charactristic features of these theories are the existence of long range magnetic order and the spin-spin interaction described by the exchange of the messenger bosons, not by the instantaneous action at a distance. These theories could play important roles in our understanding of non-Abelian condensed matters and make the non-Abelian gauge interaction a main stream in the low energy physics. We discuss the physical implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Dual-mode superconducting diode effect enabled by in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has been cherished as a milestone in developing superconducting electronics. Tremendous efforts are being dedicated to realizing SDE in a wide variety of material platforms. Despite the diversity in the hosting materials and device designs, SDE is usually operated in a single mode which is enabled by either out-of-plane or in-plane magnetic field/magnetization. In this work, we report the realization of a dual-mode SDE in 2H-$\mathrm{NbS_2}$/2H-$\mathrm{NbSe_2}$ heterostructures where both the out-of-plane magnetic field $B_{\perp}$ and in-plane magnetic field $B_{||}$ can independently generate and manipulate SDE. The two modes share similar diode efficiency but differ in two aspects: 1. $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE is activated by a field on the order of 1 mT while $B_{||}$-induced SDE requires a field on the order of 100 mT; 2. $\eta$ of $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE exhibits a square-root like temperature dependence while $\eta$ of $B_{||}$-induced SDE takes a more linear-like one. We demonstrate that the dual-mode SDE is most likely a result of mirror symmetry breaking along multiple orientations. Thanks to the two orders difference in the operational field for the two modes, we propose a dual-functionality device scheme to showcase the potential of the dual-mode SDE in realizing advanced superconducting architecture, where fast polarity-switching functionality is implemented with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE and high-fidelity functionality is enabled with $B_{\perp}$-induced SDE.</description>

      <title>What holes in superconductors reveal about superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a type I superconducting body that contains one or more holes in its interior that undergoes a transition between normal and superconducting states in the presence of a magnetic field. We argue that unlike other thermodynamic systems that undergo first order phase transitions the system cannot reach its equilibrium thermodynamic state, and that this sheds new light on the physics of the Meissner effect. How the Meissner effect occurs has not been addressed within the conventional theory of superconductivity, BCS. The situation considered in this paper indicates that expulsion of magnetic field requires physical elements absent from Hamiltonians assumed to describe superconductors within BCS theory. These physical elements are essential components of the alternative theory of hole superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological theory describing the interaction of superconducting condensate with a Bessel beam of twisted light characterized by a nonzero angular momentum $m$. Starting from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model with the complex relaxation time we calculate the spatial profiles of dc photoinduced currents and magnetic fields as well as the second harmonic response. The photocurrents and magnetic fileds are shown to be determined both by the helicity of light and its orbital momentum $m$. Analyzing the half-space and thin film geometries we discuss possible experimental tests aimed to probe the superconducting photocurrents and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-Controlled Superconductivity in Rock-Salt Carbides: Towards Predictive Modelling of Real-World Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically reexamine the superconducting properties of rock-salt transition-metal carbides (TMCs), often regarded as textbook conventional superconductors, combining first-principles electron-phonon calculations with variable-composition evolutionary structure prediction. Studying superconducting trends across the entire transition-metal series, we find that, when the rock-salt stoichiometric phase is dynamically or thermodynamically unstable, carbon-vacant structures identified through unbiased structure prediction permit to reconcile theoretical calculations with experimental trends. Our integrated use of structure prediction and electron-phonon calculations defines a general framework for realistic modelling of superconductors shaped by non-equilibrium synthesis routes and defect tolerance.</description>

      <title>Supermodulation-driven evolution of the nodal structure of bismuth-based cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown novel properties of twisted cuprates. In this paper, I point out that related phenomena occur intrinsically in bismuth-based cuprate superconductors due to the presence of the BiO supermodulation. As the ratio of the supermodulation potential to the superconducting energy gap increases, two critical points are found where semi-Dirac nodes form (that is, that have quadratic dispersion in one direction and liner dispersion in the orthogonal direction). The first critical point should be realized in Bi2212, the second in Bi2201. Implications of these findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Pairing in Bilayer Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of $T_c\sim 80$~K superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has launched a new platform to study high-temperature superconductivity. Using non-perturbative dynamic cluster approximation quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we characterize the magnetic and superconducting pairing behavior of a realistic bilayer two-orbital Hubbard-Hund model of this system that describes the relevant Ni $e_g$ states with physically relevant interaction strengths. We find a leading $s^\pm$ superconducting instability in this model and show that this state primarily arises from interlayer pairing in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital that is driven by strong interlayer spin-fluctuations in that orbital. These results provide non-perturbative evidence supporting the picture that a simple single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model for the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital provides an excellent low-energy effective description of the superconducting behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. III: Einstein phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersionless limit of the standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by Einstein phonons of frequency $\Omega&gt;0$, equipped with electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$. This allows for a detailed evaluation of the general results on $T_c$ for phonons with non-trivial dispersion relation, obtained in a previous paper, (II), by the authors. The variational principle for the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal state region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, obtained in (II), simplifies as follows: If $(\lambda,\Omega,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$, where $\varpi:=\Omega/2\pi T$, and where $\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences; $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ is the dispersionless limit $P(d\omega)\to\delta(\omega-\Omega)d\omega$ of the operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ of (II). It is shown that when $\varpi \leq \sqrt{2}$, then the map $\varpi\mapsto\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$ is invertible. For $\lambda&gt;0.77$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) = \Omega f(\lambda)$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $f(\lambda)$ that converges to $f(\lambda)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,\Omega)$, which agrees with the asymptotic behavior $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) \sim C \Omega\sqrt{\lambda}$ for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $\Omega$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$, where $C_\infty := \frac{1}{2\pi}\mathfrak{k}(2)^\frac12 =0.1827262477...$ is the optimal constant, and $\mathfrak{k}(\gamma)&gt;0$ the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator for the $\gamma$ model, determined in the first paper, (I), on $T_c$ by the authors.</description>

      <title>Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with critical temperature $T_c$ higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase multilayer nickelates. Very recently, SC is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ substrate with $T_c$ above the McMillan limit ($\approx 40\text{ K}$) at ambient pressure (AP), allowing various experimental investigation on the pairing mechanism in this material. It is now eager to enhance the $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Here we propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance the $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. The physics underlying this proposal is clear and simple. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under the mean-field treatment and the density matrix renormalization group approach consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to realize HTSC with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of $p$-wave magnetism and superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open an avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761</link>

Abstract: Although no known material exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, wherein spin-triplet odd-parity electron pairing occurs, UTe2 is now the leading representative of this class. Conventionally, the parity of the superconducting order parameter may be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) at energies within the maximum superconducting energy gap. QPI would then be dominated by the electronic structure of the QSB and only reveal the characteristics of the bulk order parameter excursively. Here, we visualize quasiparticle interference patterns of UTe2 and find that, at the (0-11) cleave surface, a new band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears only in the superconducting state. QPI visualization then allows study of dispersion of states within this QSB, which we demonstrate exists only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) surface. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to predict the QPI signatures of such a QSB at the (0-11) surface of UTe2. Its predictions are most consistent with the experimental results if the bulk superconducting gap function exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator (SI) to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. II: Dispersive phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied, in which the effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by generally dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega&gt;0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega =: \lambda P(d\omega)$, formally defining a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ with compact support, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences constructed in the paper. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with a constant $C$ that is a factor $\approx 2.034$ larger than the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. I: The $\gamma$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the recent reformulation for the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in terms of a classical interacting Bloch spin chain model, rigorous upper and lower bounds on the critical temperature $T_c$ are obtained for the $\gamma$ model -- a version of Eliashberg theory in which the effective electron-electron interaction is proportional to $(g/|\omega_n-\omega_m|)^{\gamma}$, where $\omega_n-\omega_m$ is the transferred Matsubara frequency, $g&gt;0$ a reference energy, and $\gamma&gt;0$ a parameter. The rigorous lower bounds are based on a variational principle that identifies $(T_c/g)^\gamma$ with the largest (positive) eigenvalue of an explicitly constructed compact, self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{G}(\gamma)$. These lower bounds form an increasing sequence that converges to $T_c(g,\gamma)$. The upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$ is based on fixed point theory, proving linear stability of the normal state for $T$ larger than the upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.</description>
