      <title>Double-flattop quantum droplets in low-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of double-flattop quantum droplets in atomic Bose-Bose mixtures. Solutions of this type have two flattop regions of nearly uniform atomic density corresponding to a compressed central core surrounded by a rarefied layer. The birth of these double-flattop quantum droplets is analytically described using a perturbation theory, which in the leading order reduces the problem to the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Its properties are then used to predict the shape of double-flattop solutions and draw the conclusions about their stability. The analytical results apply to one- and multidimensional quantum droplets, provided that the energy density satisfies certain conditions. Using the numerical continuation from the asymptotic limit, we obtain the families of one- and two-dimensional double flattop quantum droplets and confirm the stability of the nodeless states of this type.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gas Microscopy of Fermions in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopically probing quantum many-body systems by resolving their constituent particles is essential for understanding quantum matter. In most physical systems, distinguishing individual particles, such as electrons in solids, or neutrons and quarks in neutron stars, is impossible. Atom-based quantum simulators offer a unique platform that enables the imaging of each particle in a many-body system. Until now, however, this capability has been limited to quantum systems in discretized space such as optical lattices and tweezers, where spatial degrees of freedom are quantized. Here, we introduce a novel method for imaging atomic quantum many-body systems in the continuum, allowing for in situ resolution of every particle. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on a two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas. We probe the density correlation functions, resolving their full spatial functional form, and reveal the shape of the Fermi hole arising from Pauli exclusion as a function of temperature. Our method opens the door to probing strongly-correlated quantum gases in the continuum with unprecedented spatial resolution, providing in situ access to spatially resolved correlation functions of arbitrarily high order across the entire system.</description>

      <title>In situ imaging of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first in situ observation of density fluctuations on the scale of the thermal de Broglie wavelength in an ultracold gas of bosons. Bunching of $^{87}$Rb atoms in a quasi two-dimensional system is observed by single-atom imaging using a quantum gas microscope. Compared to a classical ensemble, we observe a 30 percent enhancement of the second-order correlation function. We show the spatial and thermal dependence of these correlations. The reported method of detecting in situ correlations can be applied to interacting many-body systems and to the study of critical phenomena near phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field suppression of tomographic electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wavenumbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for performing a Bell test using momentum-entangled pairs of atoms with different masses. This proposal uses the metastable isotopes of helium 3He* and 4He* for their single-atom detection capabilities, though the approach could be generalised to other atoms. The entangled state is generated by colliding these species and manipulated via two independent atom interferometers. This method enables precise control of the relative phases of each species, overcoming previous challenges in single-species atomic momentum Bell tests. Numerical simulations of the process show that it should be possible to achieve a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic experimental conditions and within a quantum mechanics framework. This type of superposition is interesting from a general relativity perspective as it introduces ambiguity in determining spacetime curvature of the quantum state. Such experiments are necessary to better understand the intersection between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in a constrained two-qubit quantum control landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimal quantum control, control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) indicate sharp changes occurring in the set of optimal protocols, as a physical model parameter is varied. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a new class of CLPTs, associated with changes in the topological properties of the optimal level set in a two-qubit state-preparation problem. In particular, the distance distribution of control protocols sampled through stochastic homotopic dynamics reveals discontinuous changes in the number of connected components in the optimal level set, as a function of the protocol duration. We demonstrate how topological CLPTs can be detected in modern-day experiments.</description>

      <title>Vortex lattice states of bilayer electron-hole fluids in quantizing magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translational symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density and weakening magnetic fields drive vortex delocalization transitions signaled experimentally by abrupt increases in counterflow transport resistance.</description>

      <title>Double-target BEC atomtronic rotation sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-concept design for an atomtronic rotation sensor consisting of an array of ``double-target'' Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). A ``target'' BEC is a disk-shaped condensate surrounded by a concentric ring-shaped condensate. A ``double-target'' BEC is two adjacent target BECs whose ring condensates partially overlap. The sensor consists of an $n\times m$ array of these double-target BECs. The measurement of the frame rotation speed, $\Omega_{R}$, is carried out by creating the array of double-target BECs (setup step), inducing one unit of quantized flow in the top ring of each member of the array (initialization step), applying potential barriers in the overlap region of each member (measurement step), and observing whether the induced flow is transferred from the top to the bottom ring in each member (readout step). We describe a set of simulations showing that a single instance of a double-target BEC behaves in a way that enables the efficient operation of an $n\times m$ array for measuring $\Omega_{R}$. As an example of sensor operation we present a simulation showing that a 2$\times$2 array can be designed to measure $\Omega_{R}$ in a user-specified range.</description>

      <title>Open quantum dynamics with variational non-Gaussian states and the truncated Wigner approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for simulating the open dynamics of spin-boson systems by combining variational non-Gaussian states with a quantum trajectories approach. We apply this method to a generic spin-boson Hamiltonian that has both Tavis-Cummings and Holstein type couplings, and which has broad applications to a variety of quantum simulation platforms, polaritonic physics, and quantum chemistry. Additionally, we discuss how the recently developed truncated Wigner approximation for open quantum systems can be applied to the same Hamiltonian. We benchmark the performance of both methods and identify the regimes where each method is best suited to. Finally we discuss strategies to improve each technique.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Enriched Nontrivial Topology at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have attracted growing attention due to the emergence of intriguing phenomena that are absent in equilibrium physics. In this letter, we identify a new class of Floquet criticality characterized by nontrivial topology. For generic driven Majorana fermion chains with chiral symmetry, we analytically demonstrate that Floquet driving can enrich the transition point, resulting in topologically distinct quantum critical lines that are absent in undriven systems. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical explanation for the underlying mechanism of the nontrivial topology at Floquet criticality and generalize our results to higher dimensions. This work not only extends the scope of topological physics in Floquet systems but also deepens our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>
