      <title>Unweighted Layered Graph Traversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1989, layered graph traversal is an important problem in online algorithms and mobile computing that has been studied for several decades, and which now is essentially resolved in its original formulation. In this paper, we demonstrate that what appears to be an innocuous modification of the problem actually leads to a drastic (exponential) reduction of the competitive ratio. Specifically, we present an algorithm that is $O(\log^2 w)$-competitive for traversing unweighted layered graphs of width $w$. Our technique is based on a simple entropic regularizer, which evolves as the agent progresses in the layered graph. Our algorithm is randomized and simply maintains that at all layers, the probability distribution of the position of the mobile agent maximizes the entropic regularizer.</description>

      <title>The tangent space in sub-Finsler geometry and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tangent space to a sub-Finsler manifold in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We prove that the metric tangent is described by the nilpotent approximation, generalizing the sub-Riemannian result. Additionally, we study the blow-up of a measure on a sub-Finsler manifold. We identify the new notion of bounded measure which ensures that, in the limit, the blow-up is a scalar multiple of the Lebesgue measure. Our results have applications in the study of the Lott-Sturm-Villani curvature-dimension condition in sub-Finsler manifolds. In particular, we show the failure of the CD condition in equiregular sub-Finsler manifolds with growth vector (2,3), equipped with a bounded measure.</description>

      <title>The Andoni-Naor-Neiman inequalities and isometric embeddability into a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andoni, Naor and Neiman (2018) established a family of quadratic metric inequalities that hold true in every $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. As stated in their paper, this family seems to include all previously used quadratic metric inequalities that hold true in every $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. We prove that there exists a metric space that satisfies all inequalities in this family but does not admit an isometric embedding into any $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. More precisely, we prove that the $6$-point metric spaces constructed by Nina Lebedeva, which are known to admit no isometric embedding into any $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space, satisfy all inequalities in this family.</description>

      <title>Generalized Morse Theory for Tubular Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04034v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of Morse function and establish Morse theory-like theorems over offsets of any compact set in a Euclidean space at regular values of their distance function. Using non-smooth analysis and tools from geometric measure theory, we prove that the homotopy type of the sublevels sets of these Morse functions changes at a critical value by gluing exactly one cell around each critical point.</description>
