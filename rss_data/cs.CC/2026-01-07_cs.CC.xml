      <title>$\mathsf{QAC}^0$ Contains $\mathsf{TC}^0$ (with Many Copies of the Input)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ is the class of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits constructed from arbitrary single-qubit gates and generalized Toffoli gates. It is arguably the smallest natural class of constant-depth quantum computation which has not been shown useful for computing any non-trivial Boolean function. Despite this, many attempts to port classical $\mathsf{AC}^0$ lower bounds to $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ have failed.
  We give one possible explanation of this: $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits are significantly more powerful than their classical counterparts. We show the unconditional separation $\mathsf{QAC}^0\not\subset\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$ for decision problems, which also resolves for the first time whether $\mathsf{AC}^0$ could be more powerful than $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Moreover, we prove that $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits can compute a wide range of Boolean functions if given multiple copies of the input: $\mathsf{TC}^0 \subseteq \mathsf{QAC}^0 \circ \mathsf{NC}^0$. Along the way, we introduce an amplitude amplification technique that makes several approximate constant-depth constructions exact.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Regular Expression Matching with Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regular expression matching problem asks whether a given regular expression of length $m$ matches a given string of length $n$. As is well known, the problem can be solved in $O(nm)$ time using Thompson's algorithm. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the matching problem for regular expressions extended with a practical extension called lookaround can be solved in the same time complexity. In this work, we consider three well-known extensions to regular expressions called backreference, intersection and complement, and we show that, unlike in the case of lookaround, the matching problem for regular expressions extended with any of the three (for backreference, even when restricted to one capturing group) cannot be solved in $O(n^{2-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Moreover, we study the matching problem for regular expressions extended with complement in more detail, which is also known as extended regular expression (ERE) matching. We show that there is no ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{\omega-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time ($2 \le \omega &lt; 2.3716$ is the exponent of square matrix multiplication) for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis, and there is no combinatorial ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{3-\varepsilon} \mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under the Combinatorial $k$-Clique Hypothesis. This shows that the $O(n^3 m)$-time algorithm introduced by Hopcroft and Ullman in 1979 and recently improved by Bille et al. to run in $O(n^\omega m)$ time using fast matrix multiplication was already optimal in a sense, and sheds light on why the theoretical computer science community has struggled to improve the time complexity of ERE matching with respect to $n$ and $m$ for more than 45 years.</description>

      <title>On the Intrinsic Limits of Transformer Image Embeddings in Non-Solvable Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.</description>
