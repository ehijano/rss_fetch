      <description>arXiv:2503.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present calculations of neutron thermal cross sections, Westcott factors, resonance integrals, Maxwellian-averaged cross sections, astrophysical reaction rates, and solar system $r$-process abundances using the latest data from the major evaluated nuclear libraries for 849 ENDF target materials. The recent release of ENDF/B-VIII.1 library, progress in $^{252}$Cf(SF) evaluation, extensive analysis of newly-evaluated neutron reaction cross sections, neutron covariances, and improvements in data processing techniques motivated us to calculate the nuclear industry and neutron physics parameters, produce $s$-process Maxwellian-averaged cross sections and astrophysical reaction rates, extract $r$-process abundances, systematically calculate uncertainties, and provide additional insights on currently available neutron-induced reaction data.</description>

      <title>Spherical and Deformed Shell Effect Competition in Quasifission of Superheavy Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasifission, along with fusion-fission, represent the two most likely reaction outcomes to occur post-capture in collisions leading to superheavy nuclei. As such, understanding these mechanisms and how they relate to one another is key to understanding the intricate dynamics that drive the formation (or dissociation) of the nascent compound nuclei formed in fusion reactions. This understanding directly translates to a more informed picture of suitable reaction partners and can provide vital information for experimental efforts to study the physics and chemistry of superheavy elements. In this work we report results from time-dependent simulations of $^{48}$Ca + $^{238}$U and $^{50}$Ti + $^{236}$Th reactions at incident energies just above the Coulomb barrier with a focus on the quasifission process that prevent the formation of a fully equilibrated $^{286}$Cn compound nucleus. We study these reactions systematically and consider a wide range of initial configurations to extract a robust estimate of primary fragment yields for the quasifission process. Multiple preferred exit channels are observed, with both spherical and deformed shell effects in the heavy and light fragments driving contributions to the production yields depending on the initial configuration of the system. Orientation effects of the deformed actinide targets are found to be a primary driver of which exit channels are populated. Furthermore, the impact of moving away from a doubly-magic projectile is explored with implications towards the reactions considered for current and future superheavy searches.</description>

      <title>Deep learning approaches for nuclear binding energy prediction: a comparative study of RNN, GRU and LSTM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of deep learning models-recurrent neural networks, gated recurrent units, and long short-term memory networks-for predicting nuclear binding energies. Utilizing data from the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020), we incorporate key nuclear structure features, including proton and neutron numbers, as well as additional terms from the liquid drop model and shell effects. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that the gated recurrent units model achieves the lowest root-mean-square error ({\sigma}RMSE) of 0.326 MeV, surpassing traditional regression-based approaches. To assess model reliability, we validate predictions using the GarveyKelson relations, obtaining an error of 0.202 MeV, and further test extrapolation capabilities using the WS, WS3, and WS4 models. The extrapolation analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, particularly in predicting binding energies for nuclei near the driplines. These results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in nuclear BE predictions, highlighting its potential to enhance the accuracy and reliability of theoretical nuclear models.</description>

      <title>I-C-Q relations for rapidly rotating stable hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of hadronic equations of state for neutron stars have been investigated for the purpose of the present paper, considering the fact that at sufficiently high density, heavy baryons and quark phases may appear. The observational limits from NICER, GW170817, etc., are obeyed by our choice of equations of state. The universal relations are investigated for both slowly and rapidly rotating neutron stars with heavy baryons present inside the core. For slowly rotating stars, the universality of the I-Love-Q relations is verified, and the I-C-Q relations are inferred to be universal for rapidly rotating stars. Further, we extend the investigation to obtain the universal relations for compact stars containing the quark core, where the connected stable branch of such hybrid stars is considered. The parameters of the I-Love-Q and I-C-Q universal relations are obtained for slowly rotating and rapidly rotating hybrid stars, respectively. These relations would enable extracting information, within the context of general relativity, from astrophysical systems involving rapidly rotating neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Quantum molecular dynamics model based on relativistic mean field theory for light nucleus fragmentation in hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the accuracy of nuclear fragmentation simulations using a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model based on relativistic mean field (RMF) theory for an energy range of 50-400 MeV/u, relevant to hadron therapy. A total of 16 parameter sets within the RMF framework are assessed based on their ability to reproduce ground-state properties such as the mean squared radius and binding energy, as obtained in QMD simulations. Among these, the NS2 parameter set is identified as the most suitable for describing stable nuclei over a wide mass range, with the use of an adaptive Gaussian wave packet width. Fragmentation cross sections of carbon ion projectiles on light nuclei targets (H, C, O, Al, Ti, and Cu) are simulated at incident energies of 50, 95, 290, and 400 MeV/u and compared with experimental data. The results indicate that the RQMD.RMF model provides superior reproductions for fragmentation at lower energies (50 and 95 MeV/u) compared to the Light Ion QMD (LIQMD) model implemented in Geant4 version 11.2. At higher energies (290 and 400 MeV/u), the RQMD.RMF model performs comparably to the LIQMD. This study demonstrates that the RQMD.RMF model provides a reliable framework for analyzing nuclear fragmentation and holds potential for applications in the planning and quality assurance of hadron therapy.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review of 2$\beta$ Decay Half-Lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double-beta (2$\beta$)-decay is the rarest nuclear physics process, and its experimental half-lives (T$_{1/2}$) exceed the age of the Universe from nine to fourteen orders of magnitude. Double-beta decay was observed, and its half-life was measured in 14 parent nuclei using direct, radiochemical, and geochemical methods. The decay observables are analyzed using the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) procedures, and the recommended T$_{1/2}$ were deduced. Using the calculated values of phase factors, the effective nuclear matrix elements were extracted and compared with available data. Thousands of theoretical and experimental works have been dedicated to these topics in the last 85 years, and we present two data sets of recommended values to encapsulate the results.</description>

      <title>Quark antenna in early stage anisotropic QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The states of matter produced in the early stage of heavy ion collisions can be highly anisotropic. If such a feature is sufficiently pronounced, one should expect the final particle distribution inside jets to reflect it in the form of non-trivial angle correlations. In this talk, we discuss a first step in exploring such correlations by studying how a $q\bar q$ state produced from an initial unpolarized gluon couples to the anisotropies of an underlying static QCD medium. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching parameter to take different magnitudes in two orthogonal directions in the plane transverse to the jet axis. We find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy in the form of an azimuthal angle modulation, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states, offering a novel way to extract the details of the underlying matter which is not accessible with standard jet observables. We further show how such features can be extracted from the Fourier decomposition of the distribution and from final state transverse spin polarization measurements.</description>

      <title>Atomic determination of the nuclear quadrupole moment $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}{\rm Bi})$ using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method implemented in the Grasp2018 package was employed to calculate the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction constants and electric field gradients of levels in the ground configuration of the neutral bismuth atom. Combining the calculated electric field gradient of the ground state with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction constant, we extracted the nuclear quadrupole moment for the $^{209}$Bi isotope, $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}\textbf{Bi}) = -422(22)$~mb. This value, together with other results obtained from atomic- and molecular-structure calculations, created the ``world average" nuclear quadrupole moment of this isotope, $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}\textbf{Bi}) = -420(17)$~mb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring Efimov states in $D^*D^*D^*$ and $DD^*D^*$ three-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Efimov effect is an intriguing three-body quantum phenomenon. Searching for Efimov states within the realms of nuclear and hadronic physics presents a challenge due to the inherent inability of natural physical systems to exhibit adjustable two-body scattering lengths. In this study, we examine the potential existence of Efimov states in the $D^*D^*D^*$ and $DD^*D^*$ three-hadron systems. Utilizing a pionless effective field theory framework, we determine that the presence of Efimov states in the spectrum of the $D^*D^*D^*$ system is contingent upon the existence of an $(I,J)=(1,2)$ $D^*D^*$ two-body bound system. If only the $T_{cc}^+$ and its heavy quark spin partner $T_{cc}^{*+}$ exist while there is no near-threshold pole in all other $S$-wave $D^{(*)}D^*$ scattering amplitudes, no Efimov effect is expected in the $D^{(*)}D^*D^*$ systems.</description>

      <title>The role of chiral symmetry and the non-ordinary $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ nature in $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the use of realistic $\pi K$ interactions, obtained from a dispersive analysis of scattering data, as well as relativistic corrections, are essential to describe recently observed $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations. We demonstrate that the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking dynamics and the non-ordinary features of the $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ resonance, together with large cancellations between isospin channels, produce a large suppression of $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations compared to widely used models. Within an improved version of the standard on-shell factorization formalism, we illustrate that compensating for this interaction suppression leads to source radii smaller than 1 fm, contrary to usual expectations, as well as larger correlation strengths. The relation between these two parameters cannot be accommodated within naive models describing the nature of the resonances. This may raise concerns about the applicability of popular but too simple approaches for systems with light mesons. However, the correlation-suppression effects we demonstrate here will be relevant in any formalism, and substantial corrections may be expected for other femtoscopic systems involving light mesons.</description>

      <title>Production of leptons from decay of heavy-flavor hadrons in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study on the production of the heavy-flavour decay lepton (HFL) in high-energy nuclear collisions at the LHC. The pp-baseline is calculated by the FONLL program, which matches the next-to-leading order pQCD calculation with the next-to-leading-log large-$p_T$ resummation. The in-medium propagation of heavy quarks is driven by the modified Langevin equations, which consider both the elastic and inelastic partonic interactions. We propose a method to separate the respective influence of the six factors, such as pp-spectra, the cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, in-medium energy loss (E-loss), fragmentation functions (FFs), coalescence (Coal), and decay channels, which may contribute to the larger $R_{AA}$ of HFL $\leftarrow b$ compared to that of HFL $\leftarrow c$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Based on quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that both coalescence hadronization, decay channels and the mass-dependent E-loss play an essential role at $p_T&lt;5$ GeV, while the latter dominates the higher $p_T$ region. It is also found that the influences of the CNM effects and FFs are insignificant. At the same time, different initial pp-spectra of charm and bottom quarks have a considerable impact at $p_T&gt;5$ GeV. Furthermore, we explore the path-length dependence of jet quenching by comparing the HFL $R_{AA}$ in two different collision systems. Our investigations show smaller HFL $R_{AA}$ in Pb+Pb than in Xe+Xe within the same centrality bin, consistent with the ALICE data. The longer propagation time and more effective energy loss of heavy quarks in Pb+Pb collisions play critical roles in the stronger yield suppression of the HFL compared to that in Xe+Xe. In addition, we observe a scaling behavior of the HFL $R_{AA}$ in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Baryon Resonances with Transition Generalized Parton Distributions: Status and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QCD gives rise to a rich spectrum of excited baryon states. Understanding their internal structure is important for many areas of nuclear physics, such as nuclear forces, dense matter, and neutrino-nucleus interactions. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are an established tool for characterizing the QCD structure of the ground-state nucleon. They are used to create 3D tomographic images of the quark/gluon structure and quantify the mechanical properties such as the distribution of mass, angular momentum and forces in the system. Transition GPDs extend these concepts to $N \rightarrow N^\ast$ transitions and can be used to characterize the 3D structure and mechanical properties of baryon resonances. They can be probed in high-momentum-transfer exclusive electroproduction processes with resonance transitions $e + N \rightarrow e' + M + N^\ast$, such as deeply-virtual Compton scattering ($M = \gamma$) or meson production ($M = \pi, K$, $etc.$), and in related photon/hadron-induced processes. This White Paper describes a research program aiming to explore baryon resonance structure with transition GPDs. This includes the properties and interpretation of the transition GPDs, theoretical methods for structures and processes, first experimental results from JLab 12 GeV, future measurements with existing and planned facilities (JLab detector and energy upgrades, COMPASS/AMBER, EIC, EicC, J-PARC, LHC ultraperihperal collisions), and the theoretical and experimental developments needed to realize this program.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 contribution in the Drell-Yan process with tensor-polarized deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron can be probed through the proton-deuteron Drell-Yan process, where the proton is unpolarized and the deuteron is tensor polarized. This measurement will be conducted at Fermilab in the near future. In this reaction, the twist-3 contribution is not negligible compared to the twist-2 contribution due to the limited invariant mass of the dilepton pair. We calculate the twist-3 contribution for the Drell-Yan cross section with a tensor-polarized deuteron target, preserving the U(1)-gauge invariance of the hadronic tensor. The cross sections and weighted cross sections are expressed in terms of the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs), thus one can extract the PDFs $f_{1\scriptscriptstyle{LL}}$, $f_{\scriptscriptstyle{LT}}$, and $f^{(1)}_{\scriptscriptstyle{1LT}}$ from the experimental measurements of Drell-Yan process. Our study should be helpful to solve the puzzle in the tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness and $\ln{\Lambda}$ for DMSQSs. Further, our studies indicate that the inclusion of DM in compact stars reduces the deviation of $f$-mode frequency from general relativistic to Cowling approximation.</description>

      <title>New Tool to Detect Inhomogeneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we discuss a novel method to search for inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in theories with fermions. The prime application we have in mind is QCD, but the method is also applicable for other theories, including solid-state applications. It is based on an extension of the chiral susceptibility to inhomogeneous phases and it works as a stability analysis. Our method allows us to determine when homogeneous solutions have the tendency to create spatially modulated condensates. As proof of principle, we apply this technique to a rainbow-ladder QCD model and find that its phase diagram contains an inhomogeneous region.</description>
