      <title>A Spectral Framework for Tracking Communities in Evolving Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering and tracking communities in time-varying networks is an important task in network science, motivated by applications in fields ranging from neuroscience to sociology. In this work, we characterize the celebrated family of spectral methods for static clustering in terms of the low-rank approximation of high-dimensional node embeddings. From this perspective, it becomes natural to view the evolving community detection problem as one of subspace tracking on the Grassmann manifold. While the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex, we adopt a block majorize-minimize Riemannian optimization scheme to learn the Grassmann geodesic which best fits the data. Our framework generalizes any static spectral community detection approach and leads to algorithms achieving favorable performance on synthetic and real temporal networks, including those that are weighted, signed, directed, mixed-membership, multiview, hierarchical, cocommunity-structured, bipartite, or some combination thereof. We demonstrate how to specifically cast a wide variety of methods into our framework, and demonstrate greatly improved dynamic community detection results in all cases.</description>

      <title>Non-Progressive Influence Maximization in Dynamic Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence maximization (IM) problem involves identifying a set of key individuals in a social network who can maximize the spread of influence through their network connections. With the advent of geometric deep learning on graphs, great progress has been made towards better solutions for the IM problem. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic non-progressive IM problem, which considers the dynamic nature of real-world social networks and the special case where the influence diffusion is non-progressive, i.e., nodes can be activated multiple times. We first extend an existing diffusion model to capture the non-progressive influence propagation in dynamic social networks. We then propose the method, DNIMRL, which employs deep reinforcement learning and dynamic graph embedding to solve the dynamic non-progressive IM problem. In particular, we propose a novel algorithm that effectively leverages graph embedding to capture the temporal changes of dynamic networks and seamlessly integrates with deep reinforcement learning. The experiments, on different types of real-world social network datasets, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Hypermodularity and community detection in higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous networked systems feature a structure of non-trivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to develop methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still relatively unexplored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Cross-Border Transaction Anomaly Detection in Anti-Money Laundering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of globalization and the rapid expansion of the digital economy, anti-money laundering (AML) has become a crucial aspect of financial oversight, particularly in cross-border transactions. The rising complexity and scale of international financial flows necessitate more intelligent and adaptive AML systems to combat increasingly sophisticated money laundering techniques. This paper explores the application of unsupervised learning models in cross-border AML systems, focusing on rule optimization through contrastive learning techniques. Five deep learning models, ranging from basic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to hybrid CNNGRU architectures, were designed and tested to assess their performance in detecting abnormal transactions. The results demonstrate that as model complexity increases, so does the system's detection accuracy and responsiveness. In particular, the self-developed hybrid Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Integration Model (CRNIM) model showed superior performance in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). These findings highlight the potential of unsupervised learning models to significantly improve the intelligence, flexibility, and real-time capabilities of AML systems. By optimizing detection rules and enhancing adaptability to emerging money laundering schemes, this research provides both theoretical and practical contributions to the advancement of AML technologies, which are essential for safeguarding the global financial system against illicit activities.</description>

      <title>Contextualized Counterspeech: Strategies for Adaptation, Personalization, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse. However, current counterspeech is one-size-fits-all, lacking adaptation to the moderation context and the users involved. We propose and evaluate multiple strategies for generating tailored counterspeech that is adapted to the moderation context and personalized for the moderated user. We instruct an LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Environmental Sensitivity of Individual Gains in Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) is to identify the seed set to maximize information dissemination in a network. Elegant IM algorithms could naturally extend to cases where each node is equipped with a specific weight, reflecting individual gains to measure the node's importance. Prevailing literature typically assumes such individual gains remain constant throughout the cascade process and are solvable through explicit formulas based on the node's characteristics and network topology. However, this assumption is not always feasible for two reasons: 1)Unobservability: The individual gains of each node are primarily evaluated by the difference between the outputs in the activated and non-activated states. In practice, we can only observe one of these states, with the other remaining unobservable post-propagation. 2)Environmental sensitivity: In addition to the node's inherent properties, individual gains are also sensitive to the activation status of surrounding nodes, which is dynamic during iteration even when the network topology remains static. To address these challenges, we extend the consideration of IM to a broader scenario with dynamic node individual gains, leveraging causality techniques. In our paper, we introduce a Causal Influence Maximization (CauIM) framework and develop two algorithms, G-CauIM and A-CauIM, where the latter incorporates a novel acceleration technique. Theoretically, we establish the generalized lower bound of influence spread and provide robustness analysis. Empirically, in synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Simulating Relational Event Histories: Why and How</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important social phenomena are characterized by repeated interactions among individuals over time such as email exchanges in an organization or face-to-face interactions in a classroom. To understand the underlying mechanisms of social interaction dynamics, statistical simulation techniques of longitudinal network data on a fine temporal granularity are crucially important. This paper makes two contributions to the field. First, we present statistical frameworks to simulate relational event networks under dyadic and actor-oriented relational event models which are implemented in a new R package 'remulate'. Second, we explain how the simulation framework can be used to address challenging problems in temporal social network analysis, such as model fit assessment, theory building, network intervention planning, making predictions, understanding the impact of network structures, to name a few. This is shown in three extensive case studies. In the first study, it is elaborated why simulation-based techniques are crucial for relational event model assessment which is illustrated for a network of criminal gangs. In the second study, it is shown how simulation techniques are important when building and extending theories about social phenomena which is illustrated via optimal distinctiveness theory. In the third study, we demonstrate how simulation techniques contribute to a better understanding of the longevity and the potential effect sizes of network interventions. Through these case studies and software, researchers will be able to better understand social interaction dynamics using relational event data from real-life networks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Social Tie Strength: Definitions, Prediction Methods, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of online social networks has underscored the importance of understanding the intensity of user relationships, referred to as "tie strength." Over the past few decades, extensive efforts have been made to assess tie strength in networks. However, the lack of ground-truth tie strength labels and the differing perspectives on tie strength among researchers have complicated the development of effective prediction methods for real-world applications. In our study, we first categorize mainstream understandings of tie strength into seven standardized definitions and verify their effectiveness by investigating the class distributions and correlations across these definitions. We also draw key insights into tie resilience from the perspective of tie dissolution that (1) stronger ties are more resilient than weaker ones, and (2) this tie resiliency ratio increases as the network evolves. We then conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing tie strength prediction methods under these definitions, revealing that (1) neural network methods capable of learning from semantic features hold great potential for high performance, (2) models struggle under definitions that offer limited understandings of tie strength in the network, (3) existing models face imbalance issues that cannot be addressed by traditional quantity imbalance techniques, and (4) different definitions of tie strength allow for the inference of not only the current state but also the future state of a tie. Building on these findings, we propose strategies to improve existing methods and suggest several promising directions for future research.

      <title>Top-r Influential Community Search in Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community search over bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem, and finding influential communities has attracted significant attention. However, all existing studies have used the minimum weight of vertices as the influence of communities. This leads to an inaccurate assessment of real influence in graphs where there are only a few vertices with low weights. In this paper, we propose a new cohesive subgraph model named ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-influential community that considers the average weight of vertices from two layers on bipartite graphs, thereby providing a more comprehensive reflection of community influence. Based on this community model, we present a recursive algorithm that traverses the entire bipartite graph to find top-$r$ ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-influential communities. To further expedite the search for influential communities, we propose a slim tree structure to reduce the search width and introduce several effective upper bounds to reduce the search depth. Since we have proven that this problem is NP-hard, using exact algorithms to find top-$r$ ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-communities accurately is very time-consuming. Therefore, we propose an approximate algorithm using a greedy approach to find top-$r$ ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-communities as quickly as possible. It only takes $O((n+m)+m\log_{}{n})$ time. Additionally, we introduce a new pruning algorithm to improve the efficiency of the search. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world graphs validate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Model of Bipartite Networks: Application to Cosponsorship in the United States Senate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networks in political and social research are bipartite, with edges connecting exclusively across two distinct types of nodes. A common example includes cosponsorship networks, in which legislators are connected indirectly through the bills they support. Yet most existing network models are designed for unipartite networks, where edges can arise between any pair of nodes. However, using a unipartite network model to analyze bipartite networks, as often done in practice, can result in aggregation bias and artificially high-clustering -- a particularly insidious problem when studying the role groups play in network formation. To address these methodological problems, we develop a statistical model of bipartite networks theorized to be generated through group interactions by extending the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel. Our model allows researchers to identify the groups of nodes, within each node type in the bipartite structure, that share common patterns of edge formation. The model also incorporates both node and dyad-level covariates as the predictors of group membership and of observed dyadic relations. We develop an efficient computational algorithm for fitting the model, and apply it to cosponsorship data from the United States Senate. We show that legislators in a Senate that was perfectly split along party lines were able to remain productive and pass major legislation by forming non-partisan, power-brokering coalitions that found common ground through their collaboration on low-stakes bills. We also find evidence for norms of reciprocity, and uncover the substantial role played by policy expertise in the formation of cosponsorships between senators and legislation. We make an open-source software package available that makes it possible for other researchers to uncover similar insights from bipartite networks.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>
