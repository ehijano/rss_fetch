      <title>Weak decays in superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superheavy nuclei represent the heaviest atoms and nuclides known at the limit of mass and charge. The observed superheavy nuclei are all proton-rich; they decay primarily by emitting $\alpha$ particles and fission, with a possible small electron capture (EC) branch. Due to the huge atomic numbers and associated relativistic effects, EC-decays of superheavy systems are expected to differ from what is known in lighter nuclei. In this paper, using the quantified relativistic nuclear density functional theory and the quasiparticle random-phase approximation with the interaction optimized to experimental $\beta^-$-decay half-lives and Gamow-Teller resonance energies, we study the EC/$\beta^\pm$-decays in $Z = 101-118$ nuclei. Both allowed ($1^+$) and first-forbidden ($0^-, 1^-$ and $2^-$) transitions are considered. We show that the first-forbidden $1^-$ transitions dominate the decay rates in almost all studied nuclei. For proton-rich nuclei, EC dominates over $\beta^+$ decay. We identify 44 nuclei with EC/$\beta^+$ branching ratio larger than 5\%, indicating a possible competition with $\alpha$-decay and spontaneous fission channels.</description>

      <title>Effect of vector meson spin coherence on the measurements of chiral magnetic effect in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions reflects the local violation of ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal CP}$ symmetries in strong interactions and manifests as electric charge separation along the direction of the magnetic field created by the wounded nuclei. The experimental observables for the CME, such as the $\gamma_{112}$ correlator, the $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$ correlator, and the signed balance functions, however, are also subject to non-CME backgrounds, including those from resonance decays. A previous study showed that the CME observables are affected by the diagonal component of the spin density matrix, the $\rho_{00}$ for vector mesons. In this work, we study the contributions from the other elements of the spin density matrix using a toy model and a multiphase transport model. We find that the real part of the $\rho_{1-1}$ component, $\mathrm{Re}\,\rho_{1-1}$, affects the CME observables in a manner opposite to that of the $\rho_{00}$. All three aforementioned CME observables show a linear dependence on $\mathrm{Re}\,\rho_{1-1}$ in the model calculations, supporting our analytical derivations. The rest elements of the spin density matrix do not contribute to the CME observables. The off-diagonal terms in the spin density matrix indicate spin coherence and may be nonzero in heavy-ion collisions due to local spin polarization or spin-spin correlations. Thus, $\mathrm{Re}\,\rho_{1-1}$, along with $\rho_{00}$, could play a significant role in interpreting measurements in search of the CME.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave analysis to determine the spin of $\Xi(1690)^-$ and $\Xi(1820)^-$ produced in $\overline{p}p$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently [arXiv:2201.03852v2] the PANDA collaboration studied the feasibility of determining the spin and parity of the $\Xi(1690)^{-}$and $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ resonances in the $\Lambda K^-$ system produced in $\bar{p}p$ collisions via the reaction channel $\overline{p} p \rightarrow \bar{\Xi}^{+} \Lambda K^{-}$. This contribution aims to study these reactions using a model-independent irreducible tensor formalism developed earlier. This study leads us to identify the partial-wave amplitude, which would be zero if $\Xi(1690)^{-}$ or $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ had spin-1/2, provided these resonances are produced at threshold (s-wave production).</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparencies with a two step process of the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear transparency in pion-induced nuclear reactions has been investigated on the basis of Glauber multiple scattering theory considering a two-step process within the framework of vector meson dominance (VMD). In the present context, the application of the quantum diffusion model (QDM) to the Glauber theory plays a role in explaining the dependence of the transparency on the four momentum transfer squared $Q^2$. % as shown in the experimental data. The short-range correlation (SRC) considered further gives the contribution to the magnitude of the transparency by a constant amount independent of the $Q^2$ variation, and the results from the QDM and SRC overestimate the experimental data. The inclusion of the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section, $\sigma_{\rho N}=3 $ mb has the effect of reducing the transparency and thus leads to a good agreement with the experimental data on the reaction $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <title>Emergent chirality and superfluidity of parity-doubled baryons in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel superfluids induced by the parity-doubled baryons. The parity-doubled baryons, i.e., a nucleon $N(940)$ with spin-parity $J^{P}=1/2^{+}$ and an excited nucleon $N^{\ast}(1535)$ with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ in vacuum, become degenerate at sufficiently high density where the chiral symmetry is restored. In this study, we extend the conventional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ chiral symmetry to the higher dimensional symmetries, dubbed emergent chiral symmetries, including the naive and mirror assignments as their subgroups. Starting with the Lagrangian up to four-point interactions among the neutron $n$ and its chiral partner $n^{\ast}$, neutral components in $N$ and $N^{\ast}$, in pure neutron matter, we investigate the properties of the ground state with a pairing gap generated by the $n$ and $n^{\ast}$ in the mean-field approximation. We find vector-type condensates that induce the dynamical breaking of a new class of internal symmetries, emergent chiral symmetries, as well as the baryon number and the rotational symmetries of the real space, indicating the appearance of massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons consisting of six quarks: emergent pions, superfluid phonons, and magnons, respectively. We also study the fermionic excitation modes at low-energy scales, and show that they exhibit a spatial anisotropy of the propagation at the Dirac cone in momentum space. Some phenomenological implications are advocated, shedding new light on the properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A simple explanation for the absence of the spherical nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to a simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the color degree of freedom is required even at the low energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven entanglement forging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating a physical system with variational quantum algorithms is a well-studied approach but challenging to implement in current devices due to demands in qubit number and circuit depth. We show how limited knowledge of the system, namely the entropy of its subsystems or its entanglement structure, can be used to reduce the cost of these algorithms with entanglement forging. To do so, we simulate a Fermi-Hubbard one-dimensional chain with a parametrized hopping term, as well as atomic nuclei ${}^{28}$Ne and ${}^{60}$Ti with the nuclear shell model. Using an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver we find significant reductions in both the maximum number of qubits (up to one fourth) and the amount of two-qubit gates (over an order of magnitude) required in the quantum circuits. Our findings indicate that our method, entropy-driven entanglement forging, can be used to adjust quantum simulations to the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nuclear equation of state from orbits of primordial black holes inside neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lacking terrestrial experimental data, our best constraints on the behavior of matter at high densities up to and above nuclear density arise from observations of neutron stars. Current constraints include those based on measurements of stellar masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities. Here we explore how orbits of primordial black holes - should they exist - inside neutron stars could provide complementary constraints on the nuclear equation of state (EOS). Specifically, we consider a sample of candidate EOSs, construct neutron star models for these EOSs, and compute orbits of primordial black holes inside these stars. We discuss how the pericenter advance of eccentric orbits, i.e. orbital precession, results in beat phenomena in the emitted gravitational wave signal. Observing this beat frequency could constrain the nuclear EOS and break possible degeneracies arising from other constraints, as well as provide information about the host star.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge separation for paired Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions at finite density coupled to a complex pairing field assumed to obey scalar field theory with quartic self-repulsion. The bulk of our work develops the mathematics that elucidates the propagation of fermionic excitations in such systems as independent spin (boosts) and charge (fermion number) degrees of freedom. A necessary ingredient is the presence of broken $U(1)$ symmetry in the pairing field and decoupling of its density and phase. In the fermion sector, these elements give rise to an emergent spin-dependent gauge coupling which binds in-vacuum spin and charge into elementary fermions, while driving proliferation of unbound spin and charge for finite condensation in the pairing field. Notably, the onset of spin-charge separation is signaled by $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetry breaking and decoupling of spin components under Lorentz transformations. Our investigation concludes with two theorems that identify generic features of spin-charge separation in such systems.</description>

      <title>Leptodermic corrections to the TOV equations and nuclear astrophysics within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop at the equilibrium is used to extend the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations taking into account
  the gradient terms responsible for the system surface. The parameters of the Schwarzschild metric in the spherical case are found with these surface corrections in the
  leading (zero) order of the leptodermic approximation $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the NS effective-surface (ES) thickness, and $R$ is the effective NS radius. The energy
  density $\mathcal{E}$ is considered in a general form including the functions of the particle number density and of its gradient terms. The macroscopic gravitational
  potential $\Phi(\rho)$ is taken into account in the simplest form as expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density,
  up to second order, in terms of its contributions to th separation particle energy and incompressibility. Density distributions $\rho$ across the NS ES in the normal
  direction to the ES, which are derived in the simple analytical form at the same leading approximation, was used for the derivation of the modified TOV (MTOV) equations
  by accounting for their NS surface corrections. The MTOV equations are analytically solved at first order and the results are compared with the standard TOV approach of
  the zero order.</description>

      <title>Formation of twin compact stars in low-mass X-ray binaries: Implications on eccentric and isolated millisecond pulsar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are laboratories for stellar evolution, strong gravity, and ultra-dense matter. Although MSPs are thought to originate in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, while others are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding how these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of neutron stars (NSs).
  We study the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order phase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigate whether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as neutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, may leave an observable long-lasting imprint on the orbit.
  We simulate mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass main sequence companion, following the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and spin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we assume a multipolytrope equation-of-state that allows for a sharp phase transition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational constraints.
  We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe overflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition may occur during the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this transition may take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric binary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick (w &gt; 20 km/s), the binary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or reconfigured to an ultra-wide orbit.
  Our results suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for forming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the orbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long (&gt; 50 d) orbital periods could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the approach derived by Caron-Huot and Gale from the BDMPS-Z formalism, we obtain medium-induced parton splitting rates in a Bjorken expanding QCD matter. We compare the rate with the case of a static medium and investigate the impact of the medium expansion on the splitting rate. We also consider the leading order in the opacity expansion and the harmonic oscillator solution. These approximations are recovered in the limits of small and large formation times, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the leading Fock-state light front wave functions (LF-LFWFs) of heavy flavor-asymmetric pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $B$ and $B_c$ from their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions based on Dyson-Schwinger equations approach, and study their leading twist parton distribution amplitudes, generalized parton distribution functions and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. The spatial distributions of the quark and antiquark on the transverse plane are given, along with their charge and energy distributions on the light front. We find that in the considered mesons, the heavier quarks carry most longitudinal momentum fraction and yield narrow $x$-distributions, while the lighter quarks play an active role in shaping the transverse distributions within both spatial and momentum space, exhibiting a duality embodying characteristics from both light mesons and heavy quarkonium.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $a_0$, $f_0$, $f_2$, and $K^*_2$ resonances as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Confronting new NICER mass-radius measurements with phase transition in dense matter and compact twin stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (re)analysis of data on the X-ray emitting pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as new results on PSR J0437-4715, are confronted with the predictions of the equation of state (EoS) models allowing for strong first-order phase transition for the mass-radius ($M$-$R$) diagram. We use models that are based on a covariant density functional (CDF) EoS for nucleonic matter at low densities and a quark matter EoS, parameterized by the speed of sound, at higher densities. To account for the variations in the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 obtained from different analyses, we examined three scenarios to assess their consistency with our models, focusing particularly on the potential formation of twin stars. We found that in two scenarios, where the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437-4715 with masses close to the canonical mass $\sim 1.4\,M_{\odot}$ are significantly separated, our models allow for the presence of twin stars as a natural explanation for potential differences in the radii of these stars.</description>

      <title>Does nuclear medium affect the transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions of valence quark of pions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the valence quark transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, pions, in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature by employing a light-cone quark model. The medium modifications in the pion unpolarized TMDs are induced through the effective quark masses computed using the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. The spin densities at different momentum fraction ($x$) have also been calculated at different baryonic densities.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at the LHC with rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma, leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC energies. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as charged particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged-particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a similar quantitative enhancement as seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>

      <title>Bound state basics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbative expansions for atoms in QED are developed around interacting states, typically defined by the Schr\"odinger equation. Calculations are nevertheless done using the standard Feynman diagram expansion around free states. The classical $-\alpha/r$ potential is then obtained through an infinite sum of ladder diagrams. The complexity of this approach may have contributed to bound states being omitted from QFT textbooks, restricting the field to select experts.
  The confinement scale 1 fm of QCD must be introduced without changing the Lagrangian. This can be done via a boundary condition on the gauge field, which affects the bound state potential. The absence of confinement in Feynman diagrams may be due to the free field boundary condition.
  Poincar\'e invariance is realized dynamically for bound states, i.e., the interactions are frame dependent. Gauge theories have instantaneous interactions, due to gauge fixing at all points of space at the same time. In bound state perturbation theory each order must have exact Poincar\'e invariance. This is non-trivial even for atoms at lowest order.
  I summarize a perturbative approach to equal time bound states in QED and QCD, using a Fock expansion in temporal ($A^0=0$) gauge. The longitudinal electric field $E_L$ is instantaneous and need not vanish at spatial infinity for the constituents of color singlet states in QCD. Poincar\'e covariance determines the boundary condition for $E_L$ up to a universal scale, characterised by the gluon field energy density of the vacuum. A non-vanishing density contributes a linear term to the $q\bar{q}$ potential, while $qqq,\ q\bar{q}g$ and $gg$ color singlet states get analogous confining potentials.</description>

      <title>Exclusive vector-quarkonium photoproduction at NLO in alpha_s in collinear factorisation with evolution of the generalised parton distributions and high-energy resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first complete one-loop study of exclusive photoproduction of vector quarkonia off protons in Collinear Factorisation (CF) including the scale evolution of the Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs). We confirm the perturbative instability of the cross section at high photon-proton-collision energies (W_gamma+p) at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in alpha_s and solve this issue by resumming higher-order QCD corrections, which are enhanced by a logarithm of the parton energies, using High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) in the Doubly-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA) matched to CF. Our NLO CF + DLA HEF results are in agreement with the latest HERA data, show a smaller sensitivity to the factorisation and renormalisation scales compared to Born-order results. Quark-induced channels via interference with gluon ones are found to contribute at most 20% of the cross section for W_gamma+p &gt; 100 GeV. Our results also show that such exclusive cross sections cannot be accurately obtained from the square of usual Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and clearly illustrate the importance of quarkonium exclusive photoproduction to advance our understanding of the 3D content of the nucleon in terms of gluons. Our work provides an important step towards a correct interpretation of present and future experimental data collected at HERA, the EIC, the LHC and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically conformal CFL quark matter within a nonlocal chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a three-flavor nonlocal NJL model of quark matter with the scalar attractive, vector repulsive and diquark pairing interaction channels. The model is treated within the separable approximation to obtain the EoS of cold quark matter. The analysis of the high density asymptotics of the model allows us to conclude about its qualitative agreement with the perturbative QCD. Particularly, a color superconducting CFL state is found to be the ground one at high densities. The conformal limit of speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure are also shown to be reached from below and above, respectively. The model is applied to modelling NSs within the scenario of early quark deconfinement triggered by the gravitational instability of the NS matter due to the BEC of a spin-color-flavor singlet three-diquark bound state, the light sexaquark, stable against the weak and strong decays. A conservative estimate of the sexaquark mass based on the most up-to-date results from QCD sum rules and a constituent quark model assumes an early quark deconfinement with the onset mass below $1~\rm M_\odot$. The scenario is shown to be consistent with the present observational constraints on the mass-radius relation and tidal deformability of NSs. Given the fact that the proposed model by construction exhibits an asymptotically conformal behavior, we consider the question about approximately conformal quark matter in NSs. We report a non-perturbative energy density range, which is inaccessible in NSs and where the speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure of the CFL quark matter simultaneously attain the conformal values.</description>

      <title>Effects of Phi and $\sigma^{*}$-meson on properties of hyperon stars including $\Delta$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00007v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of neutron stars using the linear Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory and consider multiple degrees of freedom inside neutron stars, including hyperons and $\Delta$ resonances. We investigate different coupling parameters $x_{\sigma \Delta}$ between $\Delta$ resonances and nucleons and compare the differences between neutron stars with and without strange mesons $\sigma^*$ and $\phi$. These effects include particle number distributions, equations of state (EOS), mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. To overcome the "hyperon puzzle," we employ the $\sigma-cut$ scheme to obtain neutron stars with masses up to $2M_{\odot}$. We find that strange mesons appear at around 3$\rho_0$ and reduce the critical density of baryons in the high-density region. With increasing coupling parameter $x_{\sigma \Delta}$, the $\Delta$ resonances suppress hyperons, leading to a shift of the critical density towards lower values. The early appearance of $\Delta$ resonances may play a crucial role in the stability of neutron stars. Strange mesons soften the EOS slightly, while $\Delta$ resonances predominantly soften the EOS in the low-density region. By calculating tidal deformabilities and comparing with astronomical observation GW170817, we find that the inclusion of $\Delta$ resonances decreases the radius of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations Drive Angular Momenta in Nuclear Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are ubiquitous and play crucial roles across various scales and systems, such as the Big Bang, black hole dynamics, quantum phase transitions in microscopic many-body systems, and so on. Nuclear fission manifests as a complex nuclear shape stretching until it splits into fragments with substantial angular momenta, also exhibiting complex quantum fluctuations and specifically shape fluctuations. For over 40 years, researchers have puzzled how the fission fragment angular momenta are generated dynamically from (almost) zero spin, as well as the particular role played by quantum fluctuations. Here, for the first time, we report the quantum shape fluctuations that drive fragment angular momenta during nuclear fission, based on a global, microscopic, and dynamical simulation. The calculated probability distributions of fragment angular momenta are in good agreement with the experimental measurements, and the sawtooth-like mass dependence of average angular momenta is reproduced very well. It is noteworthy to find that the shape fluctuations -- multiple rotations, vibrations, and their couplings -- drive the generation and chaotic evolution of fragment angular momenta during fission fragment formation and induce strong correlations between angular momentum orientations of partner fragments at small, medium, and large opening angles ($\phi_{LH}\approx 30^\circ, 90^\circ, 160^\circ$). Our work not only deepens the fundamental understanding of the nuclear fission mechanism but also has implications for the $\gamma$-ray heating problem in nuclear reactors and the synthesis of superheavy elements.</description>

Abstract: We present a relativistic Shakhov-type generalization of the Anderson-Witting relaxation time model for the Boltzmann collision integral to modify the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. This is achieved by modifying the path on which the single particle distribution function $f_{\mathbf{k}}$ approaches local equilibrium $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ by constructing an intermediate Shakhov-type distribution $f_{\mathrm{S}\mathbf{k}}$ similar to the 14-moment approximation of Israel and Stewart. We illustrate the effectiveness of this model in case of the Bjorken expansion of an ideal gas of massive particles and the damping of longitudinal waves through an ultrarelativistic ideal gas.</description>

      <title>High-order Shakhov-like extension of the relaxation time approximation in relativistic kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a relativistic Shakhov-type generalization of the Anderson-Witting relaxation time model for the Boltzmann collision integral. The extension is performed by modifying the path on which the distribution function $f_{\mathbf{k}}$ is taken towards local equilibrium $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$, by replacing $f_{\mathbf{k}} - f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ via $f_{\mathbf{k}} - f_{{\rm S}\mathbf{k}}$. The Shakhov-like distribution $f_{{\rm S} \mathbf{k}}$ is constructed using $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ and the irreducible moments $\rho_r^{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_\ell}$ of $f_\mathbf{k}$ and reduces to $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ in local equilibrium. Employing the method of moments, we derive systematic high-order Shakhov extensions that allow both the first- and the second-order transport coefficients to be controlled independently of each other. We illustrate the capabilities of the formalism by tweaking the shear-bulk coupling coefficient $\lambda_{\Pi \pi}$ in the frame of the Bjorken flow of massive particles, as well as the diffusion-shear transport coefficients $\ell_{V\pi}$, $\ell_{\pi V}$ in the frame of sound wave propagation in an ultrarelativistic gas. Finally, we illustrate the importance of second-order transport coefficients by comparison with the results of the stochastic BAMPS method in the context of the one-dimensional Riemann problem.</description>

      <title>A unitary coupled-channel three-body amplitude with pions and kaons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-body dynamics above threshold is required for the reliable extraction of many amplitudes and resonances from experiment and lattice QCD. The S-matrix principle of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel approaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging two-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of a three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The unequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems ("isobars") of all isospins, $I=0,\,1/2,\,1,\, 3/2, \, 2$, and it also allows for transitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\, ("\sigma"),\,f_0(980),\,\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\,("\kappa")$, and $K^*(892)$ resonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to evaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production amplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense,
  neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from
  weak-interaction-driven direct URCA processes. The quark matter is
  modeled using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model improved to account for
  vector and 't Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing
  among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations
  are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute
  the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and
  electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The
  resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1--10\,kHz
  range shows a resonant peak at $T\sim 5\,\MeV$, and the damping time
  may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to affect the
  postmerger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted
  in nuclear matter.</description>

Abstract: In the context of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we explore the stochastic and dissipative relaxational dynamics of a non-conserved order parameter in a $\lambda\varphi^4$ interaction. The cutoff of the theory is provided by the lattice spacing chosen for our numerical simulations. As a consequence, observables become dependent on that scale. We consider a possible first-order phase transition and an evolution close to a critical point. We demonstrate that using a lattice counterterm restores the expected behavior of the mean, variance and kurtosis: the mean and the variance become lattice spacing independent, and we recover the correct expectation value of the mean, the growth of the variance with the correlation length and the expected minimum in the kurtosis. Our findings hold true in equilibrium and during the dynamical relaxation, and therefore mark an important step towards a fully fluctuating fluid dynamical setup.</description>

      <title>End-to-end complexity for simulating the Schwinger model on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model is one of the simplest gauge theories. It is known that a topological term of the model leads to the infamous sign problem in the classical Monte Carlo method. In contrast to this, recently, quantum computing in Hamiltonian formalism has gained attention. In this work, we estimate the resources needed for quantum computers to compute physical quantities that are challenging to compute on classical computers. Specifically, we propose an efficient implementation of block-encoding of the Schwinger model Hamiltonian. Considering the structure of the Hamiltonian, this block-encoding with a normalization factor of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ can be implemented using $\mathcal{O}(N+\log^2(N/\varepsilon))$ T gates. As an end-to-end application, we compute the vacuum persistence amplitude. As a result, we found that for a system size $N=128$ and an additive error $\varepsilon=0.01$, with an evolution time $t$ and a lattice spacing a satisfying $t/2a=10$, the vacuum persistence amplitude can be calculated using about $10^{13}$ T gates. Our results provide insights into predictions about the performance of quantum computers in the FTQC and early FTQC era, clarifying the challenges in solving meaningful problems within a realistic timeframe.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic nuclear reduction for tensor couplings in dark matter direct detection and $\mu \to e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonrelativistic effective field theory (NRET) is widely used in dark matter direct detection and charged-lepton flavor violation studies through $\mu \to e$ conversion. However, existing literature has not fully considered tensor couplings. This study fills this gap by utilizing an innovative tensor decomposition method, extending NRET to incorporate previously overlooked tensor interactions. This development is expected to have a significant impact on ongoing experiments seeking physics beyond the Standard Model and on our understanding of the new-physics interactions. Notably, we identify additional operators in $\mu \to e$ conversion that are absent in scalar and vector couplings. To support further research and experimental analyses, comprehensive tables featuring tensor matrix elements and their corresponding operators are provided.</description>

      <title>The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>
