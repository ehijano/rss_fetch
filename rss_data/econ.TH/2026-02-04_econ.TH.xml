      <title>Endogenous Product Design: A Linear Demand Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a linear-demand framework to investigate endogenous product design. The key assumption is that the same product characteristics which drive goods utility also (at least partially) shape competitive interactions across products. I model this relationship allowing for differences in each characteristic's relevance to competition, their absolute intensity per good, and correlations to other characteristics. The framework is novel in its broad applicability to settings with any finite number of goods, firms, and attributes, allowing for both vertical and horizontal differentiation, all in an empirically testable model. Under Bertrand price competition I show that across different market structures, a pattern emerges: product differentiation along product attributes that firms control is primarily vertical, with horizontal differentiation only in latent attributes. Counter to standard intuition, simulations show that allowing for endogenous design can imply higher consumer surplus under monopoly than under competition, as monopoly's stronger incentives for attribute investment translate into higher effective quality.</description>

      <title>Using OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture to Estimate Future Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an entirely new physics founded approach to estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC). For this, we developed our Ocean-Heat-Content Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) to estimate future heat content (separately published). The heat conjecture assumes that weather damages curves are stochastically proportional to ocean heat increase. We model carbon combustion, validate to datasets for greenhouse gas (GHG), temperature, and ocean heat content (OHC). We show that the social cost of 4 GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O and halogenated hydrocarbons, cannot be single values, but must be represented by a kind of economic phase space.
  We propose very long-term carbon bonds to implement real discounting. This obviates the Gordian knot of the descriptivist versus prescriptivist discount disagreement that is unsolvable. Implementing these bonds leads to a new monitoring metric: real-dollar spending and bond discount rates compared to SC-GHG cost with variation on the discount scale, where the discount has no relationship to the pure rate of time preference (PRTP).
  This heat conjecture is based on OPTiMEM. OPTiMEM initiates from a fossil fuel consumption function to produce CO2, with 18 scenarios implemented to provide the uncertainty range. We provide 1:N year loss risk models (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) that government, engineers, and actuaries should find useful.
  A scenario implementing DICE family of models carbon and growth assumptions shows +18{\deg} C is breached by 2210 CE, and +110{\deg} C by 2300 CE -- both of which outcomes are obviously not compatible with the fairly rosy conclusions of DICE models.
  Concerns are raised about having enough low-cost fossil fuel for conversion to minimal CO$_2$ maximal energy return on energy invested (EROEI) power if nations wait too long, and low EROEI power is questioned because monetary value is dependent on energy.</description>

      <title>Nested search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce and study a nested search problem modeled as a tree structure that generalizes Weitzman (1979) in two ways: (1) search progresses incrementally, reflecting real-life scenarios where agents gradually acquire information about the prizes; and (2) the realization of prizes can be correlated, capturing similarities among them. I derive the optimal policy, which takes the form of an index solution. I apply this result to study monopolistic competition in a market with two stages of product inspection. My application illustrates that regulations on drip pricing lower equilibrium price and raise consumer surplus.</description>

      <title>The Innovation Tax: Generative AI Adoption, Productivity Paradox, and Systemic Risk in the U.S. Banking Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the causal impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) adoption on productivity and systemic risk in the U.S. banking sector. Using a novel dataset linking SEC 10-Q filings to Federal Reserve regulatory data for 809 financial institutions over 2018--2025, we employ two complementary identification strategies: Dynamic Spatial Durbin Models (DSDM) to capture network spillovers and Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) for causal inference using the November 2022 ChatGPT release as an exogenous shock. Our findings reveal a striking ``Productivity Paradox'': while DSDM estimates show that AI-adopting banks are high performers ($\beta &gt; 0$), the causal SDID analysis documents a significant ``Implementation Tax'' -- adopting banks experience a 428-basis-point decline in ROE as they absorb GenAI integration costs. This tax falls disproportionately on smaller institutions, with bottom-quartile banks suffering a 517-basis-point ROE decline compared to 129 basis points for larger banks, suggesting that economies of scale provide significant advantages in AI implementation. Most critically, our DSDM analysis reveals significant positive spillovers ($\theta = 0.161$ for ROA, $p &lt; 0.01$; $\theta = 0.679$ for ROE, $p &lt; 0.05$), with spillovers among large banks reaching $\theta = 3.13$ for ROE, indicating that the U.S. banking system is becoming ``algorithmically coupled.'' This synchronization of AI-driven decision-making creates a new channel for systemic contagion: a technical failure in widely-adopted AI models could trigger correlated shocks across the entire financial network.</description>

      <title>Dual Attainment in Multi-Period Multi-Asset Martingale Optimal Transport and Its Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dual attainment for the multimarginal, multi-asset martingale optimal transport (MOT) problem, a fundamental question in the mathematical theory of model-independent pricing and hedging in quantitative finance. Our main result proves the existence of dual optimizers under mild regularity and irreducibility conditions, extending previous duality and attainment results from the classical and two-marginal settings to arbitrary numbers of assets and time periods. This theoretical advance provides a rigorous foundation for robust pricing and hedging of complex, path-dependent financial derivatives. To support our analysis, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the practical solvability of large-scale discrete MOT problems using the state-of-the-art primal-dual linear programming (PDLP) algorithm. In particular, we solve multi-dimensional (or vectorial) MOT instances arising from the robust pricing of worst-of autocallable options, confirming the accuracy and feasibility of our theoretical results. Our work advances the mathematical understanding of MOT and highlights its relevance for robust financial engineering in high-dimensional and model-uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Group Selection as a Safeguard Against AI Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to "cultural collapse", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Instability in Strategy-Proof Matching Mechanism Using A Linear Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of one-to-one matching mechanisms that are strategy-proof for both sides and as stable as possible. Motivated by the impossibility result of Roth (1982), we formulate the mechanism design problem as a linear program that minimizes stability violations subject to exact strategy-proofness constraints. We consider both an average-case objective (summing violations over all preference profiles) and a worst-case objective (minimizing the maximum violation across profiles), and we show that imposing anonymity and symmetry when the number of agents in both sides are the same can be done without loss of optimality. Computationally, for small markets our approach yields randomized mechanisms with substantially lower stability violations than randomized sequential dictatorship (RSD); in the $3\times 3$ case the optimum reduces average instability to roughly one third of RSD. For deterministic mechanisms with three students and three schools, we find that any two-sided strategy-proof mechanism has at least two blocking pairs in the worst case and we provide a simple algorithm that attains this bound. Finally, we propose an extension to larger markets and present simulation evidence that, relative to sequential dictatorship (SD), it reduces the number of blocking pairs by about $0.25$ on average.</description>

      <title>A Micro-Distributional Theory of the Aggregate Labor Share:Firm Size Distribution and Technological Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global decline in the labor income share has challenged the classical Kaldor facts; however, the macroeconomic aggregation mechanism -- namely, how aggregate factor shares emerge from firm-level heterogeneity -- remains underexplored. This paper bridges this gap by constructing a theoretical framework that links firm size distribution to aggregate factor shares. We extend Houthakker's aggregation theory and formalize the \textit{weighting effect}: when large firms are systematically more capital-intensive than small firms, a shift in market structure toward larger firms mechanically reduces the aggregate labor share. Using comprehensive firm-level data from Chinese manufacturing (2001--2015), we empirically validate this mechanism. First, we estimate production function parameters and confirm that capital elasticity significantly exceeds labor elasticity, implying a negative relationship between firm size and labor share. Second, we find that the negative effect of firm size on labor share is significant only in industries with high technological heterogeneity. Counterfactual decomposition reveals that the shift in the size distribution toward ``superstar firms'' during 2001--2015 constitutes the primary driver of the labor share decline. Our findings provide a technical micro-foundation for the ``superstar firm'' hypothesis and highlight the distributional consequences of ``winner-take-all'' market structures.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive involvement and resolvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and $n$-voter resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding some set of up to $n$ voters). This impossibility theorem holds for any positive integer $n$. It also holds if either the Condorcet loser criterion is replaced by independence of clones or positive involvement is replaced by negative involvement.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mechanism Design without Monetary Transfers: A Queueing Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of optimal allocation mechanisms in an environment where agents and goods arrive stochastically. Agents have private types that determine the principal payoff. Either agents or goods can be held in a queue at a flow cost until allocation. The principal cannot use monetary transfers, but can verify agents types at a cost. We characterize the optimal mechanism at the steady state of the system. It is a dynamic threshold mechanism in which the principal sets type thresholds for agent admission and goods allocation. These thresholds depend on the current state of the mechanism. The model applies to public programs such as public housing and grant allocation, and to allocation problems within organizations such as capital budgeting.</description>

      <title>The Learning Approach to Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified framework for analyzing games in greater depth. In the existing literature, players' strategies are typically assigned scalar values, and equilibrium concepts are used to identify compatible choices. However, this approach neglects the internal structure of players, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors.
  To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player, consistent with constructions in reinforcement learning. Instead of defining games as external settings, our framework defines them in terms of the players themselves. This offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for this generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler models or compatibility analysis.
  For a general definition of a player, we discuss natural conditions on its components and define competition through their behavior. In the discrete setting, we consider players whose estimates largely follow the standard framework from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we conclude by examining relations to reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Emergent Alignment via Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values remains a fundamental challenge, but does our inability to create perfectly aligned models preclude obtaining the benefits of alignment? We study a strategic setting where a human user interacts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are individually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies approximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that becomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition can yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We model this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to multi-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three results: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her Bayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex hull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility learning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal utility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI after an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without further distributional assumptions. We complement the theory with two sets of experiments.</description>
