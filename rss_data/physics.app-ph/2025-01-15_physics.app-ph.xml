      <title>Quantitive evaluation of composition and biomolecular mapping of macrofungi spores by Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is widely applied to detect different chemical compounds in organic matter and create label-free high-resolution maps on the level of separate cells. The main advantage of this technique is the possibility to study objects in vivo without special pretreatment. However, it is rarely used to determine ratios between different substances or to perform deep quantitative analysis of the obtained spectra. In our study, we derive ratiometric equations that allow estimating the mass concentrations of triacylglycerols, proteins, sugars, polysaccharides, and DNA. We show that it is possible to determine average unsaturation and chain length from the spectra of lipids and concentrations of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan from the spectra of proteins. We apply the derived equations to the Raman spectra of fungal spores of over 70 different species of macrofungi. We provide detailed characterization of lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides, which are contained in the spores. We believe that our study not only provides new fundamental knowledge in the field of mycology but also can become a basis for spectral quantification of any organic material, and our approach can be applied, for instance, to food diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Sensor for Perfluorooctanoic Acid Detection Using Two-dimensional Aluminium Quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred as "forever chemicals," are pervasive environmental pollutants due to their resistance to degradation. Among these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) poses significant threats to human health, contaminating water sources globally. Here, we have demonstrated the potential of a novel electrochemical sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) aluminium-based multicomponent quasicrystals (2D-Al QC) for the ultrasensitive sub-picomolar level detection of PFOA. The 2D-Al QC-inked electrode was employed here to detect PFOA by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The limit of detection (LoD) achieved is 0.59 +/- 0.05 pM. The sensor was evaluated for selectivity with other interfering compounds, repeatability of cycles, and reproducibility for five similar electrodes with a deviation of 0.8 %. The stability of the sensor has also been analysed after ninety days ,which shows a minimal variation of 15%. Spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations were further utilized to understand the interaction between the 2D-Al QC and PFOA. The results demonstrate that the 2D-Al QC offers a promising platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of PFOA, potentially addressing current environmental monitoring challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality is a fascinating natural phenomenon with widespread applications in scientific research. Toroidal responses, distinct from chiral responses, represent an emerging and intriguing field that investigates toroidal electromagnetic phenomena. This field has garnered significant attention following the first experimental observations of oscillating toroidal dipoles and electromagnetic toroidal pulses. Breaking the symmetry of toroidal responses and observing chiral toroidal responses are crucial for advancing our understanding of toroidal phenomena and expanding the theoretical and practical applications of toroidal electrodynamics. Here, we present two complementary methods for breaking the symmetry of toroidal pulses and generating chiral space-time nonseparable helical pulses (SNHPs)-quasi-linearly polarized and chiral toroidal-across the optical and microwave spectral ranges. This was achieved through polarization decomposition of toroidal light pulses and direct emission from an ultrawideband spiral antenna, respectively. These advancements pave the way for experimental investigations into information transfer and light-matter interactions involving chiral SNHPs, including toroid-vortex coupling, classical-quantal entanglement, and optical machining, all of which are of growing interest in both fundamental science and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of helium surface fluctuations on the Rydberg transition of trapped electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium is an extremely clean system which holds promise for a scalable qubit platform. However, the superfluid surface is not free from fluctuations which might cause the decay and dephasing of the electrons quantized states. Understanding and mitigating these fluctuations is essential for the advancement of electrons-on-helium (eHe) qubit technology. Some work has been recently done to investigate surface oscillations due to the mechanical vibration of the cryostat using a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. In the present work, we focus on a sub-hertz frequency range and observe a strong effect of surface oscillations on the temporal dynamics of the Rydberg transition of electrons confined in a microchannel trapping device. We suggest possible origin of such oscillations and find a reasonable agreement between the corresponding estimation of the oscillation frequency and the observed result.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Higher-Order Exceptional Points via Non-Hermitian Zero-Index Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) in optical structures enable ultra-sensitive responses to perturbations. However, previous investigations on higher-order EPs have predominantly focused on coupled systems, leaving their fundamental physics in open scattering systems largely unexplored. Here, we harness wave interference to realize higher-order EPs in non-Hermitian zero-index materials connected to multiple open channels. Specifically, we demonstrate that a three-channel model can give rise to three interesting types of third-order EPs: lasing EP, reflecting EP, and absorbing EP. Notably, near the third-order absorbing EP, we observe ultrasensitivity--a drastic change in output power in response to perturbations at the operating frequency--in a purely lossy system. These findings pave the way for achieving higher-order and even arbitrary-order EPs in open scattering systems, offering significant potential for advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Guiding polaritonic energy and momentum through two-dimensional Bravais lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong exciton absorption in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides provides a promising platform for studying polaritons with tunable dispersions, which are crucial for controlling polaritonic energy and momentum, but remain underexplored. In this work, monolayer MoS$_2$ is coupled with a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices with sub-wavelength periods, based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars, are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle-resolved reflectance measurements. Back-space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using the two-port two-mode model. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, from 90{\deg}, 60{\deg}, 45{\deg}, and 30{\deg} to arbitrary values. By adjusting the lattice vector lengths, the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine-tuned, enabling full-range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.</description>

      <title>Frequency Fluctuations in Nanomechanical Resonators due to Quantum Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators promise diverse applications ranging from mass spectrometry to quantum information processing, requiring long phonon lifetimes and frequency stability. Although two-level system (TLS) defects govern dissipation at millikelvin temperatures, the nature of frequency fluctuations remains poorly understood. In nanoscale devices, where acoustic fields are confined to sub-wavelength volumes, strong coupling to individual TLS should dominate over weak coupling to defect ensembles. In this work, we monitor fast frequency fluctuations of phononic crystal nanomechanical resonators, while varying temperature ($10$ mK$-1$ K), drive power ($10^2-10^5$ phonons), and the phononic band structure. We consistently observe random telegraph signals (RTS) which we attribute to state transitions of individual TLS. The frequency noise is well-explained by mechanical coupling to individual far off-resonant TLS, which are either thermally excited or strongly coupled to thermal fluctuators. Understanding this fundamental decoherence process, particularly its RTS structure, opens a clear path towards noise suppression for quantum and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Surface and Bulk Two-Level System Losses in Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) is a promising material for building acoustic resonators used in quantum applications, but its performance is limited by poorly understood material defects called two-level systems (TLS). In this work, we fabricate high-performance acoustic resonators from LN with quality factors up to $6\times10^7$ and use them to separate bulk and surface contributions to TLS loss. By comparing these bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators with previous surface acoustic wave and phononic crystal studies, we show that devices with high surface participation ratios are limited by surface TLS, while our BAW devices reveal an intrinsic bulk TLS limit. Through systematic surface treatments and microscopy, we demonstrate that BAW resonator performance remains unchanged despite surface modifications, confirming operation in a bulk-limited regime. Our work establishes quantitative bounds on both surface and bulk TLS losses in LN, within the context of material growth and fabrication approaches we have pursued, and provides guidance for future device engineering and materials development.</description>

      <title>Spin Photonic Topological Insulator Antenna By Armchair Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new X-band leaky wave antenna has been developed using spin photonic topological insulators. This antenna features a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This arrangement provides advantages over the zigzag configuration, particularly by offering a wider leaky region and a more suitable pattern. To design the structure, a parametric study on the cell dimensions has been conducted, and another study has designed the transition region to couple the topological structure with the classical line. The proposed antenna has a low profile and illuminates two sides of the structure simultaneously. Additionally, it offers a 53-degree scanning range and a bandwidth of 2.7 GHz, making it a groundbreaking improvement over other leaky wave antennas that utilize photonic topological insulators. The proposed antenna is a unbalaned CRLH leaky wave antenna that can radiate in both backward and forward directions. Notably, when transitioning through the broadside in the scanning range, there is no significant drop in performance despite the existence of an open stop band. To the best of our knowledge, this characteristic appears to be unique among unbalaned CRLH leaky wave antennas.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the FR4 Microwave Dielectric Properties at Cryogenic Temperature for Quantum-Chip-Interface PCBs Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ad-hoc interface PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) are today the standard connection between cryogenic cabling and quantum chips. Besides low-loss and low-temperature-dependent-dielectric-permittivity materials, Flame Resistance n.4 (FR4) provides a low-cost solution for fabrication of cryogenic PCBs. Here, we report on an effective way to evaluate the dielectric performance of a FR4 laminate used as substrate for cryogenic microwave PCBs. We designed a coplanar waveguide {\lambda}/2 open-circuit series resonator, and we fabricated the PCB using a low-cost manufacturing process, obtaining in-plane geometric features with maximum variations of 50-100 um compared to the PCB design. Such a geometry allows to exploit the resonance peak of the resonator to measure the variation of the complex permittivity as a function of the temperature. The resonance peak frequency was used to estimate the real permittivity, achieving a sensitivity of -470 MHz and a resolution of 1.2x10^-2. Similarly, the resonance peak magnitude was involved in the extrapolation of the loss tangent, reaching a sensitivity of ~-337 dB and a resolution of 1.6x^10-4. For the FR4 laminate used, we estimated a 9 % reduction of the real permittivity and a 70 % reduction of the loss tangent in the temperature range from 300 to 4 K. The proposed approach can be immediately extended to the detection of cryogenic temperature-dependent dielectric performance of any kind of substrate.</description>

      <title>Physically Guided Deep Unsupervised Inversion for 1D Magnetotelluric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy and white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface structure characterization and potential reservoir identification. The Magnetotelluric (MT) method is crucial for these tasks, providing critical information on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative algorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple parameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve proper cost function minimization. Recent advances have incorporated deep learning algorithms for MT inversion, primarily based on supervised learning, and large labeled datasets are needed for training. This work utilizes TensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of solving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform, this paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by physics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed data and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a differentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function minimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data. Therefore, the optimization algorithm updates the network weights to minimize the data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at different acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models obtained are more accurate than those calculated using other techniques.</description>

Abstract: With the expansion of silicon photonics from datacom applications into emerging fields like optical I/O, quantum and programmable photonics there is an increasing demand for devices that combine ultra-compact footprints, low losses, and broad bandwidths. While inverse design techniques have proven very efficient in achieving small footprints, they often underutilize physical insight and rely on large parameter spaces that are challenging to explore, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting devices. Here we present a design methodology that combines inverse design with a topology based on cells, each of which contains a subwavelength metamaterial. This approach significantly reduces the parameter space, while the inherent anisotropy of the subwavelength structures yields shorter devices. We experimentally demonstrate our technique with an ultra-compact spot size converter that achieves a x24 expansion ratio times (from 0.5 um to 12 um) over a length of only 7 um, with insertion losses of 0.8 dB across a measured bandwidth of 160 nm (up to 300 nm in simulation), surpassing the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.</description>
