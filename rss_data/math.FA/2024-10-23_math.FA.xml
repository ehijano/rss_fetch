      <title>A stronger form of Yamamoto's theorem II -- Spectral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $A \in M_m(\mathbb{C})$, Yamamoto's generalization of the spectral radius formula (1967) asserts that $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_j(A^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$ is equal to the $j^{\textrm{th}}$-largest eigenvalue-modulus of $A$, where $s_j (A^n)$ denotes the $j^{\textrm{th}}$-largest singular value of $A^n$. Let $\mathscr{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space, and for an operator $T \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, let $|T| := (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}}$. For $A$ in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, we refer to the sequence, $\{ |A^n|^{\frac{1}{n}} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$, as the $\textit{normalized power sequence}$ of $A$. As our main result, we prove a spatial form of Yamamoto's theorem which asserts that the normalized power sequence of a spectral operator in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$ converges in norm, and provide an explicit description of the limit in terms of its idempotent-valued spectral resolution. Our approach substantially generalizes the corresponding result by the first-named author in the case of matrices in $M_m(\mathbb{C})$, and supplements the Haagerup-Schultz theorem on SOT-convergence of the normalized power sequence of an operator in a $II_1$ factor.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decompositions of integral operators and the Fredholm determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a popular way of decomposing positive definite matrices; in particular it leads to a simple formula for computing the determinant. We present and proof an equivalent formula for computing the Fredholm determinant of a positive definite integral operator on $L^2 [0, 1]$.</description>

      <title>ReLU neural network approximation to piecewise constant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the approximation property of ReLU neural networks (NNs) to piecewise constant functions with unknown interfaces in bounded regions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under the assumption that the discontinuity interface $\Gamma$ may be approximated by a connected series of hyperplanes with a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we show that a three-layer ReLU NN is sufficient to accurately approximate any piecewise constant function and establish its error bound. Moreover, if the discontinuity interface is convex, an analytical formula of the ReLU NN approximation with exact weights and biases is provided.</description>

      <title>Factorisation of symmetric matrices and applications in gravitational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of $2 \times 2$ symmetric matrices $\mathcal M$ with respect to a contour $\Gamma$. For the case that the quotient $q$ of the two diagonal elements of $\mathcal M$ is a rational function, we show that due to the symmetric nature of the matrix $\mathcal M$, the second column in each of the two matrix factors that arise in the factorisation is determined in terms of the first column in each of these matrix factors, by multiplication by a rational matrix, and we give a method for determining the second columns of these factors. We illustrate our method with two examples in the context of a Riemann-Hilbert approach to obtaining solutions to the Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Norm of the Hilbert matrix operator between some spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the exact value of the norm of the Hilbert matrix operator $\mathcal{H}$ from the logarithmically weighted Korenblum space $H^\infty_{\alpha,\log}$ into Korenblum space $H^\infty_\alpha$, and from the Hardy space $H^\infty$ to the classical Bloch space $\mathcal{B}$. Furthermore, we compute the precise value of the norm on the logarithmically weighted Korenblum space $H^\infty_{\alpha,\log}$, and obtain both the lower and upper bounds of the norm on $\alpha$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$. Finally, in the context of mapping from the Korenblum space $H^\infty_\alpha$ to the $(\alpha+1)$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha+1}$, we establish the norm of $\mathcal{H}$.</description>

      <title>Approximations of Lipschitz maps with maximal derivatives on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two types of approximations of Lipschitz maps with derivatives of maximal slopes on Banach spaces. First, we characterize the Radon-Nikod\'ym property in terms of strongly norm attaining Lipschitz maps and maximal derivative attaining Lipschitz maps, which complements the characterization presented in \cite{CCM}. It is shown in particular that if every Lipschitz map can be approximated by those that either strongly attain their norm or attain their maximal derivative for every renorming of the range space, then the range space must have the Radon-Nikod\'ym property. Next, we prove that every Lipschitz functional defined on the real line can be locally approximated by maximal affine functions, while such an approximation cannot be guaranteed in the context of uniform approximation. This extends the previous work in \cite{BJLPS} in view of maximal affine functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $p&gt;1$ every subspace of $\ell_p(\Gamma)$ is an $\ell_p$-sum of separable subspaces of $\ell_p$, and we provide examples of subspaces of $\ell_p(\Gamma)$ for $0&lt;p\leq 1$ that are not even isomorphic to any $\ell_p$-sum of separable spaces, notably the kernel of any quotient map $\ell_p(\Gamma)\to L_1(2^{\Gamma})$ with $\Gamma$ uncountable. We involve the separable complementation property (SCP) and the separable extension property (SEP), showing that if $X$ is a Banach space of density character $\aleph_1$ with the SCP then the kernel of any quotient map $\ell_p(\Gamma)\to X$ is a complemented subspace of a space with the SCP and, consequently, has the SEP.</description>

      <title>The isomorphism problem for analytic discs with self-crossings on the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $V$ is the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ embedded in the $d$-dimensional unit ball $\mathbb{B}_d$ and attached to the unit sphere. Consider the space $\mathcal{H}_V$, the restriction of the Drury-Arveson space to the variety $V$, and its multiplier algebra $\mathcal{M}_V = \operatorname{Mult}(\mathcal{H}_V)$. The isomorphism problem is the following: Is $V_1 \cong V_2$ equivalent to $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$?
  A theorem of Alpay, Putinar and Vinnikov states that for $V$ without self-crossings on the boundary $\mathcal{M}_V$ is the space of bounded analytic functions on $V$. We consider what happens when there are self-crossings on the boundary and prove that if $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ algebraically, then $V_1$ and $V_2$ must have the same self-crossings up to a unit disc automorphism. We prove that an isomorphism between $\mathcal{M}_{V_1}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ can only be given by a composition with a map from $V_1$ to $V_2$. In the case of a single simple self-crossing we show that there are only two possible candidates for this map and find these candidates. Finally, we provide a continuum of $V$'s with the same self-crossing pattern such that their multiplier algebras are all mutually non-isomorphic.</description>

Abstract: It is proved that: each collectively order continuous set of operators from an Archimedean ordered vector space to an ordered vector space is collectively order bounded; each collectively order to norm bounded set of operators from an ordered Banach space with a closed generating cone to a normed space is norm bounded; collectively r-continuous sets agree with collectively order bounded ones when the space in the range has a generating cone. Several applications to operator semigroups are given.</description>

      <title>Coamenability and cospectral radius for orbit equivalence relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inclusions $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$ of discrete, probability measure-preserving orbit equivalence relations. In previous work with Ab\'{e}rt-Fra\c{c}zyk, we established the pointwise almost sure existence of the cospectral radius of a random walk on the $\mathcal{R}$-classes. In this paper, we investigate the connections of this cospectral radius to the coamenability of the inclusion $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$. We also undertake a systematic study of coamenability for inclusions of relations, establishing several equivalence formulations of this notion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result that, if a maximal symmetric operator $T$ in a Krein space $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^-[\oplus]\mathcal{H}^+$ has the property $\mathcal{H}^-\subseteq\mathcal{D}_T$, then the imaginary part of its eigenvalue $\lambda$ from upper or lower half-plane is bounded by $\lvert \mathrm{Im}\,\lambda\rvert\leq2\lVert TP^- \rVert$. We prove that in both half-planes $\lvert \mathrm{Im}\,\lambda\rvert$ never exceeds $t_0\lVert TP^- \rVert$ for some constant $t_0\approx1.84$. The result applies to a closed symmetric relation $T$ and carries on a suitable, most notably dissipative, extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17128v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for exploring generalization errors of transfer learning through the lens of differential calculus on the space of probability measures. In particular, we consider two main transfer learning scenarios, $\alpha$-ERM and fine-tuning with the KL-regularized empirical risk minimization and establish generic conditions under which the generalization error and the population risk convergence rates for these scenarios are studied. Based on our theoretical results, we show the benefits of transfer learning with a one-hidden-layer neural network in the mean-field regime under some suitable integrability and regularity assumptions on the loss and activation functions.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Means in Infinite Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there exists a well-developed asymptotic theory of Fr\'echet means of random variables taking values in a general "finite-dimensional" metric space, there are only a few known results in which the random variables can take values in an "infinite-dimensional" metric space. Presently, show that a natural setting for the study of probabilistic aspects of Fr\'echet means is that of metric spaces which admit a suitably powerful notion of "weak convergence". This allows us to recover, strengthen, and generalize virtually all known asymptotic theory for Fr\'echet means; in particular, we expand the possible geometric settings where such theorems can be applied, we reduce the moment assumptions to the provably minimal possible, and we completely remove assumption about uniqueness of the Fr\'echet mean. We also analyze many examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMNM property for commutative Banach algebras is a form of Ulam stability for multiplicative linear functionals. We show that on any semilattice of infinite breadth, one may construct a weight for which the resulting weighted convolution algebra fails to have the AMNM property. Our work is the culmination of a trilogy started in [Semigroup Forum 102 (2021), no. 1, 86-103] and continued in [European J. Combin. 94 (2021), article 103311]. In particular, we obtain a refinement of the main result of the second paper, by establishing a dichotomy for union-closed set systems that has a Ramsey-theoretic flavour.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory of polynomials and linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey revolves around the question how the roots of a monic polynomial (resp. the spectral decomposition of a linear operator), whose coefficients depend in a smooth way on parameters, depend on those parameters. The parameter dependence of the polynomials (resp. operators) ranges from real analytic over $C^\infty$ to differentiable of finite order with often drastically different regularity results for the roots (resp. eigenvalues and eigenvectors). Another interesting point is the difference between the perturbation theory of hyperbolic polynomials (where, by definition, all roots are real) and that of general complex polynomials. The subject, which started with Rellich's work in the 1930s, enjoyed sustained interest through time that intensified in the last two decades, bringing some definitive optimal results. Throughout we try to explain the main proof ideas; Rellich's theorem and Bronshtein's theorem on hyperbolic polynomials are presented with full proofs. The survey is written for readers interested in singularity theory but also for those who intend to apply the results in other fields.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we showed that for suitable $(\beta,p, s,\ell)$ the $\beta$-order fractional derivative with respect to the last coordinate of the Fourier transform of an $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function is in $H^{-s}$ after restricting to a graph of a function with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature provided that the restriction of the Fourier transform of such function to the surface is in $H^{\ell}$. This is a generalization of the result in \cite{GoldStol}*{Theorem 1.12}.</description>

Abstract: This article deals with functions with a prefixed range and their inclusion in Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. This idea was originally introduced by Hansen for Hardy spaces, and it was recently taken into weighted Bergman spaces by Karafyllia and Karamanlis. In particular, we improve a theorem of Karafyllia showing that the Hardy and Bergman numbers of any given domain coincide, that is, the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces to which a function with prefixed range belongs can be related. The main tools in the proofs are the Green function of the domain and its universal covering map.</description>

Abstract: We establish that the Lavrentiev gap between Sobolev and Lipschitz maps does not occur for a scalar variational problem of the form: \[ \textrm{to minimize} \qquad u \mapsto \int_\Omega f(x,u,\nabla u)\text{d}x \,, \] under a Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz open set in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 1$ and the function $f$ is required to be measurable with respect to the spacial variable, continuous with respect to the second one, and continuous and comparable to convex with respect to the last variable. Moreover, we assume that $f$ satisfies a natural condition balancing the variations with respect to the first variable and the growth with respect to the last one. Remarkably, typical conditions that are usually imposed on $f$ to discard the Lavrentiev gap are dropped here: we do not require $f$ to be bounded or convex with respect to the second variable, nor impose any condition of $\Delta_2$-kind with respect to the last variable.</description>
