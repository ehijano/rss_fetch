      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Granular Chains with Modern Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Externally driven dense packings of particles can exhibit nonlinear wave phenomena that are not described by effective medium theory or linearized approximate models. Such nontrivial wave responses can be exploited to design sound-focusing/scrambling devices, acoustic filters, and analog computational units. At high amplitude vibrations or low confinement pressures, the effect of nonlinear particle contacts becomes increasingly noticeable, and the interplay of nonlinearity, disorder, and discreteness in the system gives rise to remarkable properties, particularly useful in designing structures with exotic properties. In this paper, we build upon the data-driven methods in dynamical system analysis and show that the Koopman spectral theory can be applied to granular crystals, enabling their phase space analysis beyond the linearizable regime and without recourse to any approximations considered in the previous works. We show that a deep neural network can map the dynamics to a latent space where the essential nonlinearity of the granular system unfolds into a high-dimensional linear space. As a proof of concept, we use data from numerical simulations of a two-particle system and evaluate the accuracy of the trajectory predictions under various initial conditions. By incorporating data from experimental measurements, our proposed framework can directly capture the underlying dynamics without imposing any assumptions about the physics model. Spectral analysis of the trained surrogate system can help bridge the gap between the simulation results and the physical realization of granular crystals and facilitate the inverse design of materials with desired behaviors.</description>

      <title>Feedback between microscopic activity and macroscopic dynamics drives excitability and oscillations in mechanochemical matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic behaviour of active matter arises from nonequilibrium microscopic processes. In soft materials, active stresses typically drive macroscopic shape changes, which in turn alter the geometry constraining the microscopic dynamics, leading to complex feedback effects. Although such mechanochemical coupling is common in living matter and associated with biological functions such as cell migration, division, and differentiation, the underlying principles are not well understood due to a lack of minimal models that bridge the scales from the microscopic biochemical processes to the macroscopic shape dynamics. To address this gap, we derive tractable coarse-grained equations from microscopic dynamics for a class of mechanochemical systems, in which biochemical signal processing is coupled to shape dynamics. Specifically, we consider molecular interactions at the surface of biological cells that commonly drive cell-cell signaling and adhesion, and obtain a macroscopic description of cells as signal-processing droplets that adaptively change their interfacial tensions. We find a rich phenomenology, including multistability, symmetry-breaking, excitability, and self-sustained shape oscillations, with the underlying critical points revealing universal characteristics of such systems. Our tractable framework provides a paradigm for how soft active materials respond to shape-dependent signals, and suggests novel modes of self-organisation at the collective scale. These are explored further in our companion paper [arxiv 2402.08664v3].</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Healthcare Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare materials, whether they are natural or synthetic, are complex structures made up of simpler materials. Because of their intricate structure, composite materials are ideal for prosthetics because it is possible to tune their structure to get mechanical properties that are compatible with bone, thus encouraging biointegration. To be effective, implants must be properly suited to the host, which necessitates complete control over both the design of the implants as well as their evolution over time as they are used. In the case of composite implants, this means that, while material control at the macroscopic scale is required during implant shaping, the quality of the interface, which is determined by phenomena acting at the nanoscale, is also required. In this work, we show that such an issue can be resolved by resorting to a multi-scale approach and that, in this context, numerical modeling is a useful tool. Then we describe the principle of the process for investigating composite biomaterials using numerical modeling. Then, we give a concrete example of the protocol by talking about the first step of the ''grafting from'' method that Professors H. Palkowski and A. Carrado's teams came up with to make implants from hybrid biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Intermediate scattering function of a gravitactic circle swimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze gravitaxis of a Brownian circle swimmer by deriving and characterizing analytically the experimentally measurable intermediate scattering function (ISF). To solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation we use a spectral-theory approach and find formal expressions in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the overdamped-noisy-driven-pendulum problem. We further perform a Taylor series of the ISF in the wavevector to read off the cumulants up to the fourth order. We focus on the skewness and kurtosis analyzed for four observation directions in the 2D-plane. Validating our findings involves conducting Langevin-dynamics simulations and interpreting the results using a harmonic approximation. The skewness and kurtosis are amplified as the orienting torque approaches the intrinsic angular drift of the circle swimmer from above, highlighting deviations from Gaussian behavior. Transforming the ISF to the comoving frame, again a measurable quantity, reveals gravitactic effects and diverse behaviors spanning from diffusive motion at low wavenumbers to circular motion at intermediate and directed motion at higher wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Pervaporation-driven electrokinetic energy harvesting using poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrokinetic energy harvesting from evaporation-driven flows in porous materials has recently been the subject of numerous studies, particularly with the development of nanomaterials with high conversion efficiencies. The configuration in which the energy conversion element is located upstream of the element which passively drives the evaporative flow has rarely been studied. However, this configuration offers the possibility of increasing the harvested energy simply by increasing the evaporation surface area and/or the hydraulic resistance of the energy conversion element. In this work, we investigate this configuration with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) chips playing the role of {\it artificial leaves} driving a pervaporation-induced flow through a polystyrene colloid plug in a submillimetre tube for the energy conversion. With an appropriate design of the venation of the PDMS leaves, we report the first experimental evidence of electrokinetic energy conversion from pervaporation-induced flows, which increases with the pervaporation area. We also provide new insights by demonstrating that this increase is limited by cavitation within the PDMS leaves, which occurs systematically as soon as the water pressure inside the leaf reaches $P_\text{leaf} \simeq 0$~bar. Whatever the cavitation threshold, this phenomenon imposes an intrinsic limit on this configuration, underlining the need for innovative strategies to improve the harvesting of electrokinetic energy by evaporation.</description>

      <title>Cooperative motion in equilibrium phases across two-dimension melting in pure and disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover the dynamics of particles with Gaussian core interactions across melting in pure and disordered two-dimensional (2D) systems. Intriguing signatures of cooperative motion of particles in string-like paths are found at low temperatures. Such a motion, while common to glasses and supercooled liquids, are realized here in traditional equilibrium phases, including in pure systems. We explore the interplay of such motion and impurities and report their repercussions on spatiotemporal correlations. In particular, cooperative motion seems to cause a departure from the diffusive dynamics, causing slow relaxation.</description>

      <title>Breaking Mechanical Holography in Combinatorial Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response strongly depends on the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. We study a family of possible block types for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Blocks that are centrally symmetric induce holographic order, such that mechanical compatibility (meaning that blocks do not impede each other's motion) implies bulk-boundary coupling. With them, one can design a compatible metamaterial that will deform in any desired texture only on part of its boundary. With blocks that break holographic order, we demonstrate how to design the deformation texture on the entire boundary. Correspondingly, the number of compatible holographic metamaterials scales exponentially with the boundary, while in non-holographic cases we show that it scales exponentially with the bulk.</description>

      <title>Chiral active fluids: what can we learn from the total momentum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are those that break both time-reversal symmetry and parity microscopically, which results in average rotation of the material's complex molecules around their center-of-mass (CM). These materials are far from equilibrium due to their local non-vanishing spin angular momentum. In this paper we show that, unlike passive fluids, the non vanishing spin angular momentum brings about a difference between the CM momentum and the total momentum, which accounts for the momentum of all atoms that compose the complex rotating molecules. This is in stark contrast to equilibrium fluids where the CM stress and the total momentum are essentially equivalent. In fact, we find that generally the CM dynamics are insufficient to describe the dynamics of a chiral active material. The total momentum, other than being experimentally accessible in simple rheological experiments, also imposes another constraint -- its stress must be allowed to be written in a symmetric way. We find that the latter imposes a relation between possible central-force interactions and spin-spin interactions, and constraints the ammount of {\it odd} viscosities in the system to the well-known odd (Hall) viscosity and the odd pressure.</description>

      <title>ActiveCheerios: 3D-Printed Marangoni-Driven Active Particles at an Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marangoni surfers are simple, cost-effective tabletop experiments that, despite their simplicity, exhibit rich dynamics and collective behaviors driven by physicochemical mechanisms, hydrodynamic interactions, and inertial motion. This work introduces self-propelled particles designed and manufactured through 3D printing to move on the air-water interface. We develop particles with tunable motility and controlled particle-particle interactions by leveraging surface tension-mediated forces, such as the Marangoni effect for propulsion and the Cheerios effect for interactions. Rapid prototyping through 3D printing facilitates the exploration of a wide design space, enabling precise control over particle shape and function. We exemplify this by creating translational and chiral particles. Additionally, we investigate self-assembly in this system and highlight its potential for modular designs where mechanically linked particles with varying characteristics follow outlined trajectories. This research offers a flexible, low-cost approach to designing active interfacial systems and opens new possibilities for further advancements of adaptive, multifunctional devices.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale simulation model for odd fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fluid, with broken time-reversal symmetry, would exhibit odd transport coefficients, such as odd viscosity, thermal conductivity and diffusion coefficient, which may fundamentally alter the fluid properties and significantly influence the structure and dynamics of immersed objects. Here, we develop an efficient coarse-grained simulation approach for the odd fluid, that captures all essential features of real odd fluids. Based on microscopic kinetic theory, we analytically derive the transport coefficients of the mesoscale odd fluid. Furthermore, we validate our approach by performing both simulations and theoretical calculations to explore the intricate transport phenomena of the odd fluid under various external drivings. Our work thus paves the way for studying anomalous transport in odd fluids and for large-scale simulations of odd complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Internal motion of soft granular particles under circular shearing: Rate-dependent quaking and its spatial structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16293v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tightly packed granular particles under shear often exhibit intriguing intermittencies, specifically, sudden stress drops that we refer to as quaking. To probe the nature of this phenomenon, we prototype a circular shear cell that is capable of imposing a uniform and unlimited shear strain under quasi-static cyclic driving. Spherical PDMS(polydimethylsiloxane) particles, immersed in fluid, are driven in a fixed total volume at a wide range of shear rates, with particle trajectories captured in 3D space via refraction-index-matched fluorescent tomography. Statistics on the magnitude of fluctuating displacements of individual particles shows distinct dependence on the shear rate. Particle motions are smooth at high shear rates. At intermediate shear rates, quaking emerges with clusters of particles exhibiting relatively large displacements. At low shear rates, a cluster can span the entire system. and the cluster exhibits substructures in view of localized particle movements. Overall, we have confirmed that the quaking phenomena in the current setup are consistent with our previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett.,126, 128001 (2021)], and that the dimensionless shear rate that we have proposed is indeed a good parameter for unifying the transitions observed in different experimental geometries.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear elastic deformation of liquid inclusions embedded in elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastomers filled with liquid inclusions -- as opposed to conventional solid fillers -- are a recent trend in the soft matter community because of their unique range of mechanical and physical properties. Such properties stem, in part, from the very large deformations that the underlying liquid inclusions are capable of undergoing. With the objective of advancing the understanding of the mechanics of this emerging class of materials, this paper presents a combined experimental/theoretical study of the nonlinear elastic deformation of initially spherical liquid inclusions embedded in elastomers that are subjected to quasistatic mechanical loads. The focus is on two fundamental problems, both within the limit regime when elasto-capillarity effects are negligible: ($i$) the problem of an isolated inclusion and ($ii$) that of a pair of closely interacting inclusions. Experimentally, specimens made of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer filled with either isolated or pairs of initially spherical liquid glycerol inclusions are subjected to uniaxial tension. For the specimens with pairs of inclusions, three orientations of the two inclusions with respect to the direction of the applied macroscopic tensile load are considered, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. The liquid glycerol is stained with a fluorescent dye that permits to measure the local deformation of the inclusions \emph{in situ} via confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscopy. Theoretically, a recently developed framework -- wherein the elastomer is considered to be a nonlinear elastic solid, the liquid comprising the inclusions is considered to be a nonlinear elastic fluid, and the interfaces separating the elastomer from the liquid inclusions can feature their own nonlinear elastic behavior (e.g., surface tension) -- is utilized to carry out full-field simulations of the experiments.</description>

      <title>Mixing small proteins with lipids and cholesterol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many ternary mixtures composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids with cholesterol (Chol) exhibit a region of coexistence between liquid-disordered $(L_d)$ and liquid-ordered $(L_o)$ domains, bearing some similarities to lipid rafts in biological membranes. However, biological rafts also contain many proteins that interact with the lipids and modify the distribution of lipids. Here, we extend a previously published lattice model of ternary DPPC/DOPC/Chol mixtures by introducing a small amount of small proteins (peptides). We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the mixing phase behavior of the components as a function of the interaction parameter representing the affinity between the proteins and the saturated DPPC chains, and for different mixture compositions. At moderate fractions of DPPC, the system is in a two-phase $L_d+L_o$ coexistence, and the proteins exhibit a simple partition behavior between the phases that depends on the protein-lipid affinity parameter. At low DPPC compositions, the mixture is in $L_d$ phase with local nanoscopic ordered domains. Addition of proteins with sufficiently strong attraction to the saturated lipids can induce the separation of a distinct $L_o$ large domain with tightly-packed gel-like clusters of proteins and saturated lipids. Consistent with the theory of phase transitions, we observe that the domain sizes grow when the mixture composition is in the vicinity of the critical point. Our simulations show that the addition of a small amount of proteins to such mixtures can cause their size to grow even further, and lead to the formation of metastable dynamic $L_o$ domains with sizes comparable to biological rafts.</description>

      <title>Novel Cisplatin-Magnetoliposome Complex Shows Enhanced Antitumor Activity via Hyperthermia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several methods to improve cancer patient survival rates by inducing hyperthermia in tumor tissues, which involves raising their temperature above 41{\deg}C. These methods utilize different energy sources to deliver heat to the target region, including light, microwaves or radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. We have developed a new, magnetically responsive nanocarrier, consisting of liposomes loaded with magnetic nanoparticles and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), commonly known as Cisplatin. The resulting magnetoliposome (ML) is rapidly internalized by lung and pancreas tumor cell lines, stored in intracellular vesicles, and capable of inducing hyperthermia under magnetic fields. The ML has no significant toxicity both in vitro and in vivo and, most importantly, enhances cell death by apoptosis after magnetic hyperthermia. Remarkably, mice bearing induced lung tumors, treated with CDDP-loaded nanocarriers and subjected to an applied electromagnetic field, showed an improved survival rate over those treated with either soluble CDDP or hyperthermia alone. Therefore, our approach of magnetic hyperthermia plus CDDP-ML significantly enhances in vitro cell death and in vivo survival of treated animals.</description>

      <title>Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>

      <title>Stokes flow of incompressible liquid through a conical diffuser with partial slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An alternative form of the general solution of the linearized stationary Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in spherical coordinates is obtained by the vector potential method. A previously published solution to this problem, dating back to the paper by Sampson, is given in terms of a stream function, which leads to formulas that are difficult to apply in practice. The presented form of solution is applied to the problem of liquid flowing through a conical diffuser under a partial slip boundary condition for a certain slip length lambda. Recurrent relations are obtained that allow us to determine the velocity, pressure and stream function. The solution is analyzed in the first order of decomposition with respect to a small dimensionless parameter (lambda divided by r). It is shown that the sliding of the liquid over the surface of the cone leads to a vorticity of the flow. At zero slip length, we obtain the well-known solution to the problem of a diffuser with no-slip boundary condition that correspond to strictly radial streamlines.</description>

      <title>Steerable dual-trap optical tweezers with confocal position detection using back-scattered light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers has emerged as a powerful tool in manipulating microscopic particles and in measuring weak forces of the order of a pico-Newton. As a result, it has found wide applications ranging from material science to biology. Dual-trap optical tweezers (DTOT) are of particular importance as they allow for two point correlation measurements as in molecular force spectroscopy, two-point active micro-rheology, etc. Here we report a novel design for a steerable DTOT setup which uses back-scattered light from the two traps for position detection. This is performed using a confocal scheme where the two detectors are placed at the conjugate points to the respective traps. This offers several significant advantages over current designs, such as, zero cross-talk between signals, single module assembly and robustness to thermal drift. Moreover, our design can be very easily integrated with standard microscopy techniques like Phase contrast and Differential Interference Contrast, without modifying the microscope illumination unit.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase transition.We further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately constant.This constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</description>

      <title>On the shape of air bubbles trapped in ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water usually contains dissolved gases, and because freezing is a purifying process these gases must be expelled for ice to form. Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are then trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A non-linear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, which features two non-dimensional numbers representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate, and two additional parameters representing simultaneous freezing and nucleation treated as the initial condition. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of these bubbles have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation, and that most bubbles can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This method enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical ``ice worms'', well known to glaciologists.</description>

      <title>Active doping controls the mode of failure in dense colloidal gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical properties of disordered materials are governed by their underlying free energy landscape. In contrast to external fields, embedding a small fraction of active particles within a disordered material generates non-equilibrium internal fields, which can help to circumvent kinetic barriers and modulate the free energy landscape. In this work, we investigate through computer simulations how the activity of active particles alters the mechanical response of deeply annealed polydisperse colloidal gels. We show that the 'swim force' generated by the embedded active particles is responsible for determining the mode of mechanical failure, i.e., brittle vs. ductile. We find, and theoretically justify, that at a critical swim force the mechanical properties of the gel decrease abruptly, signaling a change in the mode of mechanical failure. The weakening of the elastic modulus above the critical swim force results from the change in gel porosity and distribution of attractive forces among gel particles. Below the critical swim force, the ductility enhancement is caused by an increase of gel structural disorder. Above the critical swim force, the gel develops a pronounced heterogeneous structure characterized by multiple pore spaces, and the mechanical response is controlled by dynamical heterogeneities. We contrast these results with those of a simulated monodisperse gel that exhibits a non-monotonic trend of ductility modulation with increasing swim force, revealing a complex interplay between the gel energy landscape and embedded activity.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the interfacial free energy along the coexistence line from single-state calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculation of the interfacial free energy between two thermodynamic phases is crucial across various fields, including materials science, chemistry, and condensed matter physics. In this study, we apply an existing thermodynamic approach, the Gibbs-Cahn integration method, to determine the interfacial free energy under different coexistence conditions, relying on data from a single-state calculation at specified pressure and temperature. This approach developed by Laird et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 131, 114110 (2009)] reduces computational demand and enhances efficiency compared to methods that require separate measurements at each thermodynamic state. The integration scheme computes the excess interfacial free energy using unbiased NVT simulations, where the two phases coexist, to provide input for the calculations. We apply this method to the Lennard-Jones and mW water models for liquid-solid interfaces, as well as the Lennard-Jones and TIP4P/2005 models for liquid-vapor interfaces. Our results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of this integration route for estimating the interfacial free energy along a coexistence line.</description>

      <title>Why hyperdensity functionals describe any equilibrium observable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recent hyperdensity functional theory for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of soft matter systems [F. Samm\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.098201]. Hyperdensity functionals give access to the behaviour of arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. The approach is based on classical density functional theory applied to an extended ensemble using standard functional techniques. The associated formally exact generalized Mermin-Evans functional relationships can be represented accurately by neural functionals. These neural networks are trained via simulation-based supervised machine learning and they allow one to carry out efficient functional calculus using automatic differentiation and numerical functional line integration. Exact sum rules, including hard wall contact theorems and hyperfluctuation Ornstein-Zernike equations, interrelate the different correlation functions. We lay out close connections to hyperforce correlation sum rules [S. Robitschko et al., Commun. Phys. 7, 103 (2024); 10.1038/s42005-024-01568-y] that arise from statistical mechanical gauge invariance [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 217101 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.217101]. Further quantitative measures of collective self-organization are provided by hyperdirect correlation functionals and spatially resolved hyperfluctuation profiles. The theory facilitates to gain deep insight into the inherent structuring mechanisms that govern the behaviour of both simple and complex order parameters in coupled many-body systems.</description>

      <title>On modeling fracture of soft polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft polymers are ubiquitous materials in nature and as engineering materials with properties varying from rate-independent to rate-dependent depending on the crosslinking mechanisms. Current fracture toughness measures are non-unique for rate-dependent soft materials for varying loading profiles and specimen geometries. Works on modeling fracture in rate-dependent soft polymers are limited to specific pre-cracked geometries. There is no generally agreed-upon model for the fracture of soft polymers. We propose and show that a critical value of stress work $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ obtained from simple homogeneous deformation experiments can be a scalar measure of fracture resistance in soft polymers. We also develop a damage model to predict fracture in soft polymers through a generalized gradient damage framework. The energetic part of $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ is proposed as a damage initiation criterion. The fracture model is demonstrated to work well for both elastomers and viscous soft polymers by comparing model predictions against experimental results for different materials (ethylene propylene diene monomer - EPDM, EPS25 vitrimer, polyborosiloxane), a variety of specimen geometries, and loading conditions. The model is able to predict key physical phenomena and microstructural physical quantities, such as subchain dissociation energy during the fracture of soft polymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider the fluid-mediated approach of a deformable elastic object (``indenter'') to a rigid surface at relatively low velocity. As a fluid is squeezed between the tip and the rigid substrate, lubrication pressures develop, which in turn deform the indenter leading edge. I study the influence of the tip geometry over the lubrication pressure distribution. ''Low velocity'' means that the approach happens slowly enough for the body to adapt quasi-statically to the transient viscous pressures triggered in the mediating fluid when squeezed. The salient geometrical simplification is that the indenter shape is axisymmetric, and its height profile goes like $\sim r^n$, $r$ being the radial coordinate measured from the tip and $n$ the exponent that controls the leading edge shape. I inquire if the distribution of pressures induced by the thin lubrication film forming before touchdown corresponds to the pressure distribution predicted by an equivalent ''dry'' contact mechanics problem. Results show striking resemblance for $n \le 2$ while also partial ability to predict the pressure distribution for $n&gt;2$. Still, the analogy is deemed exceedingly insightful.</description>

      <title>Transport of molecules via polymerization in chemical gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of molecules for chemical reactions is critically important in various cellular biological processes. Despite thermal diffusion being prevalent in many biochemical processes, it is unreliable for any sort of directed transport or preferential accumulation of molecules. In this paper we propose a strategy for directed motion in which the molecules are transported by active carriers via polymerization. This transport is facilitated by chemical/activity gradients which generate an effective drift of the polymers. By marginalizing out the active degrees of freedom of the system, we obtain an effective Fokker-Planck equation for the Rouse modes of such active-passive hybrid polymers. In particular, we solve for the steady state distribution of the center of mass and its mean first passage time to reach an intended destination. We focus on how the arrangement of active units within the polymer affect its steady-state and dynamic behaviour and how they can be optimized to achieve high accumulation or rapid motility.</description>

      <title>Kinetic model for transport in granular mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different non-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the relaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the kinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently adapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass, momentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third nonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform shear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are computed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the transport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are also explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its theoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results and computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the comparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations. While the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the Boltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the case of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate dependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with increasing inelasticity in collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of jellyfish swarm formation and exemplify it with simulations of active Brownian particles. The motivation for our analysis is the phenomenon of jellyfish blooms in the ocean and clustering of jellyfish in tank experiments. We argue that such clusters emerge due to an externally induced phase transition of jellyfish density, such as convergent flows, which is then maintained and amplified by self-induced stimuli. Our study introduces three mechanisms relevant for a better understanding of jellyfish blooming that have not been taken into account before which are a signaling tracer, jellyfish-wall interaction and ignorance of external stimuli. Our results agree with the biological fact that jellyfish exhibit an extreme sensitivity to stimuli in order to achieve favorable aggregations. Based on our theoretical framework, we are able to provide a clear terminology for future experimental analysis of jellyfish swarming and we pinpoint potential limitations of tank experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>
