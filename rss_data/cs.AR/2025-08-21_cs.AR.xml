      <title>Accelerating GenAI Workloads by Enabling RISC-V Microkernel Support in IREE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project enables RISC-V microkernel support in IREE, an MLIR-based machine learning compiler and runtime. The approach begins by enabling the lowering of MLIR linalg dialect contraction ops to linalg.mmt4d op for the RISC-V64 target within the IREE pass pipeline, followed by the development of optimized microkernels for RISC-V. The performance gains are compared with upstream IREE and Llama.cpp for the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model.</description>

      <title>Improving Chip Design Enablement for Universities in Europe -- A Position Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry is pivotal to Europe's economy, especially within the industrial and automotive sectors. However, Europe faces a significant shortfall in chip design capabilities, marked by a severe skilled labor shortage and lagging contributions in the design value chain segment. This paper explores the role of European universities and academic initiatives in enhancing chip design education and research to address these deficits. We provide a comprehensive overview of current European chip design initiatives, analyze major challenges in recruitment, productivity, technology access, and design enablement, and identify strategic opportunities to strengthen chip design capabilities within academic institutions. Our analysis leads to a series of recommendations that highlight the need for coordinated efforts and strategic investments to overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <title>Row-Column Hybrid Grouping for Fault-Resilient Multi-Bit Weight Representation on IMC Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation. Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Quantized Neural Networks for Microcontrollers: A Comprehensive Review of Methods, Platforms, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers, has introduced significant challenges in balancing model performance, computational complexity and memory constraints. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) addresses these issues by integrating advancements across machine learning algorithms, hardware acceleration, and software optimization to efficiently run deep neural networks on embedded systems. This survey presents a hardware-centric introduction to quantization, systematically reviewing essential quantization techniques employed to accelerate deep learning models for embedded applications. In particular, further emphasis is put on critical trade-offs among model performance and hardware capabilities. The survey further evaluates existing software frameworks and hardware platforms designed specifically for supporting QNN execution on microcontrollers. Moreover, we provide an analysis of the current challenges and an outline of promising future directions in the rapidly evolving domain of QNN deployment.</description>

      <title>JEDI-linear: Fast and Efficient Graph Neural Networks for Jet Tagging on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptable High-throughput Streaming Aggregation Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aggregation queries are a series of computationally-demanding analytics operations on counted, grouped or time series data. They include tasks such as summation or finding the median among the items of the same group, and within a specified number of the last observed tuples for sliding window aggregation (SWAG). They have a wide range of applications including database analytics, operating systems, bank security and medical sensors. Existing challenges include the hardware complexity that comes with efficiently handling per-group states using hash-based approaches. This paper presents an adaptable pipeline for calculating a wide range of aggregation queries with high throughput. It is then adapted for SWAG and achieves up to 476x speedup over the CPU core of the same platform. It achieves unparalleled levels of performance and functionality such as a throughput of 1 GT/s on our setup for SWAG without groups, and more advanced operators with up to 4x the window sizes than the state-of-the-art with groups as an approximation for SWAG featuring per-group windows using a fraction of the resources and no DRAM.</description>

      <title>CEO-DC: Driving Decarbonization in HPC Data Centers with Actionable Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data centers is increasing energy demand and widening the carbon gap in the ICT sector, as fossil fuels still dominate global energy production. Addressing this challenge requires collaboration across research, policy, and industry to rethink how computing infrastructures are designed and scaled sustainably. This work addresses central trade-offs in procurement decisions that affect carbon emissions, economic costs, and scaling of compute resources. We present these factors in a holistic decision-making framework for Carbon and Economy Optimization in Data Centers (CEO-DC). CEO-DC introduces new carbon and price metrics that enable DC managers, platform designers, and policymakers to make informed decisions. Applying CEO-DC to current trends in AI and HPC reveals that, in 72% of the cases, platform improvements lag behind demand growth. Moreover, prioritizing energy efficiency over latency can reduce the economic appeal of sustainable designs. Our analysis shows that in many countries with electricity with medium to high carbon intensity, replacing platforms older than four years could reduce their projected emissions by at least 75%. However, current carbon incentives worldwide remain insufficient to steer data center procurement strategies toward sustainable goals. In summary, our findings underscore the need for a shift in hardware design and faster grid decarbonization to ensure sustainability and technological viability.</description>

      <title>Silent Data Corruption by 10x Test Escapes Threatens Reliable Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Too many defective compute chips are escaping existing manufacturing tests -- at least an order of magnitude more than industrial targets across all compute chip types in data centers. Silent data corruptions (SDCs) caused by test escapes, when left unaddressed, pose a major threat to reliable computing. We present a three-pronged approach outlining future directions for overcoming test escapes: (a) Quick diagnosis of defective chips directly from system-level incorrect behaviors. Such diagnosis is critical for gaining insights into why so many defective chips escape existing manufacturing testing. (b) In-field detection of defective chips. (c) New test experiments to understand the effectiveness of new techniques for detecting defective chips. These experiments must overcome the drawbacks and pitfalls of previous industrial test experiments and case studies.</description>

      <title>Power Stabilization for AI Training Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged approach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested using a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power simulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions under real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>SecFSM: Knowledge Graph-Guided Verilog Code Generation for Secure Finite State Machines in Systems-on-Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control logic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and time-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating Verilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for security-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs. Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets, artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, on a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM achieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.</description>
