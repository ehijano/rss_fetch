      <title>Notes from the Physics Teaching Lab: Optical Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a series of experiments done using a commercially available optical pumping apparatus that is currently being used in physics teaching labs at over one hundred universities. Our focus here is to provide an extensive and detailed examination of the capabilities of this instrument, including numerous examples of extensive measurements and data analysis, presented as a supplement to the manufacturers user manual. Our hope is that instructors using this or similar optical pumping instruments will find the experiments described here useful for designing and implementing the curricula in their own physics teaching labs.</description>

      <title>Student sensemaking on electrostatics problems involving the method of images through the lens of epistemic game framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of student sensemaking while navigating the physics problem-solving process can play an important role in developing approaches to helping students become proficient problem solvers. Since most prior studies on student sensemaking in physics have focused on introductory physics, this study sheds light on a relatively unexplored research area involving the sensemaking of advanced physics students. We conducted individual interviews with graduate students to investigate their sensemaking while solving upper-level undergraduate electrostatics problems in the context of the method of images. Analysis through the lens of the epistemic game framework proposed by Tuminaro and Redish shows that the central part of student sensemaking can be mapped on to the Pictorial Analysis game with other epistemic games also playing a role, but the ontological components of some games require refinement. The study involves an in-depth comparison of sensemaking on related but distinct problems for individual graduate students and comparison between multiple students solving the same problems. It provides insights into how graduate students transfer and translate strategies between different problems while sensemaking. Graduate students showed persistence in activating different knowledge resources and consistent use of reasoning primitives across different problems sensemaking. The study investigated the impact of small nudging and scaffolding that resulted in significant improvements in the problem-solving approaches of graduate students. Another novel finding is that problem-solving approaches of graduate students significantly improved with successive attempts and multiple drawings for the same problem and across problems.</description>

      <title>Relating visual attention and learning in an online instructional physics module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning using Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) demands a high level of attention given the tendency to be distracted and mind-wander. How does the online STEM instructor know when learners are having attentional problems and the extent to which these problems affect learning? In the present study, the visual attentional and cognitive state of physics graduate students were probed while they went through a multimedia instructional module to refresh their knowledge of Newton's II Law. Data from an eye tracker, webcam, egocentric glasses, screen recording, and mouse and keyboard events were integrated to record learners' attention overt attention to the learning environment (+/-) and thinking about learning content (+/-) to analyze students' attention spans during learning from this module. On average, learners were found to be on-task and on-screen for a vast majority of time, with evidence of mind wandering. The learning module improved the participants efficiency with which they answered the questions correctly on a post-test relative to the pre-test. Further, there is a positive albeit statistically non-significant correlation between the improvement from pre- to post-test efficiency and the time spent on-screen and on-task during the module.</description>

      <title>AI-based Verbal and Visual Scaffolding in a Serious Game: Effects on Learning and Cognitive Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their interactive nature, serious games offer valuable opportunities for supporting learning in educational contexts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further opened the door to new forms of personalized scaffolding in education. In this study, we combine both worlds and study three types of AI-based scaffolding designs in a serious game: (i) no scaffolding, (ii) chat-based (verbal) scaffolding provided by an AI-based non-player character (NPC), and (iii) combined chat-(verbal) and action-based (visual) scaffolding in which the AI may both try to explain or demonstrate the next step towards a solution. The scaffolding conditions are embedded in Qookies, a serious game designed to introduce fundamental concepts of quantum technologies. A total of 152 school students, university students, and members of the general public were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The results show that all groups experience significant learning gains, confirming the overall effectiveness of the serious game itself. No significant differences in learning outcomes emerged between scaffolding conditions. However, intrinsic cognitive load was lower in the combined chat-and-action (verbal+visual) scaffolding condition compared to the chat (verbal)-only condition, suggesting that visual demonstrations may offer more accessible support. Interaction analyses further revealed that players engaged with the AI character primarily for level-related questions and action recommendations, while deeper interactions were relatively rare.</description>

      <title>CDIO-CT collaborative strategy for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation: an illustration of solving the period of mathematical pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem-project-oriented STEM education plays a significant role in training students' ability of innovation. Although the conceive-design-implement-operate (CDIO) approach and the computational thinking (CT) are hot topics in recent decade, there are still two deficiencies: the CDIO approach and CT are discussed separately and a general framework of coping with complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation is missing. In this paper, a collaborative strategy based on the CDIO and CT is proposed for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation with a general framework, in which the CDIO is about ``how to do", CT is about ``how to think", and the project means ``what to do". As an illustration, the problem of solving the period of mathematical pendulum (MP) is discussed in detail. The most challenging task involved in the problem is to compute the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (CEI-1). In the philosophy of STEM education, all problems have more than one solutions. For computing the CEI-1, four methods are discussed with a top-down strategy, which includes the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method, Gauss-Chebyshev method and Gauss-Legendre method. The algorithms involved can be utilized for R &amp; D projects of interest and be reused according to the requirements encountered. The general framework for solving complex STEM problem in system modeling and simulation is worth recommending to the college students and instructors.</description>

      <title>Thematic analysis of student perceptions of resources and demands experienced in introductory physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current work aims to better understand student course experiences for those who reported negative perceptions in introductory physics. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 students who reported negative perceptions of their class on a screening survey. Participants were asked to share general reflections on challenges and successes they experienced, as well as their reflections on specific aspects of the course (e.g., experiences with instructors and peers). Interview transcripts were then coded to identify the types of experiences students reported, whether they were experienced as positive or negative, as well as the themes and features associated with those experiences. Experiences with the classroom, course structure, instructors, and exams were most frequently reported as negative. Experiences with peers, help-seeking, course curriculum, and specific learning activities were the most positive, though only experiences with peers had more positive reports than negative. We then used a resources vs. demands framework [Soc Personal Psychol Compass 7, 637 (2013)] to interpret the common instructional, cognitive, and motivational themes and features reported across multiple contexts. We discuss the implications of the results for theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Solving Linear Systems of Equations with the Quantum HHL Algorithm: A Tutorial on the Physical and Mathematical Foundations for Undergraduate Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing enables the efficient resolution of complex problems, often outperforming classical methods across various applications. In 2009, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd proposed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, demonstrating exponential speedup (under ideal conditions) with a complexity of $poly(\log N)$, in contrast to classical approaches, which in the general case exhibit a complexity of $O(N^3)$, although they can achieve $O(N)$ in specific cases involving sparse matrices. This algorithm holds promise for advancements in machine learning, the solution of differential equations, linear regression, and cryptographic analysis. However, its structure is intricate, and there is a notable lack of detailed instructional materials in the literature. In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.</description>
