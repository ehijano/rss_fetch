      <title>On two-dimensional Dirac operators with critical delta-shell interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Dirac operators with singular interactions of electrostatic and Lorentzscalar type, supported either on a straight line or a circle. For certain critical values of the interaction strengths, the essential spectrum of such operators comprises an isolated point lying within the mass gap. We clarify the nature of this point in both geometries. For the straight line model, this point is known to be an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity, and we provide a detailed analysis of the corresponding eigenfunctions. By contrast, in the case of a circle, we show that the said point is not itself an eigenvalue, but rather an accumulation point of a double sequence of simple eigenvalues. In view of the high degree of symmetry of the configurations under analysis, this behavior is unexpected and our findings lead us to formulate some conjectures concerning critical singular interactions supported on generic smooth curves.</description>

      <title>On quasi-isospectrality of potentials and Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06110v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study quasi-isospectral operators as a generalization of isospectral operators. The paper contains both expository material and original results. We begin by reviewing known results on isospectral potentials on compact manifolds and finite intervals, and then introduce the notion of quasi-isospectrality. We next investigate the BMT method as a systematic approach to constructing quasi-isospectral Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval, and apply it to several boundary value problems. Our main result shows that any two quasi-isospectral closed manifolds of odd dimension are, in fact, isospectral. In addition, we extend classical compactness results for isospectral potentials on low-dimensional manifolds to the quasi-isospectral setting via heat trace asymptotics.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for radial conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of characterizing sequences of real numbers that arise as spectra of Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) maps for elliptic operators has attracted considerable attention over the past fifty years. In this article, we address this question in the simple setting of DtN maps associated with a rotation-invariant elliptic operator $\nabla \cdot (\gamma\nabla \centerdot )$ in the ball in Euclidean space. We show that the spectrum of such a DtN operator can be expressed as a universal term, determined solely by the boundary values of the conductivity $\gamma$, plus a sequence of Hausdorff moments of an integrable function, which we call the Born approximation of $\gamma$. We also show that this object is locally determined from the boundary by the corresponding values of the conductivity, a property that implies a local uniqueness result for the Calder\'on Problem in this setting. We also give a stability result: the functional mapping the Born approximation to its conductivity is H\"older stable in suitable Sobolev spaces. Finally, in order to refine the characterization of the Born approximation, we analyze its regularity properties and their dependence on the conductivity.</description>

      <title>Reactive capacitance of flat patches of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary shape to trap independent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the three-dimensional space. We focus on the total flux of particles onto the patch that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the respective roles of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive several bounds on the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with respect to the reactivity and the shape. Two probabilistic interpretations are presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for solving the associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose and validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit approximation for the reactive capacitance that depends only on the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch. This approximation opens promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct applications of these results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are discussed.</description>
