      <title>Radiological mapping and uncertainty quantification by a fast Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiological mapping plays a critical role in nuclear emergency response and environmental management activities. A radiation image, representing the spatial and intensity distribution of the radioactivity, is reconstructed from the radiation data and associated contextual information. Typical image reconstruction methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (ML-EM), only provide point estimates of the pixel or voxel activities without associated uncertainties. Here, we apply a new Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) sampler for radiation image reconstruction and uncertainty quantification. The MCLMC sampler properties are first tested with synthetic radiation images. Methods to obtain the radiation distribution estimate and the associated uncertainty from the samples drawn by MCLMC are discussed. Given sufficient measurement statistics, the radiation distribution estimate obtained from MCLMC results closely resembles the ground truth with less risk of over- or under-fitting compared to ML-EM. When MCLMC is run in parallel on a GPU, it can converge in about 10 seconds for an image with $10^3$--$10^4$ pixels, which is significantly faster than other comparable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. We also tested MCLMC on a dataset from a real distributed source radiological mapping campaign, and the reconstructed results agree well with ground truth. The fast MCLMC sampler therefore enables improved imaging accuracy and prompt uncertainty quantification for reconstructed radiation images, which can better inform decision-making in response to radiological events.</description>

      <title>Geometric and topological constraints on oral seal formation during infant breastfeeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breastfeeding efficiency relies on coordinated tongue motion, sustained tissue contact and maintenance of an effective intraoral seal. Current assessments of seal formation mainly use local kinematic descriptors or pressure recordings, which do not capture the global structural continuity of the sealing region. We introduce a systolic geometry based approach in which each sagittal ultrasound frame is modeled as a two dimensional deformable domain bounded by tongue, palate and nipple contours. Global seal continuity is formalized through the shortest closed curve that cannot be contracted to a point because of the overall geometry of the domain. The nipple defines a central region that must be circumferentially enclosed by a contact band to maintain suction. Within this band, closed curves encircling the nipple exactly once can be identified; the shortest of these curves defines a normalized systolic index representing the tightest admissible sealing loop. Simulations of symmetric thinning, localized discontinuities and cyclic perturbations reveal feasibility boundaries separating seal preserving from seal breaking configurations. Notably, admissible encircling curves may transiently disappear even when overall geometric motion remains smooth. By capturing global circumferential continuity that cannot be inferred from local metrics alone, our approach generates testable hypotheses linking the existence and temporal stability of admissible encircling curves to milk transfer efficiency and vacuum stability. Applied to segmented ultrasound data and integrated with pressure measurements, our systolic approach could provide a quantitative framework for objective assessment of seal integrity and longitudinal monitoring of latch stability.</description>

      <title>Enhanced distribution of molecules in the brain due to oscillations of the interstitial flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI measurements from a decade-old study of the physical properties of brain tissue observed a dynamic, pulsating fluid flow in the interstitial spaces of the brain attributed to the cardiac cycle. The effects of this cyclic flow pattern on the spatial distribution of molecules in the brain are modeled in this paper. The effects of oscillatory flow on the dispersion or volumetric transmission of a molecule that is advected by this flow is modeled by a mechanism hitherto neglected in the literature. An oscillatory random walk model is used to estimate the spread or effective diffusivity due to the oscillatory advection. Then, respiration effects are also estimated and the additional dispersion of molecules due to this are calculated in our model. Our model indicates that the observed oscillatory flow in the interstitial spaces due to cardiac as well as respiratory pulsatility can induce an effective diffusivity when the spread of the molecule is observed over times long compared with a cycle of the oscillation. This would help explain the high-volume transmission within the interstitium or brain parenchyma found in MRI measurements of a marker infused into the cerebrospinal fluid in human subjects that is well above what would be expected. Interstitial spaces should be viewed as a region of dynamic oscillatory flow driven by cardiac and respiratory cycles. This oscillatory flow could result in a significant dispersion of molecules and explain the higher-than-expected effective diffusion suggested in human studies. It may be possible to augment or slow this flow and concomitant spread by applying external forces.</description>

      <title>Placental contractions in uncomplicated pregnancies</title>

Abstract: In 2020 we first described placental contractions, and we have now undertaken a study to characterise them and seek features that might automatically separate them from uterine contractions. We recruited 36 healthy pregnant women to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 29 and 42 weeks of pregnancy in a single-centre, prospective, observational study. Participants had fetal ultrasound to confirm normal growth. Dynamic MRI was acquired for between 15 and 32 minutes using respiratory triggered, multi-slice, single shot, gradient echo, echo planar imaging covering the whole uterus. All participants had a live birth of a healthy baby weighing over the 10th centile for gestational age and none developed any associated conditions of placental dysfunction e.g. pre-eclampsia, or severe maternal or fetal villous malperfusion on placental histopathology. Any visible contractions were recorded for all participants who completed their MRI scan and placental contractions occurred in at least 60% of our healthy pregnant population with a median frequency of approximately 2 per hour, and a median duration of 2.4 minutes. Contractions involving a decrease in placental volume of &gt;10% were classified as either placental or uterine by visual observation. Placental contractions occurred more frequently than uterine contractions (p=0.0061), were associated with a larger increase in the surface area of the uterine wall not covered by the placenta (p=0.0015), placental sphericity (p&lt;0.0001) and longer duration (p=0.0151). All contractions led to an increase in the MRI parameter R2* in the placenta. There was large variation both between participants and between contractions from the same individual, in terms of time course and contractions features, with no apparent change across the gestational age range studied, although the largest fractional volume changes were detected at early gestation.</description>

      <title>A physics inspired and efficient transform for optoacoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optoacoustic imaging technologies require fast and accurate signal pre-processing algorithms to enable widespread deployment in clinical and home-care settings. However, they still rely on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the default tool for essential signal-conditioning operations, which imposes hard limits on both execution speed and signal-retrieval accuracy. Here, we present a new transform whose building blocks are directly inspired by the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. We compared its performance with the DFT and other classical transforms on common signal-processing tasks using both simulations and experimental datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed transform not only sets a new lower bound on computational complexity relative to the DFT, but also substantially outperforms classical transforms on basic signal-processing operations in terms of accuracy. We expect this transform to catalyze broader adoption of optoacoustic methods.</description>
