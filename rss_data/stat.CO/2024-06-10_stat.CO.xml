      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo without evaluating the target: an auxiliary variable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sampling tasks, it is common for target distributions to be known up to a normalizing constant. However, in many situations, evaluating even the unnormalized distribution can be costly or infeasible. This issue arises in scenarios such as sampling from the Bayesian posterior for tall datasets and the `doubly-intractable' distributions. In this paper, we begin by observing that seemingly different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the exchange algorithm, PoissonMH, and TunaMH, can be unified under a simple common procedure. We then extend this procedure into a novel framework that allows the use of auxiliary variables in both the proposal and acceptance-rejection steps. We develop the theory of the new framework, applying it to existing algorithms to simplify and extend their results. Several new algorithms emerge from this framework, with improved performance demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Computationally efficient permutation tests for the multivariate two-sample problem based on energy distance or maximum mean discrepancy statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-parametric two-sample tests based on energy distance or maximum mean discrepancy are widely used statistical tests for comparing multivariate data from two populations. While these tests enjoy desirable statistical properties, their test statistics can be expensive to compute as they require the computation of 3 distinct Euclidean distance (or kernel) matrices between samples, where the time complexity of each of these computations (namely, $O(n_{x}^2 p)$, $O(n_{y}^2 p)$, and $O(n_{x} n_{y} p)$) scales quadratically with the number of samples ($n_x$, $n_y$) and linearly with the number of variables ($p$). Since the standard permutation test requires repeated re-computations of these expensive statistics it's application to large datasets can become unfeasible. While several statistical approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they all sacrifice desirable statistical properties to decrease the computational cost (e.g., trade computation speed by a decrease in statistical power). A better computational strategy is to first pre-compute the Euclidean distance (kernel) matrix of the concatenated data, and then permute indexes and retrieve the corresponding elements to compute the re-sampled statistics. While this strategy can reduce the computation cost relative to the standard permutation test, it relies on the computation of a larger Euclidean distance (kernel) matrix with complexity $O((n_x + n_y)^2 p)$. In this paper, we present a novel computationally efficient permutation algorithm which only requires the pre-computation of the 3 smaller matrices and achieves large computational speedups without sacrificing finite-sample validity or statistical power. We illustrate its computational gains in a series of experiments and compare its statistical power to the current state-of-the-art approach for balancing computational cost and statistical performance.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Clustering using Shared Latent Variable Model for Assessing Alzheimers Disease Biomarkers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preclinical stage of many neurodegenerative diseases can span decades before symptoms become apparent. Understanding the sequence of preclinical biomarker changes provides a critical opportunity for early diagnosis and effective intervention prior to significant loss of patients' brain functions. The main challenge to early detection lies in the absence of direct observation of the disease state and the considerable variability in both biomarkers and disease dynamics among individuals. Recent research hypothesized the existence of subgroups with distinct biomarker patterns due to co-morbidities and degrees of brain resilience. Our ability to early diagnose and intervene during the preclinical stage of neurodegenerative diseases will be enhanced by further insights into heterogeneity in the biomarker-disease relationship. In this paper, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attempt to identify the systematic patterns within the heterogeneous AD biomarker-disease cascade. Specifically, we quantify the disease progression using a dynamic latent variable whose mixture distribution represents patient subgroups. Model estimation uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the number of clusters determined by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We report simulation studies that investigate the performance of the proposed model in finite sample settings that are similar to our motivating application. We apply the proposed model to the BIOCARD data, a longitudinal study that was conducted over two decades among individuals who were initially cognitively normal. Our application yields evidence consistent with the hypothetical model of biomarker dynamics presented in Jack et al. (2013). In addition, our analysis identified two subgroups with distinct disease-onset patterns. Finally, we develop a dynamic prediction approach to improve the precision of prognoses.</description>

      <title>Smiles2Dock: an open large-scale multi-task dataset for ML-based molecular docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Docking is a crucial component in drug discovery aimed at predicting the binding conformation and affinity between small molecules and target proteins. ML-based docking has recently emerged as a prominent approach, outpacing traditional methods like DOCK and AutoDock Vina in handling the growing scale and complexity of molecular libraries. However, the availability of comprehensive and user-friendly datasets for training and benchmarking ML-based docking algorithms remains limited. We introduce Smiles2Dock, an open large-scale multi-task dataset for molecular docking. We created a framework combining P2Rank and AutoDock Vina to dock 1.7 million ligands from the ChEMBL database against 15 AlphaFold proteins, giving us more than 25 million protein-ligand binding scores. The dataset leverages a wide range of high-accuracy AlphaFold protein models, encompasses a diverse set of biologically relevant compounds and enables researchers to benchmark all major approaches for ML-based docking such as Graph, Transformer and CNN-based methods. We also introduce a novel Transformer-based architecture for docking scores prediction and set it as an initial benchmark for our dataset. Our dataset and code are publicly available to support the development of novel ML-based methods for molecular docking to advance scientific research in this field.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Privatized Data with Unknown Sample Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop both theory and algorithms to analyze privatized data in the unbounded differential privacy(DP), where even the sample size is considered a sensitive quantity that requires privacy protection. We show that the distance between the sampling distributions under unbounded DP and bounded DP goes to zero as the sample size $n$ goes to infinity, provided that the noise used to privatize $n$ is at an appropriate rate; we also establish that ABC-type posterior distributions converge under similar assumptions. We further give asymptotic results in the regime where the privacy budget for $n$ goes to zero, establishing similarity of sampling distributions as well as showing that the MLE in the unbounded setting converges to the bounded-DP MLE. In order to facilitate valid, finite-sample Bayesian inference on privatized data in the unbounded DP setting, we propose a reversible jump MCMC algorithm which extends the data augmentation MCMC of Ju et al. (2022). We also propose a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to compute the MLE from privatized data in both bounded and unbounded DP. We apply our methodology to analyze a linear regression model as well as a 2019 American Time Use Survey Microdata File which we model using a Dirichlet distribution.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Perspective on Maximum Marginal Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a multiscale perspective on the problem of maximum marginal likelihood estimation. We consider and analyse a diffusion-based maximum marginal likelihood estimation scheme using ideas from multiscale dynamics. Our perspective is based on stochastic averaging; we make an explicit connection between ideas in applied probability and parameter inference in computational statistics. In particular, we consider a general class of coupled Langevin diffusions for joint inference of latent variables and parameters in statistical models, where the latent variables are sampled from a fast Langevin process (which acts as a sampler), and the parameters are updated using a slow Langevin process (which acts as an optimiser). We show that the resulting system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be viewed as a two-time scale system. To demonstrate the utility of such a perspective, we show that the averaged parameter dynamics obtained in the limit of scale separation can be used to estimate the optimal parameter, within the strongly convex setting. We do this by using recent uniform-in-time non-asymptotic averaging bounds. Finally, we conclude by showing that the slow-fast algorithm we consider here, termed Slow-Fast Langevin Algorithm, performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on a variety of examples. We believe that the stochastic averaging approach we provide in this paper enables us to look at these algorithms from a fresh angle, as well as unlocking the path to develop and analyse new methods using well-established averaging principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data subsampling has become widely recognized as a tool to overcome computational and economic bottlenecks in analyzing massive datasets. We contribute to the development of adaptive design for estimation of finite population characteristics, using active learning and adaptive importance sampling. We propose an active sampling strategy that iterates between estimation and data collection with optimal subsamples, guided by machine learning predictions on yet unseen data. The method is illustrated on virtual simulation-based safety assessment of advanced driver assistance systems. Substantial performance improvements are demonstrated compared to traditional sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Methods for Amortised Parameter Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based methods for making statistical inference have evolved dramatically over the past 50 years, keeping pace with technological advancements. The field is undergoing a new revolution as it embraces the representational capacity of neural networks, optimisation libraries and graphics processing units for learning complex mappings between data and inferential targets. The resulting tools are amortised, in the sense that they allow inference to be made quickly through fast feedforward operations. In this article we review recent progress made in the context of point estimation, approximate Bayesian inference, summary-statistic construction, and likelihood approximation. The review also covers available software, and includes a simple illustration to showcase the wide array of tools available for amortised inference and the benefits they offer over state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The article concludes with an overview of relevant topics and an outlook on future research directions.</description>

      <title>Estimation of uncertainties in the density driven flow in fractured porous media using MLMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Multi Level Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainties in a Henry-like salt water intrusion problem with a fracture. The flow is induced by the variation of the density of the fluid phase, which depends on the mass fraction of salt. We assume that the fracture has a known fixed location but an uncertain aperture. Other input uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields and the recharge. In our setting, porosity and permeability vary spatially and recharge is time-dependent. For each realisation of these uncertain parameters, the evolution of the mass fraction and pressure fields is modelled by a system of non-linear and time-dependent PDEs with a jump of the solution at the fracture. The uncertainties propagate into the distribution of the salt concentration, which is an important characteristic of the quality of water resources. We show that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is able to reduce the overall computational cost compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by balancing discretisation and statistical errors. Multiple scenarios are evaluated at different spatial and temporal mesh levels. The deterministic solver ug4 is run in parallel to calculate all stochastic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Liouville Flow Importance Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>
