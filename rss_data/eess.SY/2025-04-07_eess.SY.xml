      <title>Agile Temporal Discretization for Symbolic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As control systems grow in complexity, abstraction-based methods have become essential for designing controllers with formal guarantees. However, a key limitation of these methods is their reliance on discrete-time models, typically obtained by discretizing continuous-time systems with a fixed time step. This discretization leads to two major problems: when the time step is small, the abstraction includes numerous stuttering and spurious trajectories, making controller synthesis suboptimal or even infeasible; conversely, a large time step may also render control design infeasible due to a lack of flexibility. In this work, drawing inspiration from Reinforcement Learning concepts, we introduce temporal abstractions, which allow for a flexible time-step. We provide a method for constructing such abstractions and formally establish their correctness in controller design. Furthermore we show how to apply these to optimal control under reachability specifications. Finally we showcase our methods on two numerical examples, highlighting that our approach leads to better controllers.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Learning in Stackelberg Games with an Application to Electric Ride-Hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently learning to play single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg games when the leader lacks knowledge of the lower-level game. Such games arise in hierarchical decision-making problems involving self-interested agents. For example, in electric ride-hailing markets, a central authority aims to learn optimal charging prices to shape fleet distributions and charging patterns of ride-hailing companies. Existing works typically apply gradient-based methods to find the leader's optimal strategy. Such methods are impractical as they require that the followers share private utility information with the leader. Instead, we treat the lower-level game as a black box, assuming only that the followers' interactions approximate a Nash equilibrium while the leader observes the realized cost of the resulting approximation. Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the leader's cost function, we develop a no-regret algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium in $O(\sqrt{T})$ rounds. Finally, we validate our approach through a numerical case study on optimal pricing in electric ride-hailing markets.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach For Pose and Velocity Estimation Using IMU and Inertial/Body-Frame Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses accurate pose estimation (position, velocity, and orientation) for a rigid body using a combination of generic inertial-frame and/or body-frame measurements along with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). By embedding the original state space, $\so \times \R^3 \times \R^3$, within the higher-dimensional Lie group $\sefive$, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics and outputs within a structured, geometric framework. In particular, this embedding enables a decoupling of the resulting geometric error dynamics: the translational error dynamics follow a structure similar to the error dynamics of a continuous-time Kalman filter, which allows for a time-varying gain design using the Riccati equation. Under the condition of uniform observability, we establish that the proposed observer design on $\sefive$ guarantees almost global asymptotic stability. We validate the approach in simulations for two practical scenarios: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) and GPS-aided INS. The proposed method significantly simplifies the design of nonlinear geometric observers for INS, providing a generalized and robust approach to state estimation.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Methods for EV Climate Dynamics: Comparing eDMD Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, data-driven algorithms based on Koopman Operator Theory are applied to identify and predict the nonlinear dynamics of a vapor compression system and cabin temperature in a light-duty electric vehicle. By leveraging a high-fidelity nonlinear HVAC model, the system behavior is captured in a lifted higher-dimensional state space, enabling a linear representation. A comparative analysis of three Koopman-based system identification approaches (polynomial libraries, radial basis functions (RBF), and neural network-based dictionary learning) is conducted. Accurate prediction of power consumption over entire driving cycles is demonstrated by incorporating power as a measurable output within the Koopman framework. The performance of each method is rigorously evaluated through simulations under various driving cycles and ambient conditions, highlighting their potential for real-time prediction and control in energy-efficient vehicle climate management. This study offers a scalable, data-driven methodology that can be extended to other complex nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Promoting Reachability Analysis and Optimization of Constrained Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constrained zonotope is a polytopic set representation widely used for set-based analysis and control of dynamic systems. This paper considers the problem of tailoring a quadratic program (QP) optimization algorithm to the particular structure of constrained zonotopes and vice-versa. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented that makes efficient use of the constrained zonotope structure. To increase the efficiency of the ADMM iterations, reachability calculations are presented that increase the sparsity of the matrices used to define a constrained zonotope. Numerical results show that the ADMM algorithm solves optimal control problems built using these reachability calculations faster than state-of-the-art QP solvers using conventional problem formulations, especially for large problems. Constrained zonotope reachability and optimization calculations are combined within a set-valued state estimation and moving horizon estimation algorithm, and a projection-based infeasibility detection method is presented for efficient safety verification of system trajectories.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Controlling Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for controlling linear dynamical systems under adversarial disturbances and cost functions. Our algorithm achieves a running time that scales polylogarithmically with the inverse of the stability margin, improving upon prior methods with polynomial dependence maintaining the same regret guarantees. The technique, which may be of independent interest, is based on a novel convex relaxation that approximates linear control policies using spectral filters constructed from the eigenvectors of a specific Hankel matrix.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-Directed Preventive Dynamic Security Control via Coordinated Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike common faults, three-phase short-circuit faults in power systems pose significant challenges. These faults can lead to out-of-step (OOS) conditions and jeopardize the system's dynamic security. The rapid dynamics of these faults often exceed the time of protection actions, thus limiting the effectiveness of corrective schemes. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep-learning-based mechanism, namely, a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism, to predict OOS conditions early and enhance the system's fault resilience. The results of the study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of early prediction and robustness against such faults in various operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Robot Control in Dynamic Environments Using Belief Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments can be challenging due to factors such as unmodeled dynamics, noisy sensor measurements, and partial observability. To account for these limitations, it is common to maintain a belief distribution over the true state. This belief could be a non-parametric, sample-based representation to capture uncertainty more flexibly. In this paper, we propose a novel form of Belief Control Barrier Functions (BCBFs) specifically designed to ensure safety in dynamic environments under stochastic dynamics and a sample-based belief about the environment state. Our approach incorporates provable concentration bounds on tail risk measures into BCBFs, effectively addressing possible multimodal and skewed belief distributions represented by samples. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness against distributional shifts up to a predefined bound. We validate the effectiveness and real-time performance (approximately 1kHz) of the proposed method through two simulated underwater robotic applications: object tracking and dynamic collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Method to Ensure Cascade Stability of Traffic Load Balancing in O-RAN Based Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load balancing in open radio access networks (O-RAN) is critical for ensuring efficient resource utilization, and the user's experience by evenly distributing network traffic load. Current research mainly focuses on designing load-balancing algorithms to allocate resources while overlooking the cascade stability of load balancing, which is critical to prevent endless handover. The main challenge to analyse the cascade stability lies in the difficulty of establishing an accurate mathematical model to describe the process of load balancing due to its nonlinearity and high-dimensionality. In our previous theoretical work, a simplified general dynamic function was used to analyze the stability. However, it is elusive whether this function is close to the reality of the load balance process. To solve this problem, 1) a data-driven method is proposed to identify the dynamic model of the load balancing process according to the real-time traffic load data collected from the radio units (RUs); 2) the stability condition of load balancing process is established for the identified dynamics model. Based on the identified dynamics model and the stability condition, the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) can control RUs to achieve a desired load-balancing state while ensuring cascade stability.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Building Climate Control for Mitigating Heat Pump Noise Pollution (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise pollution from heat pumps (HPs) has been an emerging concern to their broader adoption, especially in densely populated areas. This paper explores a model predictive control (MPC) approach for building climate control, aimed at minimizing the noise nuisance generated by HPs. By exploiting a piecewise linear approximation of HP noise patterns and assuming linear building thermal dynamics, the proposed design can be generalized to handle various HP acoustic patterns with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Additionally, two computationally efficient options for defining the noise cost function in the proposed MPC design are discussed. Numerical experiments on a high-fidelity building simulator are performed to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed design. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the noise pollution caused by HPs with negligible energy cost increase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for rigid body systems in three-dimensional space. We introduce a new matrix Lie group SE_{3+n}(3), whose elements are composed of the pose, gravity, linear velocity and landmark positions, and propose an almost globally asymptotically stable nonlinear geometric observer that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data with landmark measurements. The proposed observer estimates the pose and map up to a constant position and a constant rotation about the gravity direction. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed observer, demonstrating its potential for robust SLAM applications.</description>

      <title>Task load dependent decision referrals for joint binary classification in human-automation teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal decision referrals in human-automation teams performing binary classification tasks. The automation, which includes a pre-trained classifier, observes data for a batch of independent tasks, analyzes them, and may refer a subset of tasks to a human operator for fresh and final analysis. Our key modeling assumption is that human performance degrades with task load. We model the problem of choosing which tasks to refer as a stochastic optimization problem and show that, for a given task load, it is optimal to myopically refer tasks that yield the largest reduction in expected cost, conditional on the observed data. This provides a ranking scheme and a policy to determine the optimal set of tasks for referral. We evaluate this policy against a baseline through an experimental study with human participants. Using a radar screen simulator, participants made binary target classification decisions under time constraint. They were guided by a decision rule provided to them, but were still prone to errors under time pressure. An initial experiment estimated human performance model parameters, while a second experiment compared two referral policies. Results show statistically significant gains for the proposed optimal referral policy over a blind policy that determines referrals using the automation and human-performance models but not based on the observed data.</description>

      <title>Cyber Insurance Design for Load Variation and Load Curtailment in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of renewable energy resources (RES) is continuously integrated into power systems contributing towards the green energy and net zero transition. However, the uncertainties of RES generation and load variations often lead to potentially high operational costs. Furthermore, added threats of cyber-attacks such as load-altering attacks (LAAs) via distributed energy resource/load interfaces can lead to substantial load variations. In this paper, we propose a cyber insurance framework to mitigate excessive expenses in load variation conditions while considering a renewable-rich grid. We investigate how operational costs and load curtailments can be influenced due to load variations by solving a bi-level optimization problem and performing Monte Carlo simulations. We use the semi-Markov process (SMP) to estimate the probability of extreme situations that the cyber insurance covers, whose premium and coverage are designed based on its value at risk and tail value at risk. A modified IEEE-118 test bus system considering PV generations, battery storage, and energy market interaction, along with a load curtailment strategy, is used to evaluate the proposed framework. Results show that load variations of up to 30% can lead to doubling the daily operational cost, demonstrating the feasibility of using a cyber insurance policy to hedge against financial risk.</description>

      <title>Optimal Teaming for Coordination with Bounded Rationality via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teaming is the process of establishing connections among agents within a system to enable collaboration toward achieving a collective goal. This paper examines teaming in the context of a network of agents learning to coordinate with bounded rationality. In our framework, the team structure is represented via a weighted graph, and the agents use log-linear learning. We formulate the design of the graph's weight matrix as a convex optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the probability of learning a Nash equilibrium while minimizing a connectivity cost. Despite its convexity, solving this optimization problem is computationally challenging, as the objective function involves the summation over the action profile space, which grows exponentially with the number of agents. Leveraging the underlying symmetry and convexity properties of the problem, when there are no sparsity constraints, we prove that there exists an optimal solution corresponding to a uniformly weighted graph, simplifying to a one-dimensional convex optimization problem. Additionally, we show that the optimal weight decreases monotonically with the agent's rationality, implying that when the agents become more rational the optimal team requires less connectivity.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Boresight Control of Spacecraft Under Pointing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes an integrated boresight guidance and control (IBGC) scheme to address the boresight reorientation problem of spacecraft under temporal and pointing constraints. A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability theorem. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.</description>

      <title>Learning Flatness-Preserving Residuals for Pure-Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study residual dynamics learning for differentially flat systems, where a nominal model is augmented with a learned correction term from data. A key challenge is that generic residual parameterizations may destroy flatness, limiting the applicability of flatness-based planning and control methods. To address this, we propose a framework for learning flatness-preserving residual dynamics in systems whose nominal model admits a pure-feedback form. We show that residuals with a lower-triangular structure preserve both the flatness of the system and the original flat outputs. Moreover, we provide a constructive procedure to recover the flatness diffeomorphism of the augmented system from that of the nominal model. We then introduce a learning algorithm that fits such residuals from trajectory data using smooth function approximators. Our approach is validated in simulation on a 2D quadrotor subject to unmodeled aerodynamic effects. We demonstrate that the resulting learned flat model enables tracking performance comparable to nonlinear model predictive control ($5\times$ lower tracking error than the nominal flat model) while also achieving over a $20\times$ speedup in computation.</description>

      <title>Economic Battery Storage Dispatch with Deep Reinforcement Learning from Rule-Based Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to economic battery dispatch problems has significantly increased recently. However, optimizing battery dispatch over long horizons can be challenging due to delayed rewards. In our experiments we observe poor performance of popular actor-critic algorithms when trained on yearly episodes with hourly resolution. To address this, we propose an approach extending soft actor-critic (SAC) with learning from demonstrations. The special feature of our approach is that, due to the absence of expert demonstrations, the demonstration data is generated through simple, rule-based policies. We conduct a case study on a grid-connected microgrid and use if-then-else statements based on the wholesale price of electricity to collect demonstrations. These are stored in a separate replay buffer and sampled with linearly decaying probability along with the agent's own experiences. Despite these minimal modifications and the imperfections in the demonstration data, the results show a drastic performance improvement regarding both sample efficiency and final rewards. We further show that the proposed method reliably outperforms the demonstrator and is robust to the choice of rule, as long as the rule is sufficient to guide early training into the right direction.</description>

      <title>ChronoSync: A Decentralized Chronometer Synchronization Protocol for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a decentralized time synchronization algorithm for multi-agent systems. Each agent possesses two clocks, a hardware clock that is perturbed by environmental phenomena (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, g forces, etc.) and a steerable software clock that inherits the perturbations affecting the hardware clock. Under these disturbances and the independent time kept by the hardware clocks, our consensus-based controller enables all agents to steer their software-defined clocks into practical synchronization while achieving a common user-defined clock drift. Furthermore, we treat the drift of each hardware clock as an unknown parameter, which our algorithm can accurately estimate. The coupling of the agents is modeled by a connected, undirected, and static graph. However, each agent possesses a timer mechanism that determines when to broadcast a sample of its software time and update its own software-time estimate. Hence, communication between agents can be directed, intermittent, and asynchronous. The closed-loop dynamics of the ensemble is modeled using a hybrid system, where a Lyapunov-based stability analysis demonstrates that a set encoding the time synchronization and clock drift estimation objectives is globally practically exponentially stable. The performance suggested by the theoretical development is confirmed in simulation.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reachability Analysis for Piecewise Affine System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid systems play a crucial role in modeling real-world applications where discrete and continuous dynamics interact, including autonomous vehicles, power systems, and traffic networks. Safety verification for these systems requires determining whether system states can enter unsafe regions under given initial conditions and uncertainties, a question directly addressed by reachability analysis. However, hybrid systems present unique difficulties because their state space is divided into multiple regions with distinct dynamic models, causing traditional data-driven methods to produce inadequate over-approximations of reachable sets at region boundaries where dynamics change abruptly. This paper introduces a novel approach using hybrid zonotopes for data-driven reachability analysis of piecewise affine systems. Our method addresses the boundary transition problem by developing computational algorithms that calculate the family of set models guaranteed to contain the true system trajectories. Additionally, we extend and evaluate three methods for set-based estimation that account for input-output data with measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Redefining Information Freshness: AoGI for Generative AI in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is playing an increasingly important role in enriching and facilitating human life by generating various useful information, of which real-time GenAI is a significant part and has great potential in applications such as real-time robot control, automated driving, augmented reality, etc. There are a variety of information updating processes in real-time GenAI, and the age of information (AoI) is an effective metric for evaluating information freshness. However, due to the diversity and generativity of information in real-time GenAI, it may be incompatible to directly use existing information aging metrics to assess its timeliness. In this article, we introduce a new concept called Age of Generative Information (AoGI) to evaluate the freshness of generative information, which takes into account the information delay caused not only by sampling and transmission, but also by computation. Furthermore, since real-time GenAI services are often supported by mobile-edge-cloud (MEC) collaborative computing in 6G networks and some of the generated information is privacy sensitive, it is recommended that the identities of edge and cloud should always be verified in a zero-trust manner. We introduce the concept of Age of Trust (AoT) to characterise the decay process of their trust level. We also discuss the optimisations of these evolved information aging metrics, focusing on the impact of dynamic external conditions, including wireless environments and limited computational resources. Finally, we highlight several open challenges in providing timeliness guarantees for real-time GenAI services.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking in Coalition Games for Uncertain Euler-Lagrange Systems With Application to USV Swarm Confrontation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a coalition game with local and coupling constraints is studied for uncertain Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems subject to disturbances with unknown bounds. In the coalition game, each agent collaborates with other agents within the same coalition to optimize its coalition's cost function while simultaneously competing against agents in other coalitions. Under a distributed framework where each agent has access only to its own action, cost function, and constraint parameters, a distributed strategy is proposed to seek the Nash equilibrium (NE). By combining adaptive methods and sign functions, model uncertainties and disturbances with unknown bounds in the EL system are compensated and suppressed, respectively. Furthermore, an integration of adaptive methods and consensus protocols is employed to update the Lagrange multipliers of both local and coupling constraints. A dynamic average consensus is employed to estimate the gradient of coalition function, while the leader-following protocol is adopted to estimate the actions of other agents. By leveraging Lyapunov theory, the NE is proven to be asymptotically stable. Moreover, an unmanned surface vehicle swarm confrontation is meticulously modeled and analyzed in the coalition game framework. A diverse array of tasks, including formation, encirclement, and interception, are systematically formulated. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fine Tuning a Data-Driven Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, many industries have developed high-fidelity simulators, such as digital twins, to represent physical systems, although their parameters must be calibrated to accurately reflect the true system. This need has paved the way for the creation of data-driven parameter estimators to calibrate such simulators. These estimators are constructed by generating synthetic observations for various parameter settings of the simulator and then establishing a mapping from these observations to the corresponding parameter settings using supervised learning. However, if the true system's parameters fall outside the range of the sampled parameter set used to construct the mapping, the resulting predictions will suffer from out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. In this paper, we introduce a fine-tuning approach for a specific data-driven estimator, known as the Two-Stage estimator, designed to mitigate the problems associated with OOD and improve its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Confidence-Aware Learning Optimal Terminal Guidance via Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern aerospace guidance systems demand rigorous constraint satisfaction, optimal performance, and computational efficiency. Traditional analytical methods struggle to simultaneously satisfy these requirements. While data driven methods have shown promise in learning optimal guidance strategy, challenges still persist in generating well-distributed optimal dataset and ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of learned strategies. This paper presents a confidence-aware learning framework that addresses these limitations. First, a region-controllable optimal data generation method is proposed leveraging Hamiltonian state transition matrices, enabling efficient generation of optimal trajectories of specified data distribution. Then, to obtain a lightweight and effective dataset for efficient strategy learning, an error-distribution-smoothing method is incorporated to employ data filtering, which reduces dataset size by almost 90% while preserving prediction accuracy. To assess the operational domain of the learned strategy, a confidence-aware learning guidance strategy is proposed based on gaussian process regression, achieving constraint satisfaction even beyond training distributions. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed learning framework in terms of data generation, data filtering and strategy learning.</description>

      <title>Persistently Exciting Data-Driven Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistence of excitation (PE) of the system input is a fundamental requirement for the successful operation of data-driven model predictive control, as it ensures that the input--output data contains sufficient information about the underlying system dynamics. Nonetheless, this property is usually assumed rather than guaranteed. This paper introduces a novel data-driven predictive control formulation that maintains persistence of excitation. The technical development that permits this is the characterization of the nonexciting input set i.e. the set of inputs that lead to loss of PE, and the consequent derivation of a pair of disjoint, linear inequality constraints on the input that, if satisfied, maintain PE. When used in the predictive control formulation, these constraints lead to a mixed-integer optimal control problem with a single binary variable or, equivalently, a pair of disjoint quadratic programming problems that can be efficiently and reliably solved in parallel. Numerical examples show how these constraints are able to maintain persistence of excitation on the input during the controller's operation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Robust Optimization for Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust trajectory optimization method for constrained nonlinear dynamical systems subject to unknown bounded disturbances. In particular, we seek optimal control policies that remain robustly feasible with respect to all possible realizations of the disturbances within prescribed uncertainty sets. To address this problem, we introduce a bi-level optimization algorithm. The outer level employs a trust-region successive convexification approach which relies on linearizing the nonlinear dynamics and robust constraints. The inner level involves solving the resulting linearized robust optimization problems, for which we derive tractable convex reformulations and present an Augmented Lagrangian method for efficiently solving them. To further enhance the robustness of our methodology on nonlinear systems, we also illustrate that potential linearization errors can be effectively modeled as unknown disturbances as well. Simulation results verify the applicability of our approach in controlling nonlinear systems in a robust manner under unknown disturbances. The promise of effectively handling approximation errors in such successive linearization schemes from a robust optimization perspective is also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Conformal Data-driven Control of Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems under Collaborative Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the control of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to additive stochastic noise and collaborative signal temporal logic (STL) specifications to be satisfied with a desired probability. Given available disturbance datasets, we leverage conformal prediction (CP) to address the underlying chance-constrained multi-agent STL synthesis problem in a distribution-free manner. By introducing nonconformity scores as functions of prediction regions (PRs) of error trajectories, we develop an iterative PR-scaling and disturbance-feedback synthesis approach to bound training error trajectory samples. These bounds are then calibrated using a separate dataset, providing probabilistic guarantees via CP. Subsequently, we relax the underlying stochastic optimal control problem by tightening the robustness functions of collaborative tasks based on their Lipschitz constants and the computed error bounds. To address scalability, we exploit the compositional structure of the multi-agent STL formula and propose a model-predictive-control-like algorithm, where agent-level problems are solved in a distributed fashion. Lastly, we showcase the benefits of the proposed method in comparison with [1] via an illustrative example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm utilizing the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in conjunction with sequential constraint tightening to address mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problems associated with traffic light systems and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed-traffic intersections. We formulate a comprehensive MIQP model aimed at optimizing the coordination of traffic light systems and CAVs, thereby fully capitalizing on the advantages of CAV integration under conditions of high penetration rates. To effectively approximate the intricate multi-agent MIQP challenges, we develop a distributed algorithm that employs proximal ADMM for solving the convex relaxation of the MIQP while systematically tightening the constraint coefficients to uphold integrality requirements. The performance of our control framework and the efficacy of the distributed algorithm are rigorously validated through a series of simulations conducted across varying penetration rates and traffic volumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems evolve with the increasing integration of renewable energy sources and smart grid technologies, there is a growing demand for flexible and scalable modeling approaches capable of capturing the complex dynamics of modern grids. This review focuses on symbolic regression, a powerful methodology for deriving parsimonious and interpretable mathematical models directly from data. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of symbolic regression methods, including sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, automatic regression for governing equations, and deep symbolic regression, highlighting their applications in power systems. Through comparative case studies of the single machine infinite bus system, grid-following, and grid-forming inverter, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and suitability of each symbolic regression method in modeling nonlinear power system dynamics. Additionally, we identify critical research gaps and discuss future directions for leveraging symbolic regression in the optimization, control, and operation of modern power grids. This review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and engineers seeking innovative, data-driven solutions for modeling in the context of evolving power system infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: This report details the translation and testing of multiple benchmarks, including the Six Vehicle Platoon, Two Bouncing Ball, Three Tank System, and Four-Dimensional Linear Switching, which represent continuous and hybrid systems. These benchmarks were gathered from past instances involving diverse verification tools such as SpaceEx, Flow*, HyST, MATLAB-Simulink, Stateflow, etc. They cover a range of systems modeled as hybrid automata, providing a comprehensive set for analysis and evaluation. Initially, we created models for all four systems using various suitable tools. Subsequently, these models were converted to the SpaceEx format and then translated into different formats compatible with various verification tools.

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Anesthetics Collaborative Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated control of personalized multiple anesthetics in clinical Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) is crucial yet challenging. Current systems, including target-controlled infusion (TCI) and closed-loop systems, either rely on relatively static pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models or focus on single anesthetic control, limiting personalization and collaborative control. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Value Decomposition Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (VD-MADRL). VD-MADRL optimizes the collaboration between two anesthetics propofol (Agent I) and remifentanil (Agent II). And It uses a Markov Game (MG) to identify optimal actions among heterogeneous agents. We employ various value function decomposition methods to resolve the credit allocation problem and enhance collaborative control. We also introduce a multivariate environment model based on random forest (RF) for anesthesia state simulation. Additionally, a data resampling and alignment technique ensures synchronized trajectory data. Our experiments on general and thoracic surgery datasets show that VD-MADRL performs better than human experience. It improves dose precision and keeps anesthesia states stable, providing great clinical value.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hysteresis model of grain-oriented ferromagnetic material using neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the behavior of grain-oriented (GO) ferromagnetic materials is crucial for modeling the electromagnetic devices. In this paper, neural operator models, including Fourier neural operator (FNO), U-net combined FNO (U-FNO) and Deep operator network (DeepONet) are used to approximate the dynamic hysteresis models of GO steel. Furthermore, two types of data augmentation strategies including cyclic rolling augmentation and Gaussian data augmentation (GDA) are implemented to enhance the learning ability of models. With the inclusion of these augmentation techniques, the optimized models account for not only the peak values of the magnetic flux density but also the effects of different frequencies and phase shifts. The accuracy of all models is assessed using the L2-norm of the test data and the mean relative error (MRE) of calculated core losses. Each model performs well in different scenarios, but FNO consistently achieves the best performance across all cases.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Data-Driven Min-Max MPC: Designing Rational Controllers via Sum-of-squares Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven min-max model predictive control (MPC) scheme to control unknown discrete-time bilinear systems. Based on a sequence of noisy input-state data, we state a set-membership representation for the unknown system dynamics. Then, we derive a sum-of-squares (SOS) program that minimizes an upper bound on the worst-case cost over all bilinear systems consistent with the data. As a crucial technical ingredient, the SOS program involves a rational controller parameterization to improve feasibility and tractability. We prove that the resulting data-driven MPC scheme ensures closed-loop stability and constraint satisfaction for the unknown bilinear system. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed scheme in a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of undiscouted infinite-horizon optimal control for deterministic systems where the classic value iteration does not converge. For such systems, we propose to use the Ces\`aro mean to define the infinitehorizon optimal control problem and the corresponding infinitehorizon value function. Moreover, for this value function, we introduce the Ces\`aro value iteration and prove its convergence for the special case of systems with periodic optimal operating behavior.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric 4.77 Three-Way Unequal Filtering Power Divider/Combiner for Communication Systems Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel three-way unequal filtering power divider/combiner, addressing challenges in unequal power distribution while incorporating filtering functions in communication systems. Wilkinson power divider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using quarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is popularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation and simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the use of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering functionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss coefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach involving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as separate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD) consolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower footprint and lower loss coefficient in a system. Circuit modelling and electromagnetic (EM) simulations were conducted to ensure alignment between theoretical and practical results. The design demonstrates effective unequal power division at the three output ports while maintaining very good filtering performance. Results show a return loss better than 15 dB and a minimum insertion loss of 1.2 dB. The overall size of the device is 32.2 x 50.0 mm. This paper contributes to advancements in power divider design by addressing unequal power division challenges and integrating filtering functions. The findings offer a foundation for future developments in advanced power divider/combiner systems, with insights into potential challenges and areas for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Design of a compact low loss 2-way millimetre wave power divider for future communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a rectangular-shaped power divider has been presented operating at 27.9 GHz. The power divider has achieved acceptable results for important parameters such as S11, S12, S21, and S22. The substrate employed for the power divider is Roger 3003 which has a thickness of 1.6 mm. This power divider provides a reflection coefficient of -12.2 dB and an insertion loss of 3.1 dB at 28 GHz. This ka-band T-junction power divider covers 68% of the bandwidth. Dimensions of the ka-band T-junction power divider are 50x80 mm. Due to its dimensions and bandwidth this power divider is more suitable for millimetre wave applications like RADAR, beamforming, and 5G applications.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Fog Automation: The New Paradigm towards Autonomous Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) represent a future vision where industrial systems achieve full autonomy, integrating physical processes seamlessly with communication, computing and control technologies while holistically embedding intelligence. Cloud-Fog Automation is a new digitalized industrial automation reference architecture that has been recently proposed. This architecture is a fundamental paradigm shift from the traditional International Society of Automation (ISA)-95 model to accelerate the convergence and synergy of communication, computing, and control towards a fully autonomous ICPS. With the deployment of new wireless technologies to enable almost-deterministic ultra-reliable low-latency communications, a joint design of optimal control and computing has become increasingly important in modern ICPS. It is also imperative that system-wide cyber-physical security are critically enforced. Despite recent advancements in the field, there are still significant research gaps and open technical challenges. Therefore, a deliberate rethink in co-designing and synergizing communications, computing, and control (which we term "3C co-design") is required. In this paper, we position Cloud-Fog Automation with 3C co-design as the new paradigm to realize the vision of autonomous ICPS. We articulate the state-of-the-art and future directions in the field, and specifically discuss how goal-oriented communication, virtualization-empowered computing, and Quality of Service (QoS)-aware control can drive Cloud-Fog Automation towards a fully autonomous ICPS, while accounting for system-wide cyber-physical security.</description>

      <title>Fault Localisation in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel fault localisation methodology for linear time-invariant electrical networks with infinite-dimensional edge dynamics and uncertain fault dynamics. The theory accommodates instability and also bounded propagation delays in the network. The goal is to estimate the location of a fault along a given network edge, using sensors positioned arbitrarily throughout the network. Passive faults of unknown impedance are considered, along with stable faults of known impedance. To illustrate the approach, we tackle a significant use-case: a multi-conductor transmission line, with dynamics modelled by the Telegrapher's equation, subject to a line-to-ground fault. Frequency-domain insights are used to reformulate the general fault localisation problem into a non-convex scalar optimisation problem, of which the true fault location is guaranteed to be a global minimiser. Numerical experiments are run to quantify localisation performance over a range of fault resistances.</description>

      <title>Age-of-information minimization under energy harvesting and non-stationary environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on minimizing the age of information for multiple energy harvesting sources that sample data and transmit it to a sink node. At each time, the central scheduler selects one of the sources to probe the quality of its channel to the sink node, and then the assessed channel quality is utilized to determine whether a source will sample and send the packet. For a single source case, we assume that the probed channel quality is known at each time instant, model the problem of AoI minimization as a Markov decision process, and prove the optimal sampling policy threshold structure. We then use this threshold structure and propose an AEC-SW-UCRL2 algorithm to handle unknown and time varying energy harvesting rate and channel statistics, motivated by the popular SWUCRL2 algorithm for non stationary reinforcement learning. This algorithm is applicable when an upper bound is available for the total variation of each of these quantities over a time horizon. Furthermore, in situations where these variation budgets are not accessible, we introduce the AEC-BORL algorithm, motivated by the well known BORL algorithm. For the multiple source case, we demonstrate that the AoI minimization problem can be formulated as a constrained MDP, which can be relaxed using a Lagrange multiplier and decoupled into sub problems across source nodes. We also derive Whittle index based source scheduling policy for probing and an optimal threshold policy for source sampling. We next leverage this Whittle index and threshold structure to develop the WIT-SW-UCRL2 algorithm for unknown time varying energy harvesting rates and channel statistics under their respective variation budgets. Moreover, we also proposed a Whittle index and threshold based bandit over reinforcement learning (WIT-BORL) algorithm for unknown variation budgets. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Control Barrier Functions for Nonholonomic Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of guaranteeing safety of multiple coordinated agents moving in dynamic environments. It has recently been shown that this problem can be efficiently solved through the notion of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). However, for nonholonomic vehicles that are required to keep positive speeds, existing CBFs lose their validity. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid formulation based on synergistic CBFs (SCBFs), which leverages a discrete switching mechanism to avoid configurations that would render the CBF invalid. Unlike existing approaches, our method ensures safety in the presence of moving obstacles and inter-agent interactions while respecting nonzero speed restrictions. We formally analyze the feasibility of the constraints with respect to actuation limits, and the efficacy of the solution is demonstrated in simulation of a multi-agent coordination problem in the presence of moving obstacles.</description>

      <title>Infinite precedence graphs for consistency verification in P-time event graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precedence constraints are inequalities used to model time dependencies. In 1958, Gallai proved that a finite system of precedence constraints admits solutions if and only if the corresponding precedence graph does not contain positive-weight circuits. We show that this result extends naturally to the case of infinitely many constraints. We then analyze two specific classes of infinite precedence graphs -- $\mathbb{N}$-periodic and ultimately periodic graphs -- and prove that the existence of solutions of their related constraints can be verified in strongly polynomial time. The obtained algorithms find applications in P-time event graphs, which are a subclass of P-time Petri nets able to model production systems under cyclic schedules where tasks need to be performed within given time windows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in military communications and networking is reshaping modern defense strategies, enhancing secure data exchange, real-time situational awareness, and autonomous decision-making. This survey explores how AI-driven technologies improve tactical communication networks, radar-based data transmission, UAV-assisted relay systems, and electronic warfare resilience. The study highlights AI applications in adaptive signal processing, multi-agent coordination for network optimization, radar-assisted target tracking, and AI-driven electronic countermeasures. Our work introduces a novel three-criteria evaluation methodology. It systematically assesses AI applications based on general system objectives, communications constraints in the military domain, and critical tactical environmental factors. We analyze key AI techniques for different types of learning applied to multi-domain network interoperability and distributed data information fusion in military operations. We also address challenges such as adversarial AI threats, the real-time adaptability of autonomous communication networks, and the limitations of current AI models under battlefield conditions. Finally, we discuss emerging trends in self-healing networks, AI-augmented decision support systems, and intelligent spectrum allocation. We provide a structured roadmap for future AI-driven defense communications and networking research.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Coexistence of Autonomous Vehicles with Human-Driven Traffic at Signalized Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has positioned mixed traffic environments, which encompass both CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs), as critical components of emerging mobility systems. Signalized intersections are paramount for optimizing transportation efficiency and enhancing energy economy, as they inherently induce stop and go traffic dynamics. In this paper, we present an integrated framework that concurrently optimizes signal timing and CAV trajectories at signalized intersections, with the dual objectives of maximizing traffic throughput and minimizing energy consumption for CAVs. We first formulate an optimal control strategy for CAVs that prioritizes trajectory planning to circumvent state constraints, while incorporating the impact of signal timing and HDV behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a traffic signal control methodology that dynamically adjusts signal phases based on vehicular density per lane, while mitigating disruption for CAVs scheduled to traverse the intersection. Acknowledging the system's inherent dynamism, we also explore event triggered replanning mechanisms that enable CAVs to iteratively refine their planned trajectories in response to the emergence of more efficient routing options. The efficacy of our proposed framework is evaluated through comprehensive simulations in MATLAB.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Communication of Distributed Model Predictive Control: Autoencoders and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication remains a key factor limiting the applicability of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) in realistic settings, despite advances in wireless communication. DMPC schemes can require an overwhelming amount of information exchange between agents as the amount of data depends on the length of the predication horizon, for which some applications require a significant length to formally guarantee nominal asymptotic stability. This work aims to provide an approach to reduce the communication effort of DMPC by reducing the size of the communicated data between agents. Using an autoencoder, the communicated data is reduced by the encoder part of the autoencoder prior to communication and reconstructed by the decoder part upon reception within the distributed optimization algorithm that constitutes the DMPC scheme. The choice of a learning-based reduction method is motivated by structure inherent to the data, which results from the data's connection to solutions of optimal control problems. The approach is implemented and tested at the example of formation control of differential-drive robots, which is challenging for optimization-based control due to the robots' nonholonomic constraints, and which is interesting due to the practical importance of mobile robotics. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented first in form of a simulative analysis showing that the resulting control performance yields a satisfactory accuracy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms the canonical naive way to reduce communication by reducing the length of the prediction horizon. Moreover, it is shown that numerical experiments conducted on embedded computation hardware, with real distributed computation and wireless communication, work well with the proposed way of reducing communication even in practical scenarios in which full communication fails.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Heat Transfer Coefficient in Heat Exchangers from closed-loop data using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat exchangers (HEXs) play a central role in process industries for thermal energy transfer. Fouling, the gradual accumulation of solids on heat transfer surfaces, causes a time-varying decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient (U(t)), significantly impacting the efficiency of heat transfer. Good estimation and modeling of fouling (the heat transfer coefficient) will lead to better fouling mitigation strategies. This study investigates the identifiability of the time-varying $U(t)$ in HEXs from closed-loop operational data, without external excitation of reference signals or knowledge of the controller parameters. We establish that while the complete system model cannot be identified under these given constraints, the time-varying heat transfer coefficient $U(t)$ remains identifiable. Further, we propose a neural network based architecture, called (Per-PINN), for estimation and modeling the heat transfer coefficient from the closed-loop system data. This Per-PINN model is shown to perform better than the existing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) based models for inverse parameter learning as it inherently fixes the underlying physical equations and learns only the time-varying parameter U(t).</description>

      <title>Self-Learning-Based Optimization for Free-form Pipe Routing in Aeroengine with Dynamic Design Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pipe routing is a highly complex, time-consuming, and no-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem in aeroengine design. Despite extensive research efforts in optimizing constant-curvature pipe routing, the growing demand for free-form pipes poses new challenges. Dynamic design environments and fuzzy layout rules further impact the optimization performance and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a self-learning-based method (SLPR) for optimizing free-form pipe routing in aeroengines. The SLPR is based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and integrates a unified rule modeling framework for efficient obstacle detection and fuzzy rule modeling in continuous space. Additionally, a potential energy table is constructed to enable rapid queries of layout tendencies and interference. The agent within SLPR iteratively refines pipe routing and accumulates the design knowledge through interaction with the environment. Once the design environment shifts, the agent can swiftly adapt by fine-tuning network parameters. Comparative tests reveal that SLPR ensures smooth pipe routing through cubic non-uniform B-spline (NURBS) curves, avoiding redundant pipe segments found in constant-curvature pipe routing. Results in both static and dynamic design environments demonstrate that SLPR outperforms three representative baselines in terms of the pipe length reduction, the adherence to layout rules, the path complexity, and the computational efficiency. Furthermore, tests in dynamic environments indicate that SLPR eliminates labor-intensive searches from scratch and even yields superior solutions compared to the retrained model. These results highlight the practical value of SLPR for real-world pipe routing, meeting lightweight, precision, and sustainability requirements of the modern aeroengine design.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale lithium-ion battery capacity prediction using mixture of experts and patch-based MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-ion battery health management has become increasingly important as the application of batteries expands. Precise forecasting of capacity degradation is critical for ensuring the healthy usage of batteries. In this paper, we innovatively propose MSPMLP, a multi-scale capacity prediction model utilizing the mixture of experts (MoE) architecture and patch-based multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks, to capture both the long-term degradation trend and local capacity regeneration phenomena. Specifically, we utilize patch-based MLP blocks with varying patch sizes to extract multi-scale features from the capacity sequence. Leveraging the MoE architecture, the model adaptively integrates the extracted features, thereby enhancing its capacity and expressiveness. Finally, the future battery capacity is predicted based on the integrated features, achieving high prediction accuracy and generalization. Experimental results on the public NASA dataset indicate that MSPMLP achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0078, improving by 41.8\% compared to existing methods. These findings highlight that MSPMLP, owing to its multi-scale modeling capability and generalizability, provides a promising solution to the battery capacity prediction challenges caused by capacity regeneration phenomena and complex usage conditions.

      <title>Using Mobile Relays to Strongly Connect a Minimum-Power Network between Terminals Complying with No-Transmission Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present strategies for placing a swarm of mobile relays to provide a bi-directional wireless network that connects fixed (immobile) terminals. Neither terminals nor relays are permitted to transmit into disk-shaped no-transmission zones. We assume a planar environment and that each transmission area is a disk centered at the transmitter. We seek a strongly connected network between all terminals with minimal total cost, where the cost is the sum area of the transmission disks. Results for networks with increasing levels of complexity are provided. The solutions for local networks containing low numbers of relays and terminals are applied to larger networks. For more complex networks, algorithms for a minimum-spanning tree (MST) based procedure are implemented to reduce the solution cost. A procedure to characterize and determine the possible homotopies of a system of terminals and obstacles is described, and used to initialize the evolution of the network under the presented algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Exploration-free Method for a Linear Stochastic Bandit Driven by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stochastic multi-armed bandits, a major problem the learner faces is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Recently, exploration-free methods -- methods that commit to the action predicted to return the highest reward -- have been studied from the perspective of linear bandits. In this paper, we introduce a linear bandit setting where the reward is the output of a linear Gaussian dynamical system. Motivated by a problem encountered in hyperparameter optimization for reinforcement learning, where the number of actions is much higher than the number of training iterations, we propose Kalman filter Observability Dependent Exploration (KODE), an exploration-free method that utilizes the Kalman filter predictions to select actions. Our major contribution of this work is our analysis of the performance of the proposed method, which is dependent on the observability properties of the underlying linear Gaussian dynamical system. We evaluate KODE via two different metrics: regret, which is the cumulative expected difference between the highest possible reward and the reward sampled by KODE, and action alignment, which measures how closely KODE's chosen action aligns with the linear Gaussian dynamical system's state variable. To provide intuition on the performance, we prove that KODE implicitly encourages the learner to explore actions depending on the observability of the linear Gaussian dynamical system. This method is compared to several well-known stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithms to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Improving Offline Mixed-Criticality Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The use of robots in disaster sites has rapidly expanded, with soft robots attracting particular interest due to their flexibility and adaptability. They can navigate through narrow spaces and debris, facilitating efficient and safe operations. However, low visibility in such environments remains a challenge. This study aims to enhance the visibility of soft robots by developing and evaluating a passive luminescent exible actuator activated by a black light. Using Ecoex mixed with phosphorescent powder, we fabricated an actuator and confirmed its fluorescence phosphorescence and deformation ability. Furthermore the effects of the mixing ratio on optical and mechanical properties were assessed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of self-driving cars has garnered significant attention from researchers, universities, and industries worldwide. Autonomous vehicles integrate numerous subsystems, including lane tracking, object detection, and vehicle control, which require thorough testing and validation. Scaled-down vehicles offer a cost-effective and accessible platform for experimentation, providing researchers with opportunities to optimize algorithms under constraints of limited computational power. This paper presents a four-wheeled autonomous vehicle platform designed to facilitate research and prototyping in autonomous driving. Key contributions include (1) a novel density-based clustering approach utilizing histogram statistics for landmark tracking, (2) a lateral controller, and (3) the integration of these innovations into a cohesive platform. Additionally, the paper explores object detection through systematic dataset augmentation and introduces an autonomous parking procedure. The results demonstrate the platform's effectiveness in achieving reliable lane tracking under varying lighting conditions, smooth trajectory following, and consistent object detection performance. Though developed for small-scale vehicles, these modular solutions are adaptable for full-scale autonomous systems, offering a versatile and cost-efficient framework for advancing research and industry applications.</description>

Abstract: This report is a compilation of technical knowledge and concepts that were produced by the authors and additional contributors in the context of the collaboration projects "Abstraction Requirements for Language of Choice in Industrial Automation" (FY21-22) and "Approaches for Robust and Safe Low-Code" (FY23-24) from Siemens Technology and the University of California, Berkeley. The primary objective of these projects was to assess Siemens Open Industrial Edge (OIE) engineering capabilities by defining a concept that ensures the satisfaction of coordination and safety requirements when using disparate OIE modules. The objective was to use the Lingua Franca (LF) coordination language to demonstrate how to address challenges in: 1. engineering modular, distributed, and flexible automation solutions that ensure, by design, robust and safe operation1; 2. the use of IEC 61499, the event driven execution model for specifying the execution order of OIE modules (defined as function blocks); 3. support large-scale distributed OIE automation solutions, and eventually 4. define optimal solutions with synchronization and time-optimal mechanisms.</description>

      <title>From Automation to Autonomy in Smart Manufacturing: A Bayesian Optimization Framework for Modeling Multi-Objective Experimentation and Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering novel materials with desired properties is essential for driving innovation. Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing have promised transformative advances in this area through real-time data integration and automated production planning and control. However, the reliance on automation alone has often fallen short, lacking the flexibility needed for complex processes. To fully unlock the potential of smart manufacturing, we must evolve from automation to autonomous systems that go beyond rigid programming and can dynamically optimize the search for solutions. Current discovery approaches are often slow, requiring numerous trials to find optimal combinations, and costly, particularly when optimizing multiple properties simultaneously. This paper proposes a Bayesian multi-objective sequential decision-making (BMSDM) framework that can intelligently select experiments as manufacturing progresses, guiding us toward the discovery of optimal design faster and more efficiently. The framework leverages sequential learning through Bayesian Optimization, which iteratively refines a statistical model representing the underlying manufacturing process. This statistical model acts as a surrogate, allowing for efficient exploration and optimization without requiring numerous real-world experiments. This approach can significantly reduce the time and cost of data collection required by traditional experimental designs. The proposed framework is compared with traditional DoE methods and two other multi-objective optimization methods. Using a manufacturing dataset, we evaluate and compare the performance of these approaches across five evaluation metrics. BMSDM comprehensively outperforms the competing methods in multi-objective decision-making scenarios. Our proposed approach represents a significant leap forward in creating an intelligent autonomous platform capable of novel material discovery.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Learning Approach with Differentiable Optimization for UAV Trajectory Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant traction across various fields, path planning in 3D environments remains a critical challenge, particularly under size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. Traditional modular planning systems often introduce latency and suboptimal performance due to limited information sharing and local minima issues. End-to-end learning approaches streamline the pipeline by mapping sensory observations directly to actions but require large-scale datasets, face significant sim-to-real gaps, or lack dynamical feasibility. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised UAV trajectory planning pipeline that integrates a learning-based depth perception with differentiable trajectory optimization. A 3D cost map guides UAV behavior without expert demonstrations or human labels. Additionally, we incorporate a neural network-based time allocation strategy to improve the efficiency and optimality. The system thus combines robust learning-based perception with reliable physics-based optimization for improved generalizability and interpretability. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate our approach across various environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our method achieves a 31.33% improvement in position tracking error and 49.37% reduction in control effort compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>AI in a vat: Fundamental limits of efficient world modelling for agent sandboxing and interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work proposes using world models to generate controlled virtual environments in which AI agents can be tested before deployment to ensure their reliability and safety. However, accurate world models often have high computational demands that can severely restrict the scope and depth of such assessments. Inspired by the classic `brain in a vat' thought experiment, here we investigate ways of simplifying world models that remain agnostic to the AI agent under evaluation. By following principles from computational mechanics, our approach reveals a fundamental trade-off in world model construction between efficiency and interpretability, demonstrating that no single world model can optimise all desirable characteristics. Building on this trade-off, we identify procedures to build world models that either minimise memory requirements, delineate the boundaries of what is learnable, or allow tracking causes of undesirable outcomes. In doing so, this work establishes fundamental limits in world modelling, leading to actionable guidelines that inform core design choices related to effective agent evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous Approach for Training Neural Differential-Algebraic Systems of Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning is an emerging field that broadly describes the combination of scientific computing and machine learning to address challenges in science and engineering. Within the context of differential equations, this has produced highly influential methods, such as neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). Recent works extend this line of research to consider neural differential-algebraic systems of equations (DAEs), where some unknown relationships within the DAE are learned from data. Training neural DAEs, similarly to neural ODEs, is computationally expensive, as it requires the solution of a DAE for every parameter update. Further, the rigorous consideration of algebraic constraints is difficult within common deep learning training algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent. In this work, we apply the simultaneous approach to neural DAE problems, resulting in a fully discretized nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved to local optimality and simultaneously obtains the neural network parameters and the solution to the corresponding DAE. We extend recent work demonstrating the simultaneous approach for neural ODEs, by presenting a general framework to solve neural DAEs, with explicit consideration of hybrid models, where some components of the DAE are known, e.g. physics-informed constraints. Furthermore, we present a general strategy for improving the performance and convergence of the nonlinear programming solver, based on solving an auxiliary problem for initialization and approximating Hessian terms. We achieve promising results in terms of accuracy, model generalizability and computational cost, across different problem settings such as sparse data, unobserved states and multiple trajectories. Lastly, we provide several promising future directions to improve the scalability and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization of Stochastic Systems under Chance Constraints via Set Erosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trajectory optimization problem under chance constraints for continuous-time stochastic systems. To address chance constraints imposed on the entire stochastic trajectory, we propose a framework based on the set erosion strategy, which converts the chance constraints into safety constraints on an eroded subset of the safe set along the corresponding deterministic trajectory. The depth of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between the stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart, for which we utilize a novel and sharp probabilistic bound developed recently. By adopting this framework, a deterministic control input sequence can be obtained, whose feasibility and performance are demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Our framework is compatible with various deterministic optimal control techniques, offering great flexibility and computational efficiency in a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the first scalable trajectory optimization scheme for high-dimensional stochastic systems under trajectory level chance constraints. We validate the proposed method through two numerical experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose SILVIA (Space Interferometer Laboratory Voyaging towards Innovative Applications), a mission concept designed to demonstrate ultra-precision formation flying between three spacecraft separated by 100 m. SILVIA aims to achieve sub-micrometer precision in relative distance control by integrating spacecraft sensors, laser interferometry, low-thrust and low-noise micro-propulsion for real-time measurement and control of distances and relative orientations between spacecraft. A 100-meter-scale mission in a near-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective setting for demonstrating SILVIA, as this configuration maintains a good balance between small relative perturbations and low risk for collision. This mission will fill the current technology gap towards future missions, including gravitational wave observatories such as DECIGO (DECihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory), designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave background, and high-contrast nulling infrared interferometers like LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets), designed for direct imaging of thermal emissions from nearby terrestrial planet candidates. The mission concept and its key technologies are outlined, paving the way for the next generation of high-precision space-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Supermartingale Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general methodology for quantitative model checking and control synthesis with supermartingale certificates. We show that every specification that is invariant to time shifts admits a stochastic invariant that bounds its probability from below; for systems with general state space, the stochastic invariant bounds this probability as closely as desired; for systems with finite state space, it quantifies it exactly. Our result enables the extension of every certificate for the almost-sure satisfaction of shift-invariant specifications to its quantitative counterpart, ensuring completeness up to an approximation in the general case and exactness in the finite-state case. This generalises and unifies existing supermartingale certificates for quantitative verification and control under reachability, safety, reach-avoidance, and stability specifications, as well as asymptotic bounds on accrued costs and rewards. Furthermore, our result provides the first supermartingale certificate for computing upper and lower bounds on the probability of satisfying $\omega$-regular and linear temporal logic specifications. We present an algorithm for quantitative $\omega$-regular verification and control synthesis based on our method and demonstrate its practical efficacy on several infinite-state examples.</description>

      <title>Entropy Rate Maximization of Markov Decision Processes under Linear Temporal Logic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of synthesizing optimal control policies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with both qualitative and quantitative objectives. Specifically, our goal is to achieve a given linear temporal logic (LTL) task with probability one, while maximizing the \emph{entropy rate} of the system. The notion of entropy rate characterizes the long-run average (un)predictability of a stochastic process. Such an optimal policy is of our interest, in particular, from the security point of view, as it not only ensures the completion of tasks, but also maximizes the unpredictability of the system. However, existing works only focus on maximizing the total entropy which may diverge to infinity for infinite horizon. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL constraints. Specifically, we first present an algorithm for synthesizing entropy rate maximizing policies for communicating MDPs. Then based on a new state classification method, we show the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL task can be effectively solved in polynomial-time. We illustrate the proposed algorithm based on two case studies of robot task planning scenario.</description>

      <title>Recursive Dynamic State Estimation for Power Systems with an Incomplete Nonlinear DAE Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power systems are highly complex, large-scale engineering systems subject to many uncertainties, which makes accurate mathematical modeling challenging. This paper proposes a novel, centralized dynamic state estimator for power systems that lack models of some components. Including the available dynamic evolution equations, algebraic network equations, and phasor measurements, we apply the least squares criterion to estimate all dynamic and algebraic states recursively. The approach results in an algorithm that generalizes the iterated extended Kalman filter and does not require static network observability. We further derive a graph theoretic condition for placing phasor measurement units that guarantees the uniqueness of the solution. A numerical study evaluates the performance under short circuits in the network and load changes and shows superior tracking performance compared to robust procedures from the literature within computational times that are feasible for real-time application.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reduced order modeling of a nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The resulting nonsmooth boundary conditions can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. The system is modeled as piecewise linear with different boundary conditions determining different regions of a hybrid phase space. With kick strength as parameter, its bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to estimate the system's intrinsic dimensionality. However, conventional POD's purely statistical analysis of spatial covariance does not guarantee accuracy of reduced order models (ROMs). We therefore augment POD by employing a previously-developed energy closure criterion that selects ROM dimension by ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This physics-based criterion yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated at particular values of the kick strength can nevertheless reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original nonlinear structural system. We thus show that energy closure analysis reliably yields effective dimension estimates and, thereby, ROMs that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Finite-Time Analysis of Suboptimal Online Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suboptimal methods in optimal control arise due to a limited computational budget, unknown system dynamics, or a short prediction window among other reasons. Although these methods are ubiquitous, their transient performance remains relatively unstudied. We consider the control of discrete-time, nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and establish sufficient conditions to analyze the finite-time closed-loop performance of such methods in terms of the additional cost incurred due to suboptimality. Finite-time guarantees allow the control design to distribute a limited computational budget over a time horizon and estimate the on-the-go loss in performance due to suboptimality. We study exponential incremental input-to-state stabilizing policies and show that for nonlinear systems, under some mild conditions, this property is directly implied by exponential stability without further assumptions on global smoothness. The analysis is showcased on a suboptimal model predictive control use case.</description>

      <title>Sampled-Data Primal-Dual Gradient Dynamics in Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a versatile approach capable of accommodating diverse control requirements that holds significant promise for a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Noteworthy challenges associated with MPC include the substantial computational burden, which is sometimes considered excessive even for linear systems. Recently, a rapid computation method that guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing primal-dual gradient (PDG) dynamics as a controller has been proposed for linear MPCs. However, stability has been ensured under the assumption that the controller is a continuous-time system, leading to potential instability when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller, incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach, and present stability conditions relevant to the resulting sampled-data system. Additionally, we introduce an extension designed to enhance control performance, that was traded off in the original. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method, which can be executed in only 1 $\mu$s in a standard laptop, not only ensures stability with considering sampled-data implementation but also effectively enhances control performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new data-driven control for multi-input, multi-output nonlinear systems with partially unknown dynamics and bounded disturbances. Since exact nonlinearity cancellation is not feasible with unknown disturbances, we adapt sliding mode control (SMC) for system stability and robustness. The SMC features a data-driven robust controller to reach the sliding surface and a data-driven nominal controller from a semidefinite program (SDP) to ensure stability. Simulations show the proposed method outperforms existing data-driven approaches with approximate nonlinearity cancellation.</description>

      <title>Aggregator of Electric Vehicles Bidding in Nordic FCR-D Markets: A Chance-Constrained Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12818v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Danish system operator, Energinet, has recently introduced an innovative grid code called the P90 requirement, which allows stochastic flexible resources to bid their flexibility in Nordic ancillary service markets, contingent upon a minimum 90\% probability of successfully realizing the reserve capacity bid. For limited-energy resources, Energinet imposes additional requirements for participation in these markets. Given these requirements, this paper presents a chance-constrained optimization model designed for aggregators of electric vehicles, aiming to optimally place reserve capacity bids in the Nordic Frequency Containment Reserve for Disturbances (FCR-D) market while accounting for uncertainty in future consumption baselines. We analyze both FCR-D up and down markets, reformulating and solving the proposed joint chance-constrained model using two sample-based methods. Using real data from 1400 charging stations in Denmark from March 2022 to March 2023, we demonstrate the out-of-sample profit potential. Our findings indicate that vehicle owners could save between 6\% and 10\% on their annual electricity bills by providing FCR-D services. Additionally, we observed a synergy effect, where having more vehicles in a single portfolio enables larger bids per vehicle compared to a collective bid from multiple portfolios with the same total number of vehicles.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Control of Disturbed Interconnected Systems with High-Order Tuners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of network synchronization under limited communication, involving heterogeneous agents with different dynamics and various network topologies, to achieve consensus. We investigate the distributed adaptive control for interconnected unknown linear subsystems with a leader and followers, in the presence of input-output disturbance. We enhance the communication within multi-agent systems to achieve consensus under the leadership's guidance. While the measured variable is similar among the followers, the incoming measurements are weighted and constructed based on their proximity to the leader. We also explore the convergence rates across various balanced topologies (Star-like, Cyclic-like, Path, Random), featuring different numbers of agents, using three distributed algorithms, ranging from first- to high-order tuners to effectively address time-varying regressors. The mathematical foundation is rigorously presented from the network designs of the unknown agents following a leader, to the distributed methods. Moreover, we conduct several numerical simulations across various networks, agents and tuners to evaluate the effects of sparsity in the interaction between subsystems using the $L_2-$norm and $L_\infty-$norm. Some networks exhibit a trend where an increasing number of agents results in smaller errors, although this is not universally the case. Additionally, patterns observed at initial times may not reliably predict overall performance across different networks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed modified high-order tuner outperforms its counterparts, and we provide related insights along with our conclusions.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of safe stabilization, ensuring the system state reach the origin while avoiding unsafe regions. Existing approaches relying on smooth Lyapunov barrier functions often fail to guarantee a feasible controller. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the nonsmooth Control Lyapunov Barrier Function (NCLBF), which ensures the existence of a safe and stabilizing controller. We provide a systematic framework for designing NCLBF and feedback control strategies to achieve safe stabilization in the presence of multiple bounded unsafe regions. Theoretical analysis and simulations of both linear and nonlinear systems demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to the existing smooth functions method.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurate pose estimation-position, velocity, and orientation-of a rigid body using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in combination with generic exteroceptive measurements. By reformulating the vehicle's dynamics and measurement models within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework, we enable the application of a linear Kalman filter, significantly simplifying observer design for inertial navigation systems (INS). A key strength of this approach lies in its generality: rather than relying on specific measurement modalities, our framework accommodates a broad class of exteroceptive measurements. To illustrate its effectiveness, we conduct a uniform observability (UO) analysis for two fundamental benchmark cases-GPS-aided INS and landmark-aided INS-deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee the global uniform exponential stability of the proposed filter. Simulations for both applications confirm the versatility and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. The state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP) model for this problem relies on specific functions and global constraints only available in a well established commercial CP solver. This paper expands the literature around this problem by proposing four new CP models that can be implemented in commercial and open-source solvers: a new model that relies on automaton constraints, and three alternative models that integrate assignment and scheduling decisions with different strategies and global constraints. Extensive computational experiments on standard test cases under multiple objectives and multiple solvers demonstrate the implementation flexibility and competitive performance of the proposed models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articulated Frame Steering (AFS) vehicles are widely used in heavy-duty industries, where they often operate near operators and laborers. Therefore, designing safe controllers for AFS vehicles is essential. In this paper, we develop a Quadratic Program (QP)-based safety filter that ensures feasibility for AFS vehicles with affine actuator dynamics. To achieve this, we first derive the general equations of motion for AFS vehicles, incorporating affine actuator dynamics. We then introduce a novel High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) candidate with equal relative degrees for both system controls. Finally, we design a Parametric Adaptive HOCBF (PACBF) and an always-feasible, QP-based safety filter. Numerical simulations of AFS vehicle kinematics demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disturbance rejection in high-precision control applications can be significantly improved upon via online convex optimization (OCO). This includes classical techniques such as recursive least squares (RLS) and more recent, regret-based formulations. However, these methods can cause instabilities in the presence of model uncertainty. This paper introduces a safety filter for systems with OCO in the form of adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filtering to ensure robust disturbance rejection. The safety filter enforces a robust stability constraint on the FIR coefficients while minimally altering the OCO command in the $\infty$-norm cost. Additionally, we show that the induced $\ell_\infty$-norm allows for easy online implementation of the safety filter by directly limiting the OCO command. The constraint can be tuned to trade off robustness and performance. We provide a simple example to demonstrate the safety filter.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Robustness and Fragility of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Role of the DSO in Electricity Trading of VPPs via a Stackelberg Game Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources has sparked interests in participating in power markets. Here, we consider two settings where Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) with some flexible resources participate in the electricity trading, either directly in the wholesale electricity market, or interfaced by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) who is the transaction organizer. In order to study the role of DSO as a stakeholder, a Stackelberg game is represented via a bi-level model: the DSO maximizes profits at the upper level, while the VPPs minimize operating costs at the lower level. To solve this problem, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of lower level is deduced to achieve a single-level problem. The results show that the role of the DSO as an intermediary agent leads to a decrease in operating costs of the VPPs by organizing lower-level trading, while making a profit for itself. However, this result comes with interests loss of the wholesale market, implying that stakeholders in the market need to abide by regulatory constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest advancements and near-future trends in automotive battery packs, underlying regulatory compliance, and performance requirements are presented in this paper. In response to these specifications, high-level solutions that converge towards a standard architecture for passenger cars are provided. Transition to high-voltage enables ultra-fast charging above 350 kW, which reduces the charging times to less than 20 minutes. Also, advances in energy density and battery capacities make advancements in enhancing the electric vehicle's range beyond 1000 km per charge. Key factors such as electrical performance, safety, mechanical integrity, reliability, endurance, environmental conditions, and diagnostics are examined. This study explores the next generation of cost-effective and high-performance battery systems and discovers near-future battery technologies, including sodium-ion chemistry and rare-earth-free alternatives, as well as battery applications in aviation.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Distributed Energy Resources with Nodal Pricing in Distribution Networks: a Game-Theoretic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a real-time nodal pricing mechanism for cost minimization and voltage control in a distribution network with autonomous distributed energy resources and analyze the resulting market using stochastic game theory. Unlike existing methods, the proposed pricing scheme does not require device-aware centralized coordination or communication between prosumers. By developing new sufficient conditions under which a stochastic game is a Markov potential game, we show that the problem of computing an equilibrium for the proposed model is equivalent to solving a single-agent Markov Decision Process. These new conditions are general and may apply to other applications. We compute the equilibrium for an IEEE test system to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the pricing policy.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning for building performance simulation-A review of a nascent field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building performance simulation (BPS) is critical for understanding building dynamics and behavior, analyzing performance of the built environment, optimizing energy efficiency, improving demand flexibility, and enhancing building resilience. However, conducting BPS is not trivial. Traditional BPS relies on an accurate building energy model, mostly physics-based, which depends heavily on detailed building information, expert knowledge, and case-by-case model calibrations, thereby significantly limiting their scalability. With the development of sensing technology and increased data availability, there is a growing attention and interest in data-driven BPS. However, purely data-driven models often suffer from limited generalization ability and a lack of physical consistency, resulting in poor performance in real-world applications. To address these limitations, recent studies have started to incorporate physics priors into data-driven models, a methodology called physics-informed machine learning (PIML). PIML is an emerging field with the definitions, methodologies, evaluation criteria, application scenarios, and future directions that remain open. To bridge those gaps, this study systematically reviews the state-of-art PIML for BPS, offering a comprehensive definition of PIML, and comparing it to traditional BPS approaches regarding data requirements, modeling effort, performance and computation cost. We also summarize the commonly used methodologies, validation approaches, application domains, available data sources, open-source packages and testbeds. In addition, this study provides a general guideline for selecting appropriate PIML models based on BPS applications. Finally, this study identifies key challenges and outlines future research directions, providing a solid foundation and valuable insights to advance R&amp;D of PIML in BPS.</description>

      <title>Lambda/6 Suspended Patch Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel, compact antenna design based on a lambda-6th suspended patch configuration that is particularly suited for small-size wireless sensor nodes. The proposed design meets key requirements such as compactness, omnidirectionality, robust source matching over a designated bandwidth, interference immunity, and low costs by evolving the conventional square patch antenna. With a footprint of only 20-by-20 mm, the antenna incorporates a grounded metal shield to both reduce its effective dimensions below one-half wavelength and mitigate interference from nearby circuitry. Simulation results, conducted on a cost-effective FR4 substrate, demonstrate a resonance at 2.45 GHz with a return loss of -32.5 dB and a bandwidth of 50 MHz (at the -10 dB level), making this design an attractive candidate for integration into densely populated wireless sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Self-triggered Stabilization of Contracting Systems under Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose self-triggered control schemes for nonlinear systems with quantized state measurements. Our focus lies on scenarios where both the controller and the self-triggering mechanism receive only the quantized state at each sampling time. We assume that the ideal closed-loop system without quantization or self-triggered sampling is contracting. Moreover, an upper bound on the growth rate of the open-loop system is assumed to be known. We present two control schemes that achieve closed-loop stability without Zeno behavior. The first scheme is implemented under logarithmic quantization and uses the quantized state for the threshold in the triggering condition. The second one is a joint design of zooming quantization and self-triggered sampling, where the adjustable zoom parameter for quantization changes based on inter-sampling times and is also used for the threshold of self-triggered sampling. In both schemes, the self-triggering mechanism predicts the future state from the quantized data for the computation of the next sampling time. We employ a trajectory-based approach for stability analysis, where contraction theory plays a key role.</description>

      <title>Distributed Stochastic Bilevel Optimization: Improved Complexity and Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper consider solving a class of nonconvex-strongly-convex distributed stochastic bilevel optimization (DSBO) problems with personalized inner-level objectives. Most existing algorithms require computational loops for hypergradient estimation, leading to computational inefficiency. Moreover, the impact of data heterogeneity on convergence in bilevel problems is not explicitly characterized yet. To address these issues, we propose LoPA, a loopless personalized distributed algorithm that leverages a tracking mechanism for iterative approximation of inner-level solutions and Hessian-inverse matrices without relying on extra computation loops. Our theoretical analysis explicitly characterizes the heterogeneity across nodes (denoted by $b$), and establishes a sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}( {\frac{1}{{{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}K}} \!+ \!\frac{{(\frac{b}{\sqrt{m}})^{\frac{2}{3}} }}{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} K^{\frac{2}{3}} }} \!+ \!\frac{1}{\sqrt{ K }}( {\sigma _{\operatorname{p} }} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}{\sigma _{\operatorname{c} }} ) } )$ without the boundedness of local hypergradients, where ${\sigma _{\operatorname{p} }}$ and ${\sigma _{\operatorname{c} }}$ represent the gradient sampling variances associated with the inner- and outer-level variables, respectively. We also integrate LoPA with a gradient tracking scheme to eliminate the impact of data heterogeneity, yielding an improved rate of ${{\mathcal{O}}}(\frac{{1}}{{ (1-\rho)^2K }} \!+\! \frac{1}{{\sqrt{K}}}( \sigma_{\rm{p}} \!+\! \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\sigma_{\rm{c}} ) )$. The computational complexity of LoPA is of ${{\mathcal{O}}}({\epsilon^{-2}})$ to an $\epsilon$-stationary point, matching the communication complexity due to the loopless structure, which outperforms existing counterparts for DSBO. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Wheel Loader Navigation Using Goal-Conditioned Actor-Critic MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control method for an autonomous wheel loader, enabling time-efficient navigation to an arbitrary goal pose. Unlike prior works which combine high-level trajectory planners with Model Predictive Control (MPC), we directly enhance the planning capabilities of MPC by incorporating a cost function derived from Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we first train an RL agent to solve the pose reaching task in simulation, then transfer the learned planning knowledge to an MPC by incorporating the trained neural network critic as both the stage and terminal cost. We show through comprehensive simulations that the resulting MPC inherits the time-efficient behavior of the RL agent, generating trajectories that compare favorably against those found using trajectory optimization. We also deploy our method on a real-world wheel loader, where we demonstrate successful navigation in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation in Unmapped Environments for Robotic Systems with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for navigation and control in unmapped environments under input and state constraints using a composite control barrier function (CBF). We consider the scenario where real-time perception feedback (e.g., LiDAR) is used online to construct a local CBF that models local state constraints (e.g., local safety constraints such as obstacles) in the a priori unmapped environment. The approach employs a soft-maximum function to synthesize a single time-varying CBF from the N most recently obtained local CBFs. Next, the input constraints are transformed into controller-state constraints through the use of control dynamics. Then, we use a soft-minimum function to compose the input constraints with the time-varying CBF that models the a priori unmapped environment. This composition yields a single relaxed CBF, which is used in a constrained optimization to obtain an optimal control that satisfies the state and input constraints. The approach is validated through simulations of a nonholonomic ground robot that is equipped with LiDAR and navigates an unmapped environment. The robot successfully navigates the environment while avoiding the a priori unmapped obstacles and satisfying both speed and input constraints.</description>

      <title>CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17648v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.

      <title>CODEI: Resource-Efficient Task-Driven Co-Design of Perception and Decision Making for Mobile Robots Applied to Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the integration challenges and strategies for designing mobile robots, by focusing on the task-driven, optimal selection of hardware and software to balance safety, efficiency, and minimal usage of resources such as costs, energy, computational requirements, and weight. We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social learning provides a fundamental framework in economics and social sciences for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting both theoretically and through numerical simulations, showing that some agents benefit from using the public belief broadcast by the last agent, while others suffer from performance deterioration.</description>
