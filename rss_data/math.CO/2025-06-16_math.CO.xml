      <title>On Topological Indices in Trees: Fibonacci Degree Sequences and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied bounds based on topological indicators, from which we selected Albertson index $\mathrm{irr}$ and the Sigma index $\sigma$. The Sigma index was defined through the following relationship: \[ \sigma(G)=\sum_{uv\in E(G)}\left( d_u(G)-d_v(G) \right)^2. \]
  We establish a precise formula for the Albertson index of a tree $T$ of order $n$ with a Fibonacci degree sequence $\mathscr{D} = (F_3, \dots, F_n)$. Additionally, we derive bounds for the minimum and maximum Albertson indices ($\irr_{\min}$ and $\irr_{\max}$) across various tree structures. Propositions and lemmas provide upper and lower bounds, incorporating parameters such as the maximum degree $ \Delta$, minimum degree $\delta$. We further relate the Albertson index to the second Zagreb index $M_2(T)$ and the forgotten index $F(T)$, establishing a new upper bound.</description>

      <title>Social Networks: Enumerating Maximal Community Patterns in $c$-Closed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fox, Seshadhri, Roughgarden, Wei, and Wein (SICOMP 2020) introduced the model of $c$-closed graphs--a distribution-free model motivated by triadic closure, one of the most pervasive structural signatures of social networks. While enumerating maximal cliques in general graphs can take exponential time, it is known that in $c$-closed graphs, maximal cliques and maximal complete bipartite subgraphs can always be enumerated in polynomial time. These structures correspond to blow-ups of simple patterns: a single vertex or a single edge, with some vertices required to form cliques. In this work, we explore a natural extension: we study maximal blow-ups of arbitrary finite graphs $H$ in $c$-closed graphs. We prove that for any fixed graph $H$, the number of maximal blow-ups of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $c$-closed graph is always bounded by a polynomial in $n$. We further investigate the case of induced blow-ups and provide a precise characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the number of maximal induced blow-ups is also polynomially bounded in $n$. Finally, we study the analogue questions when $H$ ranges over an infinite family of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduce a new type of partitions where the largest part appears exactly once, and the remaining parts constitute a partition of that largest part. We derive the generating function associated with these partitions and subsequently explore several variations, providing the corresponding generating functions for each variant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we outline a new and simple approach to proving central limit theorems for various 'global' graph parameters which have robust 'local' approximations, using the Efron--Stein inequality, which relies on a combinatorial analysis of the stability of these approximations under resampling an edge. As an application, we give short proofs of a central limit theorem for the order of the giant component and of the $k$-core for sparse random graphs.</description>

      <title>2-reachable subsets in two-colored graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $X$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a {\em diameter 2 subset} if the distance of any two vertices of $X$ is at most two {\em in $G[X]$}. Relaxing this notion, a subset $X$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a {\em 2-reachable subset} if the distance of any two vertices of $X$ is at most two {\em in $G$}. Related to recent attempts to strengthen a well-known conjecture of Ryser, English et al. conjectured that the vertices of a $2$-edge-colored cocktail party graph (the graph obtained from a complete graph with an even number of vertices by deleting a perfect matching) can be covered by the vertices of two monochromatic diameter $2$ subsets. In this note we prove the relaxed form of this conjecture, replacing diameter $2$ by $2$-reachable. An immediate corollary is that $2$-colored cocktail party graphs on $n$ vertices must contain a monochromatic $2$-reachable subset with at least $n\over 2$ vertices (and this is best possible).</description>

      <title>Thrackles on nonplanar surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thrackle is a drawing of a graph on a surface such that (i) adjacent edges only intersect at their common vertex; and (ii) nonadjacent edges intersect at exactly one point, at which they cross. Conway conjectured that if a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges can be thrackled on the plane, then $m\le n$. Conway's conjecture remains open; the best bound known is that $m\le 1.393n$. Cairns and Nikolayevsky extended this conjecture to the orientable surface $S_g$ of genus $g &gt; 0$, claiming that if a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges has a thrackle on $S_g$, then $m \le n + 2g$. We disprove this conjecture. In stark contrast with the planar case, we show that for each $g&gt;0$ there is a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $2n + 2g -8$ edges that can be thrackled on $S_g$. This leaves relatively little room for further progress involving thrackles on orientable surfaces, as every connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges that can be thrackled on $S_g$ satisfies that $m \le 2n + 4g - 2$. We prove a similar result for nonorientable surfaces. We also derive nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the minimum $g$ such that $K_{m,n}$ and $K_n$ can be thrackled on $S_g$.</description>

      <title>Restriction coefficients for partitions with at most three columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ and $\mu$ be partitions such that $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, and let $r \geq 0$. We present a combinatorial interpretation of the plethysm coefficient $\langle s_\lambda, s_\mu[s_r] \rangle$. As a consequence, we solve the restriction problem for partitions with at most three columns. That is, for all partitions $\lambda$ with $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, we find a combinatorial interpretation for the multiplicities of the irreducible $\mathfrak{S}_n$-submodules of the Schur module $\mathbb{S}^\lambda \mathbb{C}^n$, considered as an $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module.</description>

      <title>The Domination and Secure Domination Numbers of Direct Product of Cliques with Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the exact values of several domination parameters for the direct product of a complete graph with a path or a cycle. Specifically, we determine the domination number, independent domination number, $[1,2]$-domination number, secure domination number, and 2-domination number for this family of graphs. We show that, in these graphs, the independent domination number and the $[1,2]$-domination number coincide with the domination number, while the secure domination number coincides with the 2-domination number. Additionally, as a consequence of our findings, we provide counterexamples to disprove some erroneous results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Antidirected paths in oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any integer $k \ge 4$, every oriented graph with minimum semidegree bigger than $\frac{1}{2}(k-1+\sqrt{k-3})$ contains an antidirected path of length $k$. Consequently, every oriented graph on $n$ vertices with more than $(k-1+\sqrt{k-3})n$ edges contains an antidirected path of length $k$. This asymptotically proves the antidirected path version of a conjecture of Stein and of a conjecture of Addario-Berry, Havet, Linhares Sales, Reed and Thomass\'e, respectively.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a development in the computational suite for the study of $N_\infty$ operads for a finite group $G$. This progress is achieved using the simple yet powerful observation that Rubin's generation algorithm can be interpreted as a closure operator. Leveraging this perspective, we establish the existence of minimal bases for $N_\infty$ operads. By investigating these bases for certain families of groups we are led to introduce and analyze several novel combinatorial invariants for finite groups.</description>

We prove that $\mathfrak{S}(\underline{s},w)$ is connected and its cycle space is spanned by the cycles of lengths 3,4 and $n+2$, where $n$ runs over the set of all finite orders of products of two (not necessarily simple) reflections.</description>

      <title>The Unit-Zero Divisor Graph of a Commutative Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to associating a graph with a commutative ring. Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity. The unit-zero divisor graph of a commutative ring $R$, denoted by $G_{UZ}(R)$, offers a novel framework for exploring the interaction between ring and graph structures. The vertex set of $G_{UZ}(R)$ consists of all elements of the ring $R$. Two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ in $G_{UZ}(R)$ are adjacent if and only if $x + y$ is a unit and $xy$ is a zero divisor in $R$. This dual adjacency condition gives rise to a graph that reflects both the additive and multiplicative behavior of the ring. This study investigates key structural properties of $G_{UZ}(R)$, including regularity, bipartiteness, planarity, and Hamiltonicity. In addition, it examines how these graph features are influenced by the algebraic structure of the ring, particularly the group of units, the set of zero divisors, ideals, and the Jacobson radical.</description>

Abstract: A skew morphism of a finite group $G$ is an element $\varphi$ of $\mathrm{Sym}(G)$ preserving the identity element of $G$ and having the property that for each $a\in G$ there exists a non-negative integer $i_a$ such that $\varphi(ab)=\varphi(a)\varphi^{i_a}(b)$ for all $b\in G$. In this paper we show that if a skew morphism $\varphi$ of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is not an automorphism of $\mathbb{Z}_n$, then it is uniquely determined by a triple $(h,\alpha,\beta)$ where $h$ is an element of $\mathbb{Z}_n$, $\alpha$ is a skew morphism of $\mathbb{Z}_a$ where $a&lt;n$, and $\beta$ is a skew morphism of $\mathbb{Z}_b$ where either $b&lt;n$, or $b=n$ and $|\langle \beta\rangle| &lt;|\langle \varphi\rangle|$. Conversely, we also list necessary and sufficient conditions for a triple $(h,\alpha,\beta)$ to define a skew morphism of a given cyclic group. In particular, this gives a recursive characterisation of skew morphisms for all finite cyclic groups. We use this characterisation to prove new theorems about skew morphisms of cyclic groups and to generate a census of all skew morphisms for cyclic groups of order up to $2000$.</description>

      <title>Two Tiling is Undecidable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the following problem is undecidable: given two polygonal prototiles, determine whether the plane can be tiled with rotated and translated copies of them. This improves a result of Demaine and Langerman [SoCG 2025], who showed undecidability for three tiles.
  Along the way, we show that tiling with one prototile is undecidable if there can be edge-to-edge matching rules. This is the first result to show undecidability for monotiling with only local matching constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the harmonic generalizations of well-known polynomials of codes over finite fields, namely the higher weight enumerators and the extended weight enumerators, and we derive the correspondences between these weight enumerators. Moreover, we present the harmonic generalization of Greene's Theorem for the higher (resp. extended) weight enumerators. As an application of this Greene's-type theorem, we provide the MacWilliams-type identity for harmonic higher weight enumerators of codes over finite fields. Finally, we use this new identity to give a new proof of the Assmus-Mattson Theorem for subcode supports of linear codes over finite fields using harmonic higher weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>A star-comb lemma for infinite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star-comb lemma is a standard tool in infinite graph theory, which states that for every infinite set $U$ of vertices in a connected graph $G$ there exists either a subdivided infinite star in $G$ with all leaves in $U$, or an infinite comb in $G$ with all teeth in $U$.
  In this paper, we elaborate a counterpart of the star-comb lemma for directed graphs. More precisely, we prove that for every infinite set $U$ of vertices in a strongly connected directed graph $D$, there exists a strongly connected butterfly minor of $D$ with infinitely many teeth in $U$ that is either shaped by a star or shaped by a comb, or is a chain of triangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetrically self-similar graphs are an important type of fractal graph. Their Green functions satisfy order one iterative functional equations. We show when the branching number of a generating cell is two, either the graph is a star consisting of finitely many one-sided lines meeting at an origin vertex, in which case the Green function is algebraic, or the Green function is differentially transcendental over $\mathbb{C}(z)$. The proof strategy relies on a recent work of Di Vizio, Fernandes and Mishna. The result adds evidence to a conjecture of Kr\"on and Teufl about the spectrum of this family of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a duality map between the superstable configurations and the critical configurations of a graph. This was extended to all M-matrices in (Guzm\`an-Klivans 2015). We show a natural way to extend this to all $(L,M)$-chip firing pairs introduced in (Guzm\`an-Klivans 2016). In addition, we study various properties of this map.</description>

      <title>Homometric subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with cardinality 5: classification and enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are said to be homometric if they have the same multiset of pairwise cyclic (i.e., Lee) distances. Homometric subsets necessarily have the same cardinality, say $k$. In this paper, for all positive integers $n$, we classify the homometric subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with cardinality $k=5$ (modulo cyclic shifts and reflections). Our classification consists of six families of homometric pairs, and one family of homometric triples. We also give a closed-form generating function that counts these homometric pairs and triples for all $n$. As an immediate application of our result, one obtains an explicit criterion for the solvability of the crystallographic phase retrieval problem, in the setting of binary signals supported on $k=5$ many atoms. The same problem for $k \leq 4$ was partially solved by Erd\H{o}s and ultimately settled by Rosenblatt-Berman (1984), who noted that for $k \geq 5$ the problem seems very difficult. Equivalently, in the language of microtonal music theory, our result solves the open problem of classifying Z-related pentachords.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Zarankiewicz problem for bipartite subdivisions with applications to incidence geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a bipartite graph $H$, its linear threshold is the smallest real number $\sigma$ such that every bipartite graph $G = (U \sqcup V, E)$ with unbalanced parts $|V| \gtrsim |U|^\sigma$ and without a copy of $H$ must have a linear number of edges $|E| \lesssim |V|$. We prove that the linear threshold of the complete bipartite subdivision graph $K_{s,t}'$ is at most $\sigma_s = 2 - 1/s$. Moreover, we show that any $\sigma &lt; \sigma_s$ is less than the linear threshold of $K_{s,t}'$ for sufficiently large $t$ (depending on $s$ and $\sigma$).
  Some geometric applications of this result are given: we show that any $n$ points and $n$ lines in the complex plane without an $s$-by-$s$ grid determine $O(n^{4/3 - c})$ incidences for some constant $c &gt; 0$ depending on $s$; and for certain pairs $(p,q)$, we establish nontrivial lower bounds on the number of distinct distances determined by $n$ points in the plane under the condition that every $p$ points determine at least $q$ distinct distances.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $ G $ is called $ t $-tough if $ \left|S\right|\geq t\cdot w\left(G-S\right)$ for every cutset $ S $ of $G$. Chv\'atal conjectured that there exists a constant $ t_{0} $ such that every $ t_{0} $-tough graph has a hamiltonian cycle. Gao and Shan have proved that every $7$-tough $(P_{3}\cup 2P_{1})$-free grah is hamiltonian. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for $ (P_{3}\cup 3P_{1}) $-free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.05463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the moduli space of rational curves with cyclic action, constructed in our previous work, is realizable as a wonderful compactification of the complement of a hyperplane arrangement in a product of projective spaces. By proving a general result on such wonderful compactifications, we conclude that this moduli space is Chow-equivalent to an explicit toric variety (whose fan can be understood as a tropical version of the moduli space), from which a computation of its Chow ring follows.</description>

      <title>Determinantal random subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two families of determinantal random spanning subgraphs of a finite connected graph, one supported by acyclic spanning subgraphs (spanning forests) with fixed number of connected components, the other by connected spanning subgraphs with fixed number of independent cycles. Each family generalizes the uniform spanning tree and the generating functions of these probability measures generalize the classical Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials.
  We call Symanzik spanning forests the elements of the acyclic spanning subgraphs family, and single out a particular determinantal mixture of these, having as kernel a normalized Laplacian on $1$-forms, which we call the Laplacian spanning forest.
  Our proofs rely on a set of integral and real or complex (which we call geometric) multilinear identies involving cycles, coboundaries, and forests on graphs. We prove these identities using classical pieces of the algebraic topology of graphs and the exterior calculus applied to finite determinantal point processes, both of which we treat in a self-contained way.
  We emphasize the matroidal nature of our constructions, thereby showing how the above two families of random spanning subgraphs are dual to one another, as well as possible generalisations.</description>
