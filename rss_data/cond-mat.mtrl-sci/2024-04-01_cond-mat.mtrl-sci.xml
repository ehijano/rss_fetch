      <title>AlloyBERT: Alloy Property Prediction with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of novel alloys tailored to specific requirements poses significant challenges for researchers in the field. This underscores the importance of developing predictive techniques for essential physical properties of alloys based on their chemical composition and processing parameters. This study introduces AlloyBERT, a transformer encoder-based model designed to predict properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength of alloys using textual inputs. Leveraging the pre-trained RoBERTa encoder model as its foundation, AlloyBERT employs self-attention mechanisms to establish meaningful relationships between words, enabling it to interpret human-readable input and predict target alloy properties. By combining a tokenizer trained on our textual data and a RoBERTa encoder pre-trained and fine-tuned for this specific task, we achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.00015 on the Multi Principal Elemental Alloys (MPEA) data set and 0.00611 on the Refractory Alloy Yield Strength (RAYS) dataset. This surpasses the performance of shallow models, which achieved a best-case MSE of 0.00025 and 0.0076 on the MPEA and RAYS datasets respectively. Our results highlight the potential of language models in material science and establish a foundational framework for text-based prediction of alloy properties that does not rely on complex underlying representations, calculations, or simulations.</description>

      <title>Half century of Efros-Shklovskii Coulomb gap. Romance with Coulomb interaction and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efros-Shklovskii (ES) Coulomb gap in density of localized states and ES law of the variable range hopping conductivity were coined 50 years ago. The theory and its first confirmations were reviewed in our monograph 40-years ago. This paper reviews the subsequent experimental evidence, theoretical advancements, and novel applications. Out of hundreds of experimental validations of the ES law in a diverse range of materials, I focus on those where the dynamic range of conductivity exceeds four orders of magnitude. These include three- and two-dimensional semiconductors under both zero and high magnetic fields, localized phases in the quantum Hall effect, granular metals, nanocrystal arrays, and conducting polymers. Additionally, this review discusses the Coulomb gap near insulator-metal transition and in non-ohmic ES law. Recent developments of other concepts of the ES book are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Formation of Oriented Bilayer Motif -- Vanadyl Phthalocyanine on Ag(100)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption and self-assembly of vanadyl phthalocyanine molecules on Ag(100) has been investigated using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory. At sub-monolayer coverage, we observe two distinct adsorption configurations of isolated molecules, corresponding to the central O atom pointing toward (O-down) or away (O-up) from the substrate. Upon adsorption in the O-up orientation, the otherwise achiral molecules take on a windmill-like chiral appearance due to their interaction with the substrate. At monolayer coverage, we observe a self-assembled square lattice with a mixture of O-up and O-down molecules. At higher coverage we find a strong preference for bilayer formation with O-up and O-down molecules in alternating layers, suggesting stabilization by dipolar interactions. Close inspection of the multi-layer surface reveals grain boundaries separating domains of opposite organizational chirality, and long-range ordering.</description>

      <title>Static versus dynamically polarizable environments within the many-body $\bf{GW}$ formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum or discrete polarizable models for the study of optoelectronic processes in embedded subsystems rely mostly on the restriction of the surrounding electronic dielectric response to its low frequency limit. Such a description hinges on the assumption that the electrons in the surrounding medium react instantaneously to any excitation in the central subsystem, treating thus the environment in the adiabatic limit. Exploiting a recently developed embedded $GW$ formalism, with an environment described at the fully ab initio level, we assess the merits of the adiabatic limit with respect to an environment where the full dynamics of the dielectric response is considered. Further, we show how to properly take the static limit of the environment susceptibility, introducing the so-called Coulomb-hole and screened-exchange contributions to the reaction field. As a first application, we consider a C$_{60}$ molecule at the surface of a C$_{60}$ crystal, namely a case where the dynamics of the embedded and embedding subsystems are similar. The common adiabatic assumption, when properly treated, generates errors below $10\%$ on the polarization energy associated with frontier energy levels and associated energy gaps. Finally, we consider a water molecule inside a metallic nanotube, the worst case for the environment adiabatic limit. The error on the gap polarization energy remains below $10\%$, even though the error on the frontier orbitals polarization energies can reach a few tenths of an electronvolt.</description>

      <title>Na Vacancy Driven Phase Transformation and Fast Ion Conduction in W-doped Na$_3$SbS$_4$ from Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state sodium batteries require effective electrolytes that conduct at room temperature. The Na$_3$SbS$_4$ (Pn = P, Sb; Ch = S, Se) family have been studied for their high Na ion conductivity. The population of Na vacancies, which mediate ion diffusion in these materials, can be enhanced through aliovalent doping on the pnictogen site. To probe the microscopic role of extrinsic doping, and its impact on diffusion and phase stability, we trained a machine learning force field for Na$_{3-x}$W$_{x}$Sb$_{1-x}$S$_4$ based on an equivariant graph neural network. Analysis of large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories shows that an increased Na vacancy population stabilises the global cubic phase at lower temperatures with enhanced Na ion diffusion, and that the explicit role of the substitutional W dopants is limited. In the global cubic phase we observe large and long-lived deviations of atoms from the averaged symmetry, echoing recent experimental suggestions. Evidence of correlated Na ion diffusion is also presented that underpins the suggested superionic nature of these materials.</description>

      <title>Refining microstructures in additively manufactured Al/Cu gradients through TiB$_2$ inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The additive manufacture of compositionally graded Al/Cu parts by laser engineered net shaping (LENS) is demonstrated. The use of a blue light build laser enabled deposition on a Cu substrate. The thermal gradient and rapid solidification inherent to selective laser melting enabled mass transport of Cu up to 4 mm away from a Cu substrate through a pure Al deposition, providing a means of producing gradients with finer step sizes than the printed layer thicknesses. Printing graded structures with pure Al, however, was prevented by the growth of Al$_2$Cu$_3$ dendrites and acicular grains amid a matrix of Al$_2$Cu. A combination of adding TiB$_2$ grain refining powder and actively varying print layer composition suppressed the dendritic growth mode and produced an equiaxed microstructure in a compositionally graded part. Material phase was characterized for crystal structure and nanoindentation hardness to enable a discussion of phase evolution in the rapidly solidifying melt pool of a LENS print.</description>

      <title>A generalized approach for rapid entropy calculation of liquids and solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a comprehensive methodology for the fast computation of entropy across both solid and liquid phases. The proposed method utilizes a single trajectory of molecular dynamics (MD) to facilitate the calculation of entropy, which is composed of three components. The electronic entropy is determined through the temporal average acquired from density functional theory (DFT) MD simulations. The vibrational entropy, typically the predominant contributor to the total entropy, even within the liquid state, is evaluated by computing the phonon density of states via the velocity auto-correlation function. The most arduous component to quantify, the configurational entropy, is assessed by probability analysis of the local structural arrangement and atomic distribution. We illustrate, through a variety of examples, that this method is both a versatile and valid technique for characterizing the thermodynamic states of both solids and liquids. Furthermore, this method is employed to expedite the calculation of melting temperatures, demonstrating its practical utility in computational thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from On-Chip Metallization on 2D Topological Chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ bulk samples with high critical current density using a spark plasma sintering technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high density CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ bulk sample was successfully synthesized using a spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The density of the synthesized sample was 5.02 g cm$^{-3}$, corresponding to 96.2% of the theoretical density of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$. Moreover, a reasonably high Vickers hardness of 1 GPa was measured. The electrical resistivity of the SPS bulk sample was as low as approximately 600 $\mu\Omega$ cm at 300 K, which is smaller than that of the ordinary sintered polycrystalline sample by nearly one order of magnitude, and exhibited a sharp superconducting transition, with the transition width $\Delta\textit{T}_c$ less than 2 K, indicating an improved grain connectivity. The critical current density of the SPS bulk sample, as calculated from the magnetization hysteresis loops (magnetic $\textit{J}_c$), reached 18 kA cm$^{-2}$ at 4.2 K under 5 T, which is the highest among the iron-based superconductor polycrystalline samples reported thus far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grain alignment is a key factor that determines the performance of a superconducting bulk. In this study, the spark plasma texturing (SPT) technique was used to fabricate a CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ superconducting bulk. X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction revealed that the $c$-axes of the CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ grains in the SPT bulk are aligned, demonstrating that the SPT technique is effective in achieving $c$-axis texture. In addition, chemical composition analysis showed that oxide impurities, which affect the grain boundary characteristics that determine the inter-grain critical current density ($J_c$), are randomly distributed in the SPT bulk. Magnetization measurements showed high $J_c$ values of the SPT bulk, reaching 127 kA cm$^{-2}$ and 26 kA cm$^{-2}$ at 4.2 K under a self-field and magnetic field of 5 T, respectively. These results suggest that the SPT technique is a promising approach for obtaining a high-performance superconducting bulk material for high-field applications.</description>

      <title>Piezomagnetism in the Ising ferromagnet URhGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezomagnetism, linear response between strain and magnetic field, is relatively unexplored cross-correlation but has promising potential as a novel probe of time-reversal-symmetry breaking in various classes of materials. Interestingly, there has been no report of piezomagnetism in ferromagnets, most archetypal time-reversal-symmetry-broken materials. This half-century absence of piezomagnetic ferromagnets is attributable to complications originating from multiple-domain states, as well as from changes in the magnetic point group by rotation of magnetic moment. Here, we report characteristic V-shaped magnetostriction in the Ising itinerant ferromagnet URhGe, observed by simultaneous multi-axis strain measurement technique utilizing optical fiber Bragg grating sensors. This novel magnetostriction occurs only under fields along the c axis and does not scale with the square of magnetization. Such unconventional feature indicates piezomagnetism as its origin. Our observation, marking the first report of piezomagnetism in ferromagnets, is owing to the mono-domain switching and the Ising magnetization. The obtained piezomagnetic coefficients are fairly large, implying that Ising ferromagnets are promising frontiers when seeking for materials with large piezomagnetic responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of quantum vortices determines the electromagnetic response of superconducting materials and devices. Controlling the vortex motion, their pinning on intrinsic and artificial defects is therefore essential for superconducting electronics. Here we take advantage of the attractive force between a magnetic cantilever of the Magnetic Force Microscope and a single quantum vortex to spatially map the pinning force inside 50-240 nm thick magnetron-sputtered Nb-films, commonly used in advanced superconducting electronics. The revealed pinning nano-network is related to the thickness-dependent granular structure of the films as well as to the characteristic microscopic scales of superconductivity. Our approach is general, and can be directly applied to other type II granular superconducting materials and nanodevices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated crystallization and self-assembly phenomena in polyacrylamide (PAM) solutions during evaporation. As the solvent gradually evaporated, microscopic crystals began to form in the solution. The results show that concentration gradients form as the solution evaporates, leading to varied crystalline morphologies. From the edge to the center of the PAM solution, grass-like structures with intricate vein-like patterns and irregular morphologies were formed. The concentration gradient played a crucial role in this process. The relationship between the concentration gradient and crystalline structures was elucidated using absorbance spectroscopy. Schematics and absorbance spectra illustrate the evolution of the crystallization stages. Our findings not only contribute to a fundamental understanding of colloidal self-assembly but also hold significant implications for various applications, including thin-film fabrication, drug delivery, and nanotechnology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a field-free switching mechanism that utilizes two spatially orthogonal spin-orbit torque (SOT) currents. Initially applied simultaneously, one of the currents is subsequently switched off. The superposition of these two currents results in an in-plane magnetization, which is not orthogonal to the remaining SOT current after the second one is deactivated. This symmetry-breaking procedure leads to reproducible and rapid switching, with field pulse durations as short as 0.25 nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable quantum acoustoelectric transport in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport probes the motion of quasiparticles in response to external excitations. Apart from the well-known electric and thermoelectric transport, acoustoelectric transport induced by traveling acoustic waves has been rarely explored. Here, by adopting a hybrid nanodevices integrated with piezoelectric substrates, we establish a simple design of acoustoelectric transport with gate tunability. We fabricate dual-gated acoustoelectric devices based on BN-encapsuled graphene on LiNbO3. Longitudinal and transverse acoustoelectric voltages are generated by launching pulsed surface acoustic wave. The gate dependence of zero-field longitudinal acoustoelectric signal presents strikingly similar profiles as that of Hall resistivity, providing a valid approach for extracting carrier density without magnetic field. In magnetic fields, acoustoelectric quantum oscillations appear due to Landau quantization, which are more robust and pronounced than Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Our work demonstrates a feasible acoustoelectric setup with gate tunability, which can be extended to the broad scope of various Van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>A microstructure-sensitive electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field model of pitting and stress corrosion cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field formulation is developed to simulate pitting and stress corrosion in polycrystalline materials. The formulation incorporates dependencies of mechanical properties and corrosion potential on crystallographic orientation. The model considers the formation and charging dynamics of an electric double layer through a new general boundary condition for the solution potential. The potential of the model is demonstrated by simulating corrosion in polycrystalline materials with various grain morphology distributions. The results show that incorporating the underlying microstructure yields more extensive defects, faster defect kinetics, and irregular pit and crack shapes relative to a microstructurally-insensitive homogeneous material scenario.</description>

      <title>Phonon pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent studies, it has been discovered that phonons can carry angular momentum, leading to a series of investigations into systems with 3-fold rotation symmetry. However, for systems with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry, such as $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, there has been no relevant discussion. In this paper, we investigated the pseudoangular momentum of phonons in crystals with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry. Taking $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ as an example, we explain the selection rules in circularly polarized Raman experiments resulting from pseudoangular momentum conservation, providing important guidance for experiments. This study of pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ opens up a new degree of freedom for its potential applications, expanding into new application domains.</description>

      <title>Detection of spin pumping free of rectification and thermal artefacts in molecular-based ferromagnetic insulator V[TCNE]x~2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The molecular-based ferrimagnetic insulator V(TCNE)x has gained recent interest for efficient spin-wave excitation due to its low Gilbert damping ratio a=4E-5, and narrow ferromagnetic resonance linewidth f=1Oe. Here we report a clean spin pumping signal detected on V(TCNE)x/metal bilayer structures, free from spin rectification or thermal artifacts. On-chip coupling of microwave power is achieved via a coplanar waveguide to measure the in-plane angle-dependence of the inverse spin-Hall effect under ferromagnetic resonance conditions with respect to a constant external magnetic field. A signature of pure spin current from V(TCNE)x is observed in both platinum and permalloy metal layers, demonstrating the utility of V(TCNE)x for magnon spintronics studies in molecule/solid-state heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Impact of a $MoS_2$ monolayer on the nanoscale thermoelastic response of silicon heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the thermoelastic response of a nanostructure is crucial for the choice of materials and interfaces in electronic devices with improved and tailored transport properties, at the length scales of the present technology. Here we show how the deposition of a $MoS_2$ monolayer can strongly modify the nanoscale thermoelastic dynamics of silicon substrates close to their interface. We achieve this result by creating a transient grating with extreme ultraviolet light, using ultrashort free-electron laser pulses, whose $\approx$84 nm period is comparable to the size of elements typically used in nanodevices, such as electric contacts and nanowires. The thermoelastic response, featured by coherent acoustic waves and an incoherent relaxation, is tangibly modified by the presence of monolayer $MoS_2$. Namely, we observed a major reduction of the amplitude of the surface mode, which is almost suppressed, while the longitudinal mode is basically unperturbed, aside from a faster decay of the acoustic modulations. We interpret this behavior as a selective modification of the surface elasticity and we discuss the conditions to observe such effect, which might be of immediate relevance for the design of Si-based nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Fragility of surface states in non-Wigner Dyson topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators and superconductors support extended surface states protected against the otherwise localizing effects of static disorder. Specifically, in the Wigner-Dyson insulators belonging to the symmetry classes A, AI, and AII, a band of extended surface states is continuously connected to a likewise extended set of bulk states forming a ``bridge'' between different surfaces via the mechanism of spectral flow. In this work we show that this mechanism is absent in the majority of non-Wigner-Dyson topological superconductors and chiral topological insulators. In these systems, there is precisely one point with granted extended states, the center of the band, $E=0$. Away from it, states are spatially localized, or can be made so by the addition of spatially local potentials. Considering the three-dimensional insulator in class AIII and winding number $\nu=1$ as a paradigmatic case study, we discuss the physical principles behind this phenomenon, and its methodological and applied consequences. In particular, we show that low-energy Dirac approximations in the description of surface states can be treacherous in that they tend to conceal the localizability phenomenon. We also identify markers defined in terms of Berry curvature as measures for the degree of state localization in lattice models, and back our analytical predictions by extensive numerical simulations. A main conclusion of this work is that the surface phenomenology of non-Wigner-Dyson topological insulators is a lot richer than that of their Wigner-Dyson siblings, extreme limits being spectrum-wide quantum critical delocalization of all states vs. full localization except at the $E=0$ critical point. As part of our study we identify possible experimental signatures distinguishing between these different alternatives in transport or tunnel spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale variation of the Rashba energy in BiTeI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BiTeI is a polar semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that produces large Rashba spin splitting. Due to its potential utility in spintronics and magnetoelectrics, it is essential to understand how defects impact the spin transport in this material. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we image ring-like charging states of single-atom defects on the iodine surface of BiTeI. We observe nanoscale variations in the Rashba energy around each defect, which we correlate with the local electric field extracted from the bias dependence of each ring radius. Our data demonstrate the local impact of atomic defects on the Rashba effect, which is both a challenge and an opportunity for the development of future nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Controllable bipolaron formation unveiling structural features of trap states in organic charge transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance methods offer a unique chance for in-depth study of conductive organic material systems, not only accounts for number of charge carriers, but also allows manipulations of spin dynamics of particles. Here we present a study of continuous-wave electrically detected magnetic resonance on a range of organic conjugate polymers under transistor architecture, with tunability in both carrier concentration and drifting electric field. We demonstrate the general existence of bipolaron between mobile and trapped charges at the magnetic resonance condition, then estimates the wavefunction expansion of charge carriers on their hopping sites along conductive pathways. This finding allows direct observation of energetically disordered trap sites under the charge hopping picture, linking-up the microscopic structural properties to the bulk electronic performances.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of effective light transport properties in fully anisotropic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structurally anisotropic materials are ubiquitous in several application fields, yet their accurate optical characterization remains challenging due to the lack of general models linking their scattering coefficients to the macroscopic transport observables, and the need to combine multiple measurements to retrieve their direction-dependent values. Here, we present an improved method for the experimental determination of light transport tensor coefficients from the diffusive rates measured along all three directions, based on transient transmittance measurements and a generalized Monte Carlo model. We apply our method to the characterization of light transport properties in two common anisotropic materials - polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape and paper - highlighting the magnitude of systematic deviations that are typically incurred when neglecting anisotropy.</description>
