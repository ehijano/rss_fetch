      <title>An Efficient Phase-field Framework for Contact Dynamics between Deformable Solids in Fluid Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic contact in hydrodynamic environments is a complex multiphysics phenomenon and can be found in applications ranging from engineering to biological systems. Understanding the intricacies of this problem requires the development of a generalized framework capable of handling topological changes and transitioning implicitly from fluid-structure interaction (FSI) conditions to solid-solid contact conditions. We propose a mono-field interface advancing method for handling multibody contact simulations in a submerged environment. Given the physical demands of the problem, we adopt a phase-field based fully Eulerian approach to resolve the multiphase and multibody interactions in the system. We employ a stabilized finite element formulation and a partitioned iterative procedure to solve the unified momentum equation comprising solid and fluid dynamics coupled with the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation. We introduce a contact force approach to handle smooth elastic-elastic and elastic-rigid contact based on the overlap of the diffused interfaces of two colliding bodies. The diffuse interface representation ameliorates the issue of discontinuous contact forces generally found in conventional approaches. The implemented model is verified for smooth dry contact and FSI contact scenarios. We obtain a spatial convergence rate of around $1.8$ for the Hertzian contact case involving a deformable cylinder on an elastic plane. Relative volume error is found to be within $5\%$ for the FSI contact case. The developed approach eliminates the need for solving multiple phase-field equations or reconstructing the solid boundaries at every time step. This reduces the overall computational time by nearly $10\%$ compared to an explicit interface extraction method. Using the proposed framework, we demonstrate the collision dynamics between multiple bodies submerged in an open tank.</description>

      <title>Modeling sea ice in the marginal ice zone as a dense granular flow with rheology inferred from a discrete element model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The marginal ice zone (MIZ) represents the periphery of the sea ice cover. Here, the macroscale behavior of the sea ice results from collisions and enduring contact between ice floes. This configuration closely resembles that of dense granular flows, which have been modeled successfully with the $\mu(I)$ rheology. Here, we present a continuous model based on the $\mu(I)$ rheology which treats sea ice as a compressible fluid, with the local sea ice concentration given by a dilatancy function $\Phi(I)$. We infer expressions for $\mu(I)$ and $\Phi(I)$ from a discrete element method (DEM) which considers polygonal-shaped ice floes. We do this by driving the sea ice with a one-dimensional shearing ocean current. The resulting continuous model is a nonlinear system of equations with the sea ice velocity, local concentration, and pressure as unknowns. The rheology is given by the sum of a plastic and a viscous term. In the context of a periodic patch of ocean, which is effectively a one dimensional problem, and under steady conditions, we prove this system to be well-posed, present a numerical algorithm for solving it, and compare its solutions to those of the DEM. These comparisons demonstrate the continuous model's ability to capture most of the DEM's results accurately. The continuous model is particularly accurate for ocean currents faster than 0.25 m/s; however, for low concentrations and slow ocean currents, the continuous model is less effective in capturing the DEM results. In the latter case, the lack of accuracy of the continuous model is found to be accompanied by the breakdown of a balance between the average shear stress and the integrated ocean drag extracted from the DEM.</description>

      <title>Collisions of Burgers Bores with Nonlinear Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper treats nonlinear wave current interactions in their simplest form, as an overtaking collision. In one spatial dimension, the paper investigates the collision interaction formulated as an initial value problem of a Burgers bore overtaking solutions of two types of nonlinear wave equations, Korteweg de Vries (KdV) and nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS). The bore wave state arising after the overtaking Burgers-KdV collision in numerical simulations is found to depend qualitatively on the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion in the KdV equation. The Burgers-KdV system is also made stochastic by following the stochastic advection by Lie transport approach (SALT).</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach For Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification Of Turbulent Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of complex turbulent flow are part and parcel of the engineering design process. Eddy viscosity based turbulence models represent the workhorse for these simulations. The underlying simplifications in eddy viscosity models make them computationally inexpensive but also introduce structural uncertainties in their predictions. Currently the Eigenspace Perturbation Method is the only approach to predict these uncertainties. Due to its purely physics based nature this method often leads to unrealistically large uncertainty bounds that lead to exceedingly conservative designs. We use a Deep Learning based approach to address this issue. We control the perturbations using trained deep learning models that predict how much to perturb the modeled Reynolds stresses. This is executed using a Convolutional Neural Network that learns the difference between eddy viscosity based model predictions and high fidelity data as a mapping of flow features. We show that this approach leads to improvements over the Eigenspace Perturbation Method.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Flux Limiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stable numerical integration of shocks in compressible flow simulations relies on the reduction or elimination of Gibbs phenomena (unstable, spurious oscillations). A popular method to virtually eliminate Gibbs oscillations caused by numerical discretization in under-resolved simulations is to use a flux limiter. A wide range of flux limiters has been studied in the literature, with recent interest in their optimization via machine learning methods trained on high-resolution datasets. The common use of flux limiters in numerical codes as plug-and-play blackbox components makes them key targets for design improvement. Moreover, while aleatoric (inherent randomness) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainty is commonplace in fluid dynamical systems, these effects are generally ignored in the design of flux limiters. Even for deterministic dynamical models, numerical uncertainty is introduced via coarse-graining required by insufficient computational power to solve all scales of motion. Here, we introduce a conceptually distinct type of flux limiter that is designed to handle the effects of randomness in the model and uncertainty in model parameters. This new, {\it probabilistic flux limiter}, learned with high-resolution data, consists of a set of flux limiting functions with associated probabilities, which define the frequencies of selection for their use. Using the example of Burgers' equation, we show that a machine learned, probabilistic flux limiter may be used in a shock capturing code to more accurately capture shock profiles. In particular, we show that our probabilistic flux limiter outperforms standard limiters, and can be successively improved upon (up to a point) by expanding the set of probabilistically chosen flux limiting functions.</description>

      <title>QLingNet: An efficient and flexible modeling framework for subsonic airfoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques are considered an effective means to accelerate flow field simulations. However, current deep learning methods struggle to achieve generalization to flow field resolutions while ensuring computational efficiency. This paper presents a deep learning approach for rapid prediction of two types of subsonic flow fields with different resolutions. Unlike convolutional neural networks, the constructed feature extractor integrates features of different spatial scales along the channel dimension, reducing the sensitivity of the deep learning model to resolution while improving computational efficiency. Additionally, to ensure consistency between the input and output resolutions of the deep learning model, a memory pooling strategy is proposed, which ensures accurate reconstruction of flow fields at any resolution. By conducting extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses on a given test dataset, it is demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model can achieve a three-order-of-magnitude speedup compared to CPU-based solvers while adapting to flow fields of arbitrary resolutions. Moreover, the prediction accuracy for pressure exceeds 99\%, laying the foundation for the development of large-scale models in the field of aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>An experimental and theoretical investigation of spray characteristics of impinging jets in impact wave regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study focuses on experimentally and theoretically improving the characterization of the drop size and drop velocity for like-on-like doublet impinging jets. The experimental measurements were made using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) at jet Weber numbers We j corresponding to the impact wave regime of impinging jet atomization. A more suitable dynamic range was used for PDA measurements compared to the literature, resulting in more accurate experimental measurements for drop diameters and velocities. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding the ability of linear stability analysis to accurately predict drop diameters in the impact wave regime. This work seeks to provide some clarity. It was discovered that the assumed uniform jet velocity profile was a contributing factor for deviation between diameter predictions based on models in the literature and experimental measurements. Analytical expressions that depend on parameters based on the assumed jet velocity profile are presented in this work. Predictions based on the parabolic and 1/7th power law turbulent profiles were considered and show better agreement with the experimental measurements compared to predictions based on the previous models. Experimental mean drop velocity measurements were compared with predictions from a force balance analysis, and it was observed that the assumed jet velocity profile also influences the predicted velocities, with the turbulent profile agreeing best with the experimental mean velocity. It is concluded that the assumed jet velocity profile has a predominant effect on drop diameter and velocity predictions.</description>

      <title>Liquid Sheet Breakup in Gas-Centered Swirl Coaxial Atomizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study deals with the breakup behavior of swirling liquid sheets discharging from gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers with attention focused toward the understanding of the role of central gas jet on the liquid sheet breakup. Cold flow experiments on the liquid sheet breakup were carried out by employing custom fabricated gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers using water and air as experimental fluids. Photographic techniques were employed to capture the flow behavior of liquid sheets at different flow conditions. Quantitative variation on the breakup length of the liquid sheet and spray width were obtained from the measurements deduced from the images of liquid sheets. The sheet breakup process is significantly influenced by the central air jet. It is observed that low inertia liquid sheets are more vulnerable to the presence of the central air jet and develop shorter breakup lengths at smaller values of the air jet Reynolds number $Re_g$. High inertia liquid sheets ignore the presence of the central air jet at smaller values of $Re_g$ and eventually develop shorter breakup lengths at higher values of $Re_g$. The experimental evidences suggest that the central air jet causes corrugations on the liquid sheet surface, which may be promoting the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the liquid sheet increases with increasing $Re_g$. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations reveals that the entrainment process of air established between the inner surface of the liquid sheet and the central air jet is the primary trigger for the sheet breakup.</description>

      <title>Unit-Constrained Data-Driven Turbulence Modeling for Separated Flows Using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method is an essential tool for turbulence research in engineering. The RANS method relies on turbulence models to close the governing equations, with Linear Eddy Viscosity Models (LEVMs) based on the Boussinesq hypothesis being prevalently utilized across engineering applications. However, the intrinsic limitations of the Boussinesq assumption render LEVMs less accurate for large separated turbulent flows, prompting the development of numerous modified LEVM variants. Recently, machine learning approaches, notably neural networks, have been employed to enhance LEVMs. Nonetheless, the "black box" nature of such machine learning techniques poses significant interpretability challenges in refining turbulence models. This paper introduces a novel unit-constrained turbulence modeling framework using symbolic regression to overcome these hurdles. This framework amends the constitutive equation of original LEVMs by establishing explicit equations between the Reynolds stress deviation and mean flow quantities, with unit consistency constraints bolstering the efficiency of the symbolic regression learning process. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to the separated flow over 2D periodic hills. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the learned turbulence model. Compared to the standard k-{\epsilon} model, the learned model exhibits significantly enhanced predictive accuracy for anisotropic Reynolds stresses and flow velocities, more precisely delineates flow separation, and shows promising generalization potential.</description>

      <title>Predicting Ship Responses in Different Seaways using a Generalizable Force Correcting Machine Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learning (ML) method is generalizable if it can make predictions on inputs which differ from the training dataset. For predictions of wave-induced ship responses, generalizability is an important consideration if ML methods are to be useful in design evaluations. Furthermore, the size of the training dataset has a significant impact on the practicality of a method, especially when training data is generated using high-fidelity numerical tools which are expensive. This paper considers a hybrid machine learning method which corrects the force in a low-fidelity equation of motion. The method is applied to two different case studies: the nonlinear responses of a Duffing equation subject to irregular excitation, and high-fidelity heave and pitch response data of a Fast Displacement Ship (FDS) in head seas. The generalizability of the method is determined in both cases by making predictions of the response in irregular wave conditions that differ from those in the training dataset. The influence that low-fidelity physics-based terms in the hybrid model have on generalizability is also investigated. The predictions are compared to two benchmarks: a linear physics-based model and a data-driven LSTM model. It is found that the hybrid method offers an improvement in prediction accuracy and generalizability when trained on a small dataset.</description>

      <title>Undisturbed velocity recovery with transient and weak inertia effects in volume-filtered simulations of particle-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In volume-filtered Euler-Lagrange simulations of particle-laden flows, the fluid forces acting on a particle are estimated using reduced models, which rely on the knowledge of the local undisturbed flow for that particle. Since the two-way coupling between the particle and the fluid creates a local flow perturbation, the filtered fluid velocity interpolated to the particle location must be corrected prior to estimating the fluid forces, so as to subtract the contribution of this perturbation and recover the local undisturbed flow with good accuracy. In this manuscript, we present a new model for estimating a particle's self-induced flow disturbance that accounts for its transient development and for inertial effects related to finite particle Reynolds numbers. The model also does not require the direction of the momentum feedback to align with the direction of the particle's relative velocity, allowing force contributions other than the steady drag force to be considered. It is based upon the linearization of the volume-filtered equations governing the particle's self-induced flow disturbance, such that their solution can be expressed as a linear combination of regularized transient Stokeslet contributions. Tested on a range of numerical cases, the model is shown to consistently estimate the particle's self-induced flow disturbance with high accuracy both in steady and highly transient flow environments, as well as for finite particle Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Increased solidification delays fragmentation and suppresses rebound of impacting drops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The splat formed after drop impact on supercooled solid surfaces sticks to it. On the contrary, a sublimating supercooled surface such as dry ice inhibits pinning and therefore efficiently rebounds drops made of a variety of liquids. While rebound is expected at lower impact velocities on dry ice, at higher impact velocities the drop fragments leaving behind a trail of smaller droplets. However, it is not known whether rebound can be entirely suppressed or fragmentation be controlled on such surfaces and if it depends on the extent of solidification inside the drop. In this work, we report on the role played by solidification within drops in modifying the outcomes of their impact on the supercooled ultra-low adhesive surface of sublimating dry ice. We show that the solidification thickness depends on the impact velocity and is the primary driver in suppression of rebound and also promotes a delay in fragmentation. Our findings imply that sublimating supercooled surfaces can present a broad spectrum of outcomes from complete bouncing to no-rebound which are not seen in drop impacts on supercooled superhydrophobic surfaces. We attribute this to thermo-elastocapillarity which considers bending of the solidified layer and is used to demarcate regime boundaries and determine the coefficient of restitution during rebound.</description>

      <title>Filtered Partial Differential Equations: a robust surrogate constraint in physics-informed deep learning framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding physical knowledge into neural network (NN) training has been a hot topic. However, when facing the complex real-world, most of the existing methods still strongly rely on the quantity and quality of observation data. Furthermore, the neural networks often struggle to converge when the solution to the real equation is very complex. Inspired by large eddy simulation in computational fluid dynamics, we propose an improved method based on filtering. We analyzed the causes of the difficulties in physics informed machine learning, and proposed a surrogate constraint (filtered PDE, FPDE in short) of the original physical equations to reduce the influence of noisy and sparse observation data. In the noise and sparsity experiment, the proposed FPDE models (which are optimized by FPDE constraints) have better robustness than the conventional PDE models. Experiments demonstrate that the FPDE model can obtain the same quality solution with 100% higher noise and 12% quantity of observation data of the baseline. Besides, two groups of real measurement data are used to show the FPDE improvements in real cases. The final results show that FPDE still gives more physically reasonable solutions when facing the incomplete equation problem and the extremely sparse and high-noise conditions. For combining real-world experiment data into physics-informed training, the proposed FPDE constraint is useful and performs well in two real-world experiments: modeling the blood velocity in vessels and cell migration in scratches.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and fluid-structure interaction in turbulent flows within and above flexible canopies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible canopy flows are often encountered in natural scenarios, e.g., when crops sway in the wind or when submerged kelp forests are agitated by marine currents. Here, we provide a detailed characterisation of the turbulent flow developed above and between the flexible filaments of a fully submerged dense canopy and we describe their dynamical response to the turbulent forcing. We investigate a wide range of flexibilities, encompassing the case in which the filaments are completely rigid and standing upright as well as that where they are fully compliant to the flow and deflected in the streamwise direction. We are thus able to isolate the effect of the canopy flexibility on the drag and on the inner-outer flow interactions, as well as the two flapping regimes of the filaments already identified for a single fiber. Furthermore, we offer a detailed description of the Reynolds stresses throughout the wall-normal direction resorting to the Lumley triangle formalism, and we show the multi-layer nature of turbulence inside and above the canopy. The relevance of our investigation is thus twofold: the fundamental physical understanding developed here paves the way towards the investigation of more complex and realistic scenarios, while we also provide a thorough characterisation of the turbulent state that can prove useful in the development of accurate turbulence models for RANS and LES.</description>

Abstract: The flow convergence method includes calculation of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) and is widely used to classify mitral regurgitation (MR) with echocardiography. It constitutes a primary decision factor for determination of treatment and should therefore be a robust quantification method. However, it is known for its tendency to underestimate MR and its dependence on user expertise. The present work systematically compares different pulsatile flow profiles arising from different regurgitation orifices using transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) probe and particle image velocimetry (PIV) as a reference in an in-vitro environment. It is found that the inter-observer variability using echocardiography is small compared to the systematic underestimation of the regurgitation volume for large orifice areas (up to 52%) where a violation of the flow convergence method assumptions occurs. From a flow perspective, a starting vortex was found as a dominant flow pattern in the regurgant jet for all orifice shapes and sizes. A series of simplified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations indicate that selecting a suboptimal aliasing velocity during echocardiography measurements might be a primary source of potential underestimation in MR characterization via the PISA-based method, reaching up to 40%. In this study, it has been noted in clinical observations that physicians often select an aliasing velocity higher than necessary for optimal estimation in diagnostic procedures.</description>

      <title>A Meshless Solver for Blood Flow Simulations in Elastic Vessels Using Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Investigating blood flow in the cardiovascular system is crucial for assessing cardiovascular health. Computational approaches offer some non-invasive alternatives to measure blood flow dynamics. Numerical simulations based on traditional methods such as finite-element and other numerical discretizations have been extensively studied and have yielded excellent results. However, adapting these methods to real-life simulations remains a complex task. In this paper, we propose a method that offers flexibility and can efficiently handle real-life simulations. We suggest utilizing the physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in a deformable domain, specifically addressing the simulation of blood flow in elastic vessels. Our approach models blood flow using an incompressible, viscous Navier-Stokes equation in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian form. The mechanical model for the vessel wall structure is formulated by an equation of Newton's second law of momentum and linear elasticity to the force exerted by the fluid flow. Our method is a mesh-free approach that eliminates the need for discretization and meshing of the computational domain. This makes it highly efficient in solving simulations involving complex geometries. Additionally, with the availability of well-developed open-source machine learning framework packages and parallel modules, our method can easily be accelerated through GPU computing and parallel computing. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on regular cylinder vessels as well as vessels with plaque on their walls. We compared our results to a solution calculated by Finite Element Methods using a dense grid and small time steps, which we considered as the ground truth solution. We report the relative error and the time consumed to solve the problem, highlighting the advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>
