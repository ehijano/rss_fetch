      <title>Stability theory over toroidal or Novikov type base and Canonical modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up a generalization of ubiquitous one parameter families in algebraic geometry and its use for stability theories ([Mum65, HL14, AHLH23]) to families over toric varieties, Novikov type rings, or its complex analytic analogues. The language allows us to reformulate degenerations of "irrational" direction in various literatures as canonical objects in a unified manner.
  Compatibly, we generalize the stable reduction type theorem for $\Theta$-stratification in [AHLH23] of Langton type to our higher rank setup.</description>

      <title>Cohomological splitting over rationally connected bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a cohomological splitting result for Hamiltonian fibrations over enumeratively rationally connected symplectic manifolds. As a key application, we prove that the cohomology of a smooth, projective family over a smooth stably rational projective variety splits additively over any field. The main ingredient in our arguments is the theory of Fukaya-Parker-Ono (FOP) perturbations developed by the first and third author, which allows one to define integer-valued Gromov-Witten type invariants.</description>

      <title>On the Kodaira types of elliptic curves with potentially good supersingular reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be a Henselian discrete valuation domain with field of fractions $K$. Assume that $\mathcal{O}_K$ has algebraically closed residue field $k$. Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve with additive reduction. The semi-stable reduction theorem asserts that there exists a minimal extension $L/K$ such that the base change $E_L/L$ has semi-stable reduction.
  It is natural to wonder whether specific properties of the semi-stable reduction and of the extension $L/K$ impose restrictions on what types of Kodaira type the special fiber of $E/K$ may have. In this paper we study the restrictions imposed on the reduction type when the extension $L/K$ is wildly ramified of degree $2$, and the curve $E/K$ has potentially good supersingular reduction. We also analyze the possible reduction types of two isogenous elliptic curves with these properties.</description>

      <title>SYZ and optimal transport stability of Weyl polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal transport stability (in the sense of Andreasson and the second author) for reflexive Weyl polytopes: reflexive polytopes which are convex hulls of an orbit of a Weyl group. When the reflexive Weyl polytope is Delzant, it follows from work of Li, Andreasson, Hultgren, Jonsson, Mazzon, that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for the Dwork family in the corresponding toric Fano manifold. In particular, we show that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for centrally symmetric smooth Fano toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Brian\c{c}on-Skoda Theorem via weak functoriality of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a sufficiently functorial assignment from rings to big Cohen-Macaulay algebras $R \mapsto B$, that the associated big Cohen-Macaulay closure operation on ideals $I \mapsto I B \cap R$ necessarily satisfies the Brian\c{c}on-Skoda type property. The proof combines arguments of Lipman-Teissier, Hochster, Ma, and Hochster-Huneke. Specializing to mixed characteristic, and utilizing a result of Bhatt on absolute integral closures, this recovers a slight strengthening of a result of Heitmann.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes and matroids with vanishing $T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quotients by radical monomial ideals for which $T^2$, the second cotangent cohomology module, vanishes. The dimension of the graded components of $T^2$, and thus their vanishing, depends only on the combinatorics of the corresponding simplicial complex. We give both a complete characterization and a full list of one dimensional complexes with $T^2=0$. We characterize the graded components of $T^2$ when the simplicial complex is a uniform matroid. Finally, we show that $T^2$ vanishes for all matroids of corank at most two and conjecture that all connected matroids with vanishing $T^2$ are of corank at most two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deformations of certain crepant resolutions of isolated rational Gorenstein singularities. After a general discussion of the deformation theory, we specialize to dimension three and consider examples which are good (log) resolutions as well as the case of small resolutions. We obtain some partial results on the classification of canonical threefold singularities that admit good crepant resolutions. Finally, we study a non-crepant example, the blowup of a small resolution whose exceptional set is a smooth curve.</description>

      <title>Surface counterexamples to the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Eisenbud-Goto regularity conjecture is true for arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay varieties, projective curves, smooth surfaces, smooth threefolds in $\mathbb{P}^5$, and toric varieties of codimension two. After J. McCullough and I. Peeva constructed counterexamples in 2018, it has been an interesting question to find the categories such that the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture holds. So far, surface counterexamples have not been found while counterexamples of any dimension greater or equal to 3 are known.
  In this paper, we construct counterexamples to the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture for projective surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^4$ and investigate projective invariants, cohomological properties, and geometric properties. The counterexamples are constructed via binomial rational maps between projective spaces.</description>

Abstract: Brandhorst and Shimada described a large class of Enriques surfaces, called $(\tau,\overline{\tau})$-generic, for which they gave generators for the automorphism groups and calculated the elliptic fibrations and the smooth rational curves up to automorphisms. In the present paper, we give lower bounds for the non-degeneracy invariant of such Enriques surfaces, we show that in most cases the invariant has generic value $10$, and we present the first known example of complex Enriques surface with infinite automorphism group and non-degeneracy invariant not equal to $10$.</description>

      <title>Differentiable approximation of continuous definable maps that preserves the image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Paw\l{}ucki showed that compact sets that are definable in some o-minimal structure admit triangulations of class $\mathcal{C}^p$ for each integer $p\geq 1$. In this work, we make use of these new techniques of triangulation to show that all continuous definable maps between compact definable sets can be approximated by differentiable maps without changing their image after the approximation. The argument is an interplay between o-minimal geometry and PL geometry and makes use of a `surjective definable version' of the finite simplicial approximation theorem that we prove here.</description>

      <title>Curves with Jacobian syzygies of the same degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this notes we study complex projective plane curves whose graded module of Jacobian syzygies is generated by its minimal degree component. Examples of such curves include the smooth curves as well as the maximal Tjurina curves. However, this class of curves seems to be surprisingly large. In particular, any line arrangement $\mathcal A$ of $d=2k+1\geq 5 $ lines having only double and triple points is in this class if the number of triple points is $k$ and if they are all situated on a line $L \in \mathcal A$, see Theorem 6.2</description>

Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

Abstract: Let $P\to X$ be a ${\mathbb P}^1$-bundle over a variety $X$. The aim of this note is to understand all connected, algebraic groups $$ \operatorname{Aut}^\circ(P)\subset G\subset \operatorname{Bir}( X\times {\mathbb P}^1). $$ We get a quite complete answer if $\operatorname{Aut}^\circ(X)$ is a maximal, connected, algebraic subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir}(X)$, and $P$ is sufficiently unstable.
  This gives examples of connected, algebraic subgroups of $\operatorname{Bir}({\mathbb P}^4)$ that are not contained in any maximal one.

      <title>Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of matroid Chow rings and intersection cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hilbert series of four objects arising in the Chow-theoretic and Kazhdan-Lusztig framework of matroids. These are, respectively, the Hilbert series of the Chow ring, the augmented Chow ring, the intersection cohomology module, and its stalk at the empty flat. We develop a parallelism between the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a matroid and the Hilbert series of its Chow ring. This extends to a parallelism between the $Z$-polynomial of a matroid and the Hilbert series of its augmented Chow ring. This suggests to bring ideas from one framework to the other. Our two main motivations are the real-rootedness conjecture for all of these polynomials, and the problem of computing them. We provide several intrinsic definitions of these invariants; also, by leveraging that they are valuations under matroid polytope subdivisions, we deduce a fast way for computing them for a large class of matroids. Uniform matroids are a case of combinatorial interest; we link the resulting polynomials with certain real-rooted families such as the (binomial) Eulerian polynomials, and we settle a conjecture of Hameister, Rao, and Simpson. Furthermore, we prove the real-rootedness of the Hilbert series of the augmented Chow rings of uniform matroids via a result of Haglund and Zhang; and in addition, we prove a version of a conjecture of Gedeon in the Chow setting: uniform matroids maximize coefficient-wisely these polynomials for matroids with fixed rank and size. By relying on the nonnegativity of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the semi-small decompositions of Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot, and Wang, we strengthen the unimodality of the Hilbert series of Chow rings, augmented Chow rings, and intersection cohomologies to $\gamma$-positivity, a property for palindromic polynomials that lies between unimodality and real-rootedness; this settles a conjecture of Ferroni, Nasr, and Vecchi.</description>

      <title>Berry Connections for 2d $(2,2)$ Theories, Monopole Spectral Data &amp; (Generalised) Cohomology Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Berry connections for supersymmetric ground states of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSMs quantised on a circle, which are generalised periodic monopoles. Periodic monopole solutions may be encoded into difference modules, as shown by Mochizuki, or into an alternative algebraic construction given in terms of vector bundles endowed with filtrations. By studying the ground states in terms of a one-parameter family of supercharges, we relate these two different kinds of spectral data to the physics of the GLSMs. From the difference modules we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes, which in the conformal limit yield novel difference equations for hemisphere or vortex partition functions. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the two kinds of spectral data are related to different (generalised) cohomology theories: the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, whereas the vector bundles with filtrations are related to its equivariant K-theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the class of differentially henselian fields, which are henselian valued fields equipped with generic derivations in the sense of Cubides Kovacics and Point, and are special cases of differentially large fields in the sense of Le\'on S\'anchez and Tressl. We prove that many results from henselian valued fields as well as differentially large fields can be lifted to the differentially henselian setting, for instance Ax-Kochen/Ershov principles, characterisations in terms of differential algebras, etc. We also give methods to concretely construct such fields in terms of iterated power series expansions and inductive constructions on transcendence bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem of Hirzebruch, we study $8$-dimensional, closed, symplectic manifolds having a Hamiltonian torus action with isolated fixed points and second Betti number equal to $1$. Such manifolds are automatically positive monotone. Our main result concerns those endowed with a Hamiltonian $T^2$-action and fourth Betti number equal to $2$. We classify their isotropy data, (equivariant) cohomology rings and (equivariant) Chern classes, and prove that they agree with those of certain explicit Fano $4$-folds with torus actions. Moreover, under more general assumptions, we prove several finiteness results concerning Betti and Chern numbers of $8$-dimensional, positive monotone symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian torus action.</description>
