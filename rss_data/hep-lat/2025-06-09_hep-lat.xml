      <title>Real-time Estimators for Scattering Observables: A full account of finite volume errors for quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time correlators of quantum field theories can be directly probed through new approaches to simulation, such as quantum computing and tensor networks. This provides a new framework for computing scattering observables in lattice formulations of strongly interacting theories, such as lattice quantum chromodynamics. In this paper, we prove that the proposal of real-time estimators of scattering observables is universally applicable to all scattering observables of gapped quantum field theories. All finite-volume errors are exponentially suppressed, and the rate of this suppression is controlled by the regulator considered, namely, a displacement of the spectrum of the theory into the complex plane. A partial restoration of Lorentz symmetry by averaging over different boosts gives an additional suppression of finite volume errors. Our results also apply to the simulation of wavepacket scattering, where a similar averaging is performed to construct the wavepackets that regulate the finite volume effects. We also comment on potential applications of our results to traditional computational schemes.</description>

      <title>Application of quantum machine learning using variational quantum classifier in accelerator physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning algorithms aim to take advantage of quantum computing to improve classical machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we have applied a quantum machine learning algorithm, the variational quantum classifier for the first time in accelerator physics. Specifically, we utilized the variational quantum classifier to evaluate the dynamic aperture of a diffraction-limited storage ring. It has been demonstrated that the variational quantum classifier can achieve good accuracy much faster than the classical artificial neural network, with the statistics of training samples increasing. And the accuracy of the variational quantum classifier is always higher than that of an artificial neural network, although they are very close when the statistics of training samples reach high. Furthermore, we have investigated the impact of noise on the variational quantum classifier, and found that the variational quantum classifier maintains robust performance even in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Bloch Waves, Magnetization and Domain Walls: The Case of the Gluon Propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand our previous study [1] of replicated gauge configurations in lattice SU(Nc) Yang-Mills theory -- employing Bloch's theorem, from condensed-matter physics -- to construct gauge-fixed field configurations on significantly larger lattices than the original, or primitive, one. We present a comprehensive discussion of the general gauge-fixing problem, identifying advantages of the replicated-lattice approach. In particular, the consideration of Bloch waves leads us to a visualization of the extended gauge-fixed configurations in terms of (color) magnetization domains. Moreover, we are able to explore features of the method to optimize the evaluation of gauge fields in momentum space, furthering our knowledge of the ``allowed momenta'', an issue that has hindered wider applications of this approach up to now. Interestingly, our analysis yields both a better conceptual understanding of the problem and a more efficient way to compute the desired large-volume observables.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule study on excited light meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24376v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the QCD sum rule method to systematically study excited light meson operators and calculate their decay constants. These operators are constructed by explicitly adding one covariant derivative to the quark-antiquark pair. In total, twelve such operators are constructed, among which ten are subjected to detailed numerical analyses. The considered quark contents include $\bar{q}q$, $\bar{q}s$, and $\bar{s}s$ ($q = u/d$), allowing the formation of various $SU(3)$ flavor nonets. For instance, our results support the interpretation that the $a_2(1320)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2^\prime(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ constitute a flavor nonet with quantum numbers $J^{P(C)} = 2^{+(+)}$. In addition, we predict several excited meson states, whose masses and decay constants are determined using the QCD sum rule method.</description>

      <title>2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods: Order conditions, general properties and some analytic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-storage Runge-Kutta schemes of Williamson's type, so-called 2N-storage schemes, are examined. Explicit 2N-storage constraints are derived for the first time and used to establish new relations between the entries of the Butcher tableau. An error in the Williamson's formula for converting coefficients between the standard and 2N-storage formats in the special case is pointed out and corrected. The new relations are used to derive a closed-form solution for four- and five-stage 2N-storage methods with the third order of global accuracy. Several new four- and five-stage schemes with rational coefficients are presented and numerically examined for illustration.</description>

      <title>Three-loop QCD Mass Relation between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and Symmetric-momentum Subtraction Scheme Away from the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perturbative result for the quark-mass conversion factor between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and regularization-independent symmetric-momentum subtraction scheme (RI/SMOM) away from the chiral limit, i.e. at non-zero quark masses (RI/mSMOM), is derived up to three loops in QCD, extending the existing result by two additional orders. We further explore an illuminating possibility that in Dimensional Regularization, the original RI/(m)SMOM renormalization conditions may be interpreted merely in a weaker sense, namely as equations holding just in the 4-dimensional limit rather than exactly in $d$ dimensions: they work and result in different, albeit simpler, renormalization constants but still the same finite conversion factor. This novel observation has the added benefit of reducing computational effort, particularly at high orders. Furthermore we show that the two renormalization conditions considered for the scalar operator yield factors differing from the pseudoscalar case beyond one loop, but both converge to the latter in the chiral limit. Lastly, our result for the conversion factor exhibits rich behaviors, and in particular a window is observed in the subtraction scale and mass where it receives less perturbative corrections than the RI/SMOM counterpart up to three loops; this finding may help to further improve the accuracy of $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ quark-mass determinations with Lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the mystery of $X(3872)$ with the coupled-channel dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $X(3872)$, as the first and the most crucial member in the exotic charmoniumlike $XYZ$ family, has been studied for a long time. However, its dynamical origin, whether stemming from a $D\bar{D}^*$ hadronic molecule or the first excited $P$-wave charmonium $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, remains controversial. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the $X(3872)$ definitely does not result from the mass shift of the higher bare $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ resonance pole in the coupled-channel dynamics involving a short-distance $c\bar{c}$ core and the long-distance $D\bar{D}^*$ channels. Instead, it originates from either the $D\bar{D}^*$ molecular pole or the shadow pole associated with the anti-resonance of the $P$-wave charmonium, depending on the weak or strong coupling mode, respectively. To differentiate these origins and fully exploit the nature of $X(3872)$, we conduct a comprehensive analysis in a couple-channel dynamics framework, including the isospin violation, the three-body $D\bar{D}\pi$ effect, the dynamical width of $D^*$, and non-open-charm decays of the bare $\chi_{c1}(2P)$. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the coupled-channel dynamics in explaining the disparity between the pole widths of $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}^+$, while also predicting a new resonance with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ around 4.0 GeV. By matching the newly observed $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ by the LHCb Collaboration to our predicted resonance, we conclude that the $X(3872)$ most likely originates from the $D\bar{D}^*$ pole with a confidence level exceeding $99.7\%$.</description>

      <title>On the pole trajectory of the subthreshold negative parity nucleon with varying pion masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pole trajectory of the recently established subthreshold negative parity nucleon pole, namely the $N^*(920)$, with varying pion masses, in the scheme of linear $\sigma$ model with nucleons using the $N/D$ unitarization method. We find that as the pion mass increases, the pole moves toward the real axis. For larger pion masses, at tree level, the pole falls to a specific point on $u$-channel cut and crosses to the adjacent Riemann sheet defined by the logarithmic $u$ channel cut. At one-loop level, the pole does not meet the $u$-cut up to $m_\pi=0.36$GeV. We also re-examined the $\sigma$ pole trajectory and find it in good agreement with Roy equation analysis result.</description>

      <title>The charming case of $X(3872)$ and $\chi_{c1}(2P)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than twenty years have elapsed since the discovery of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ (previously denoted as $X(3872)$), and an impressive amount of theoretical and experimental studies has been devoted to its properties, decays and production mechanisms. Despite the extensive work, a full understanding of the nature of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is still missing. In the present study we reconsider a theoretical framework based on the heavy quark large mass limit to analyse the radiative decays of heavy quarkonia, in particular the electric dipole transitions of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ to S-wave charmonia. The results favourably compare to recent measurements for $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, obtained by the LHCb Collaboration, if this meson is identified with $\chi_{c1}(2P)$.</description>
