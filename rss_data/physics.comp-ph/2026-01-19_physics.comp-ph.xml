      <title>Learning collision operators from plasma phase space data using differentiable simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to infer collision operators from phase space data of plasma dynamics. Our approach combines a differentiable kinetic simulator, whose core component in this work is a differentiable Fokker-Planck solver, with a gradient-based optimisation method to learn the collisional operators that best describe the phase space dynamics. We test our method using data from two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations of spatially uniform thermal plasmas, and learn the collision operator that captures the self-consistent electromagnetic interaction between finite-size charged particles over a wide variety of simulation parameters. We demonstrate that the learned operators are more accurate than alternative estimates based on particle tracks, while making no prior assumptions about the relevant time-scales of the processes and significantly reducing memory requirements. We find that the retrieved operators, obtained in the non-relativistic regime, are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions derived for electrostatic scenarios. Our results show that differentiable simulators offer a powerful and computational efficient approach to infer novel operators for a wide rage of problems, such as electromagnetically dominated collisional dynamics and stochastic wave-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>A numerical study on the effect of rolling friction on clogging of pores in particle-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particulate matter in a fluid injected into a porous reservoir impairs its permeability spatio-temporally due to pore clogging. As particle volume fraction increases near the pore throats, inter-particle contact mechanics determine their jamming and subsequent pore clogging behavior. During contact of particles submerged in a fluid, in addition to sliding friction, a rolling resistance develops due to a several micromechanical and hydrodynamic factors. A coefficient of rolling friction is often used as a lumped parameter to characterize particle rigidity, particle shape, lubrication and fluid mediated resistance, however its direct influence on the clogging behavior is not well studied in literature. We study the effect of rolling resistance on the clogging behavior of a dense suspension at pore scale using direct numerical simulations (DNS). A discrete element method (DEM) library is developed and coupled with an open-source immersed boundary method (IBM) based solver to perform pore and particle resolved simulations. Several 3D validations are presented for the DEM library and the DEM-IBM coupling and the effect of rolling resistance on clogging at a pore entry is studied.</description>

      <title>NAVIS: A LAMMPS-Python framework for efficient computation of nanochannel velocity and thermal interfacial slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present NAVIS (NAnochannel Velocity and thermal Interfacial Slip), a LAMMPS-Python scripted toolkit for computing the Navier (hydrodynamic) friction coefficient and Kapitza (thermal) resistance at arbitrary solid-fluid interfaces. NAVIS is based on equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) methods for calculating the linear response friction and thermal resistance at the interface, as well as the corresponding velocity and temperature slips. The methodology is based on our previous studies (Hansen, et al., Phys. Rev. E 84, 016313 (2011); Varghese et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 184707 (2021); Alosious, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 194502 (2019); Alosious, et al., Langmuir 37, 2355-2361 (2021)), and in this work we provide a pedagogical framework for the implementation of this toolkit on two systems: (i) a water-graphene system (for hydrodynamic slip) and (ii) a water-CNT system (for thermal slip). We provide detailed instructions for performing the EMD simulations using the LAMMPS package and processing the simulation outputs using Python modules to obtain the desired quantities of interest. We expect the toolkit to be useful for computational researchers studying interfacial friction and thermal transport, key factors for efficient and practical applications of nanofluidic systems.</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of stretched bond errors: Extending the analysis of Perdew-Zunger self-interaction corrections of reaction barrier heights beyond the LSDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating self-interaction corrections (SIC) significantly improves chemical reaction barrier height predictions made using density functional theory methods. We present a detailed, orbital-by-orbital analysis of these corrections for three semi-local density functional approximations (DFAs) situated on the three lowest rungs of the Jacob's Ladder of approximations. The analysis is based on Fermi-L\"owdin Orbital Self-Interaction Correction calculations performed at several steps along the reaction pathway from the reactants (R) to the transition state (TS) to the products (P) for four representative reactions selected from the BH76 benchmark set. For all three functionals, the major contribution to self-interaction corrections of the barrier heights can be traced to stretched bond orbitals that develop near the TS configuration. The magnitude of the ratio of the self-exchange-correlation energy to the self-Hartree energy (XC/H) for a given orbital is introduced as an indicator of one-electron self-interaction error. For the exact, but unknown density functional, XC/H = 1.0 for all orbitals, while for the practical DFAs studied here, XC/H spans a range of values. The largest values are obtained for stretched or strongly lobed orbitals. We show that significant differences in XC/H for corresponding orbitals in the R, TS, and P configurations can be used to identify the major contributors to the SIC of barrier heights and reaction energies. Based on such comparisons, we suggest that barrier height predictions made using the SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation may have attained the best accuracy possible for a semi-local functional using the Perdew-Zunger SIC approach.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity and Self-Organization in an Exponential Dense Associative Memory Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.</description>

      <title>Complex Valued Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) $[\mathcal{G}]$ for Three Dimensional Maxwell's Equations: $\mathcal{G} \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations, a system of linear partial differential equations (PDEs), describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in time and space and are essential for many important electromagnetic applications. Although numerical methods have been applied successfully in the past, the primary challenge in solving these equations arises from the frequency of electromagnetic fields, which depends on the shape and size of the objects to be resolved. Since the domain of influence for these equations is compactly supported, even a small perturbation in frequency necessitates a new discretization of Maxwell's equations, resulting in substantial computational costs. In this work, we investigate the potential of neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and its variants, as a surrogate model for Maxwell's equations. Existing DeepONet implementations are restricted to real-valued data in $R^n$, but since the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations yield solutions in the complex domain $C^n$, a specialized architecture is required to handle complex algebra. We propose a formulation of DeepONet for complex data, define the forward pass in the complex domain, and adopt a reparametrized version of DeepONet for more efficient training. We also propose a unified framework to combine a plurality of DeepONets, trained for multiple electromagnetic field components, to incorporate the boundary condition. We conduct computational experiments on a 3D metallic sphere without singularities and on a metallic almond-shaped target to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for problems involving singularity-prone solutions. As shown by computational experiments, our method significantly enhances the efficiency of predicting scattered fields from a spherical object at arbitrary high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Self-Assembled Monolayers of Polyalanine $\alpha$-Helices: Development and Application of an Effective Potential for Film Structure Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembled monolayers of polyalanine $\alpha$-helices exhibit distinct structural phases with implications for chiral-induced spin selectivity. We combine scanning tunneling microscopy and theoretical modeling to reveal how chiral composition governs supramolecular organization. Enantiopure systems form hexagonal lattices, while racemic mixtures organize into rectangular phases with stripe-like features. Our interaction potentials derived from density-functional based tight binding calculations show that opposite-handed helix pairs exhibit stronger binding and closer packing, explaining the denser racemic structures. Crucially, we demonstrate that the observed STM contrast arises from anti-parallel alignment of opposite-handed helices rather than physical height variations. These findings establish fundamental structure-property relationships for designing peptide-based spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport (FEAT), a novel framework for free energy estimation -- a critical challenge across scientific domains. FEAT leverages learned transports implemented via stochastic interpolants and provides consistent, minimum-variance estimators based on escorted Jarzynski equality and controlled Crooks theorem, alongside variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences. Unifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods under a single theoretical framework, FEAT establishes a principled foundation for neural free energy calculations. Experimental validation on toy examples, molecular simulations, and quantum field theory demonstrates improvements over existing learning-based methods. Our PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/jiajunhe98/FEAT.</description>

      <title>A general model for frictional contacts in colloidal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In simulations of colloidal matter, frictional contacts between particles are often neglected. For spherical colloids, such an approximation can be problematic, since frictional contacts couple translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which may affect the collective behavior of, e.g., colloids under shear and chiral active matter. Deterministic models for frictional contacts have been proposed in the granular matter community. On the colloidal scale, however, thermal fluctuations are important and should be included in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Here, we derive the correct fluctuation-dissipation relation for linear and nonlinear instantaneous frictional contact interactions. Among other, this generates a new generalized class of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats with rotation-translation coupling. We demonstrate effects of frictional contact interactions using the examples of Poiseuille flow and motility induced phase separation in active Langevin particles.</description>

      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>
