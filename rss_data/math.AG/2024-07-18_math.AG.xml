      <title>Strong u-invariant and Period-Index bound for complete ultrametric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a complete ultrametric valued field. Let u($k$) (resp. u_s($k$)) denote the u-invariant (resp. the strong u-invariant) of $k$. We give a description of this invariant for $k$ in terms of the u-invariant (resp. the strong u-invariant) of its residue field. Let $C$ be a curve over $k$ and $F$ = $k(C)$. We prove similar results for the u-invariant of $F$. For $l$ a prime away from the characteristic of the residue field of $k$, we obtain bounds for the Brauer-$l$-dimensions of $k$ and $F$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Winding Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new algebraic winding number and prove that it computes the number of complex roots of a polynomial in a rectangle, including roots on edges or vertices with appropriate counting. The definition makes sense for the algebraic closure C = R[i] of a real closed field R, and the root counting result also holds in this case. We study in detail the properties of the algebraic winding number defined in [3] with respect to complex root counting in rectangles. We extend both winding numbers to rational functions, obtaining then algebraic versions of the argument principle for rectangles.</description>

      <title>The geometric concentration theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a purely geometric form of the concentration theorem (also called localization theorem) for actions of a linearly reductive group $G$ on an affine scheme $X$ over an affine base scheme $S$. It asserts the existence of a $G$-representation without trivial summand over $S$, which acquires over $X$ an equivariant section vanishing precisely at the fixed locus of $X$.
  As a consequence, we show that the equivariant stable motivic homotopy theory of a scheme with an action of a linearly reductive group is equivalent to that of the fixed locus, upon inverting appropriate maps, namely the Euler classes of representations without trivial summands. We also discuss consequences for equivariant cohomology theories obtained using Borel's construction. This recovers most known forms of the concentration theorem in algebraic geometry, and yields generalizations valid beyond the setting of actions of diagonalizable groups on one hand, and that of oriented cohomology theories on the other hand.
  Finally, we derive a version of Smith theory for motivic cohomology, following the approach of Dwyer--Wilkerson in topology.</description>

      <title>Cancellation and splitting of Symplectic modules in the critical range and Euler class group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we shall discuss the cancellation of symplectic modules and the splitting of symplectic modules. The symplectic cancellation can be thought of as a projective module cancellation which is a recent result of Fasel. The symplectic splitting is similar to Murthy's splitting theorem. To prove the cancellation and splitting, we shall carefully analyze the Postnikov towers in the $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category. Then we shall prove the vanishing of top cohomology with coefficients in some homotopy sheaf. As another application of the vanishing results, we answer partially a question of Mrinal Das about the isomorphism of $(d-1)$-th Euler class group and $(d-1)$-th Chow group, where $d$ is the dimension of the underlying smooth affine variety.</description>

      <title>Hodge Theory of Abelian Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by classical Alexander invariants of affine hypersurface complements, we endow certain finite dimensional quotients of the homology of abelian covers of complex algebraic varieties with a canonical and functorial mixed Hodge structure (MHS). More precisely, we focus on covers which arise algebraically in the following way: if $U$ is a smooth connected complex algebraic variety and $G$ is a complex semiabelian variety, the pullback of the exponential map by an algebraic morphism $f:U\to G$ yields a covering space $\pi:U^f\to U$ whose group of deck transformations is $\pi_1(G)$. The new MHSs are compatible with Deligne's MHS on the homology of $U$ through the covering map $\pi$ and satisfy a direct sum decomposition as MHSs into generalized eigenspaces by the action of deck transformations. This provides a vast generalization of the previous results regarding univariable Alexander modules by Geske, Maxim, Wang and the authors. Lastly, we reduce the problem of whether the first Betti number of the Milnor fiber of a central hyperplane arrangement complement is combinatorial to a question about the Hodge filtration of certain MHSs defined in this paper, providing evidence that the new structures contain interesting information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Saito  gave a nice and efficient criterion to determine whether the module of logarithmic derivation associated with a reduced divisor in a complex variety is free or not. The aim of this note is to propose a new proof of this criterion, in the affine space, in the projective space, and for multiderivations, based on straightforward observations concerning free and reflexive modules. This point of view also allows us to prove a generalized version of the Saito criterion that applies to derivation modules associated with several polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $F$-gauges for de Rham cohomology of smooth algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$. Applying to good reductions of Shimura varieties of Hodge type, we recover the Ekedahl-Oort stratifications by constructing universal de Rham $F$-gauges with $G$-structure. We also study the cohomology of de Rham $F$-gauges on these varieties. In particular, in the PEL type case and when the weights of the flat automorphic vector bundles are $p$-small, we determine the $F$-gauge structure on their de Rham cohomology by the associated dual BGG complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results of A.Chiodo, Y.Ruan and M.Krawitz associate the mirror partner Calabi-Yau variety $X$ to a Landau--Ginzburg orbifold $(f,G)$ if $f$ is an invertible polynomial satisfying Calabi-Yau condition and the group $G$ is a diagonal symmetry group of $f$. In this paper we investigate the Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds with a Klein quartic polynomial $f = x_1^3x_2 + x_2^3x_3+x_3^3x_1$ and $G$ being all possible subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbb{C})$, preserving the polynomial $f$ and also the pairing in its Jacobian algebra. In particular, $G$ is not necessarily abelian or diagonal. The zero-set of polynomial $f$, called Klein quartic, is a genus $3$ smooth compact Riemann surface. We show that its mirror Landau-Ginzburg orbifold is $(f,G)$ with $G$ being a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-extension of a Klein four-group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_1, A_2,A_3$ be semisimple objects in a neutral tannakian category over a field of characteristic zero. Let $L$ be an extension of $A_2$ by $A_1$, and $N$ an extension of $A_3$ by $A_2$. Let $M$ be a blended extension (extension panach\'ee) of $N$ by $L$. Under very mild and natural hypotheses, we study the unipotent radical of the tannakian fundamental group of $M$. Examples where our results apply include the unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups of any mixed motive with three weights.
  As an application, we give a proof of the unipotent part of the Hodge-Nori conjecture for 1-motives (which is now a theorem of Andr\'e in the setting of Nori motives) in the setting of any tannakian category of motives where the group $Ext^1(1,\mathbb{Q}(1))$ is as expected.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a diagonal cubic form over $\mathbb{Z}$ in $6$ variables. From the dual variety in the delta method of Duke--Friedlander--Iwaniec and Heath-Brown, we unconditionally extract a weighted count of certain special integral zeros of $F$ in regions of diameter $X \to \infty$. Heath-Brown did the same in $4$ variables, but our analysis differs and captures some novel features. We also put forth an axiomatic framework for more general $F$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantization of the canonical unshifted Poisson structure on the derived cotangent stack $T^\ast[X/G]$ of a quotient stack, where $X$ is a smooth affine scheme with an action of a (reductive) smooth affine group scheme $G$. This is achieved through an {\'e}tale resolution of $T^\ast[X/G]$ by stacky CDGAs that allows for an explicit description of the canonical Poisson structure on $T^\ast[X/G]$ and of the dg-category of modules quantizing it. These techniques are applied to construct a dg-category-valued prefactorization algebra that quantizes a gauge theory on directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten invariants in complex and Morava-local $K$-theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a closed symplectic manifold $X$, we construct Gromov-Witten-type invariants valued both in (complex) $K$-theory and in any complex-oriented cohomology theory $\mathbb{K}$ which is $K_p(n)$-local for some Morava $K$-theory $K_p(n)$. We show that these invariants satisfy a version of the Kontsevich-Manin axioms, extending Givental and Lee's work for the quantum $K$-theory of complex projective algebraic varieties. In particular, we prove a Gromov-Witten type splitting axiom, and hence define quantum $K$-theory and quantum $\mathbb{K}$-theory as commutative deformations of the corresponding (generalised) cohomology rings of $X$; the definition of the quantum product involves the formal group of the underlying cohomology theory. The key geometric input to these results is a construction of global Kuranishi charts for moduli spaces of stable maps of arbitrary genus to $X$. On the algebraic side, in order to establish a common framework covering both ordinary $K$-theory and $K_p(n)$-local theories, we introduce a formalism of `counting theories' for enumerative invariants on a category of global Kuranishi charts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generic link of an unmixed radical ideal is radical (in fact, prime). We show that the squarefreeness of the initial ideal and $F$-purity are not preserved along generic links. However, for several important cases in liaison theory, including generic height three Gorenstein ideals and the maximal minors of a generic matrix, we show that the squarefreeness of the initial ideal, $F$-purity, and the $F$-pure threshold are each preserved along generic links by identifying a property of such ideals which propagates along generic links. We use this property to establish the $F$-regularity of the generic links of such ideals. Finally, we study the $F$-pure threshold of the generic residual intersections of a complete intersection ideal and answer a related question of Kim--Miller--Niu.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives a full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples.</description>
