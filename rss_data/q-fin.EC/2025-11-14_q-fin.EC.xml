      <title>AI in the Pen: How Real-time AI Writing Guidance Shapes Online Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping user-generated content (UGC). Online reviews, an important form of UGC, exert significant influence on consumer decisions and business reputation. Yet, the impacts of AI-powered tools employed during review generation remain underexplored. We examine Yelp's AI writing guidance adopted in April 2023, a novel human-AI collaboration in content creation. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, we evaluate the impacts of this intervention on review outcomes. Our findings reveal that, first, the AI guidance was effective in shaping topical composition, encouraging broader coverage across aspects of the dining experience. Second, the AI writing guidance increases review length while reducing overall review volume, revealing a trade-off between depth and productivity. Third, the expansion of topic coverage comes at the cost of increased textual complexity and reduced readability, ultimately diminishing the number of helpfulness votes. Lastly, effects are heterogeneous: less experienced users expand length and topic coverage more, whereas experienced users exhibit greater complexity and sharper declines in perceived helpfulness. These findings advance our understanding of AI-powered tools during content generation. We also discuss implications for platforms aiming to leverage AI in managing online content and for other stakeholders involved in the production and consumption of online content.</description>

      <title>Modelos Empiricos de Pos-Dupla Selecao por LASSO: Discussoes para Estudos do Transporte Aereo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and discusses forms of estimation by regularized regression and model selection using the LASSO method - Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. LASSO is recognized as one of the main supervised learning methods applied to high-dimensional econometrics, allowing work with large volumes of data and multiple correlated controls. Conceptual issues related to the consequences of high dimensionality in modern econometrics and the principle of sparsity, which underpins regularization procedures, are addressed. The study examines the main post-double selection and post-regularization models, including variations applied to instrumental variable models. A brief description of the lassopack routine package, its syntaxes, and examples of HD, HDS (High-Dimension Sparse), and IV-HDS models, with combinations involving fixed effects estimators, is also presented. Finally, the potential application of the approach in research focused on air transport is discussed, with emphasis on an empirical study on the operational efficiency of airlines and aircraft fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>What Benefits Drive Membership in Medicare Advantage Plans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We seek to identify the most relevant benefits offered by Medicare Advantage Health Plans that drive membership and market share. As an example, we explore plans operating in a single county in New Jersey between 2018 and 2023. A dataset of benefits from publicly available data sources was created and the variance inflation factor was applied to identify the correlation between the extracted features, to avoid multicollinearity and overparameterization problems. We categorized the variable Market Share and used it as a multinomial response variable with three categories: less than 0.3\%, 0.3\% to 1.5\%, and over 1.5\%. Categories were chosen to achieve approximately uniform distribution of plans (47, 60, and 65 respectively). We built a multinomial Lasso model using 5-fold cross-validation to tune the penalty parameter. Lasso forced some features to be dropped from the model, which reduces the risk of overfitting and increases the interpretability of the results. For each category, important variables are different. Certain brands drive market share, as do PPO plans and prescription drug coverage. Benefits, particularly ancillary benefits that are not part of CMS's required benefits, appear to have little influence, while financial terms such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket limits are associated with higher market share. Finally, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of the Lasso model with the test set. The accuracy is 0.76.</description>
