      <title>Antiholomorphic correspondences and mating II: Shabat polynomial slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study natural one-parameter families of antiholomorphic correspondences arising from univalent restrictions of Shabat polynomials, indexed by rooted dessin d'enfants. We prove that the parameter spaces are topological quadrilaterals, giving a partial description of the univalency loci for the uniformizing Shabat polynomials. We show that the escape loci of our parameter spaces are naturally (real-analytically) uniformized by disks. We proceed with designing a puzzle structure (dual to the indexing dessin) for non-renormalizable maps, yielding combinatorial rigidity in these classes. Then we develop a renormalization theory for pinched (anti-)polynomial-like maps in order to describe all combinatorial Multibrot and Multicorn copies contained in our connectedness loci (a curious feature of these parameter spaces is the presence of multiple period one copies). Finally, we construct locally connected combinatorial models for the connectedness loci into which the indexing dessins naturally embed.</description>

      <title>Random attractor and SRB measure for stochastic Hopf bifurcation under discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic phases in stochastic differential equations are characterized by two essential long-time dynamical features: a random attractor capturing asymptotic geometry and a Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure describing statistical information. This paper investigates whether the stochastic Hopf bifurcation under discretization could inherit both features. We establish that the stochastic Hopf bifurcation under discretization induces a discrete random dynamical system. Further, we prove that this discrete system possesses a random attractor, and then derive the existence of an SRB measure by demonstrating a strictly positive numerical Lyapunov exponent. Numerical experiments visualize the retained random attractor and SRB measure for the discrete random dynamical system, revealing structures consistent with the theoretical chaotic phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study degenerate singular points of planar vector fields inside a (degenerated) flow-box. These kind of singularities are called fake saddles and their linear parts are always zero. We characterize fake saddles with non-zero second order jet and we give the first term of an uniform asymptotic expansion of the Poincar\'e map between two transverse sections to their corresponding singular fiber, determining its stability.</description>

      <title>Doubling bifurcations of invariant closed curves in 3D maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported two types of doubling of invariant closed curves (ICCs) in dynamical systems: (a) the creation of two disjoint ICCs such that iterations flip between them; and (b) the creation of a single ICC of double the length of the original ICC. Various methods have been proposed to analyze such bifurcations. We show that the methods proposed so far are not always adequate for analyzing and predicting these bifurcations. We propose a new method to overcome the difficulties.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff attractors for dissipative symplectic billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to propose and study a dissipative variant of symplectic billiards within planar strictly convex domains. The associated billiard map is dissipative, thus it admits a compact invariant set, the so-called Birkhoff attractor. Its complexity depends on the rate of the dissipation as well as on the geometry of the billiard table. We prove that (a) for strong dissipation, the Birkhoff attractor is a normally contracted graph over the zero section; (b) for mild dissipation, the Birkhoff attractor within a centrally symmetric domain is an indecomposable continuum whose restricted dynamics has positive topological entropy. We compare these results with the case of dissipative Birkhoff billiards, studied in a paper by Bernardi-Florio-Leguil</description>

      <title>Investigating the Performance of EKF, UKF, and PF for Quadrotor Position Estimation in Hurricane Wind Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and typhoons, pose significant challenges to public safety and infrastructure. While government agencies rely on multi million dollar UAV systems for storm data collection and disaster response, smaller drones lack the ability to autonomously adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions, such as turbulent winds. This project investigates the implementation of advanced state estimation filters, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and Particle Filter (PF), to enhance the control and adaptability of quadrotor drones in uncertain wind profiles modeled by Von Karman turbulence. While the EKF relies on linearization techniques using the Taylor series expansion, which can struggle under high nonlinearity, the UKF leverages sigma points for better performance in nonlinear systems without requiring Jacobian computations. The PF, on the other hand, addresses non-Gaussian noise and severe nonlinearities by employing a large number of particles, albeit at a high computational cost. To enhance accuracy and minimize estimation errors, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to optimally tune the process and measurement noise covariances (Q and R matrices) as well as UKF specific parameters alpha, beta, and kappa. This study highlights the tradeoff between accuracy, computational efficiency, and smoothing capabilities across these filters. Despite its robustness, the PF suffered from computational inefficiencies due to the high state dimensionality, while the EKF demonstrated faster computation but lower adaptability in nonlinear conditions. The UKF emerged as a balanced approach, achieving superior performance in capturing dynamic wind disturbances.</description>

      <title>Heavy repulsion of clusters in Bernoulli percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Bernoulli$(p)$ percolation on (non)unimodular quasi-transitive graphs and prove that, almost surely, for any two heavy clusters $C$ and $C'$, the set of vertices in $C$ within distance one of $C'$ is light, i.e. it has finite total weight. This is a significant step towards resolving a longstanding question posed by H\"aggstr\"om, Peres, and Schonmann, and a generalization of a theorem of Tim\'ar, who proved the same result in the unimodular setting. Our proof adapts Tim\'ar's approach but requires developing weighted analogues of several classical unimodular results. This presents nontrivial challenges, since in a nonunimodular graph a subtree with infinitely many ends may be hyperfinite or even light. To overcome this, we employ newly developed machinery from the theory of measure-class-preserving equivalence relations and graphs. In particular, we establish a weighted generalization of a theorem of Benjamini, Lyons, and Schramm on the existence of an invariant random subgraph with positive weighted Cheeger constant, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a behavioral-feedback SIR model in which the infection rate adapts dynamically based on the fractions of susceptible and infected individuals. We introduce an invariant of motion and we characterize the peak of infection. We further examine the system under a threshold constraint on the infection level. Based on this analysis, we formulate an optimal control problem to keep the infection curve below a healthcare capacity threshold while minimizing the economic cost. For this problem, we study a feasible strategy that involves applying the minimal necessary restrictions to meet the capacity constraint and characterize the corresponding cost.</description>

      <title>Data-driven balanced truncation for linear systems with quadratic outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the framework for a non-intrusive, quadrature-based method for approximate balanced truncation (QuadBT) of linear systems with quadratic outputs, thus extending the applicability of QuadBT, which was originally designed for data-driven balanced truncation of standard linear systems with linear outputs only. The new approach makes use of the time-domain and frequency-domain quadrature-based representation of the system's infinite Gramians, only implicitly. We show that by sampling solely the extended impulse responses of the original system and their derivatives (or the corresponding transfer functions), we construct a reduced-order model that mimics the approximation quality of the intrusive (projection-based) balanced truncation. We validate the proposed framework on a numerical example.</description>

Abstract: We extend the concept of average expansivity for operators on Banach spaces to operators on arbitrary locally convex spaces. We obtain complete characterizations of the average expansive weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. Moreover, we give a partial answer to a problem proposed by Bernardes et al. in J. Funct. Anal. 288 (2025), Paper No. 110696, by obtaining complete characterizations of the uniformly expansive weighted shifts on K\"othe sequence spaces. Some general properties of the various concepts of expansivity in linear dynamics and several concrete examples are also presented.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincar\'e map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs high Earth orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of embedding and generalized synchronization in reservoir computing has recently been developed. Under ideal conditions, reservoir computing exhibits generalized synchronization during the learning process. These insights form a rigorous basis for understanding reservoir computing ability to reconstruct and predict complex dynamics. In this study, we clarified the dynamical system structures of generalized synchronization and embedding by comparing the Lyapunov exponents of a high dimensional neural network within the reservoir computing model with those in actual systems. Furthermore, we numerically calculated the Lyapunov exponents restricted to the tangent space of the inertial manifold in a high dimensional neural network. Our results demonstrate that all Lyapunov exponents of the actual dynamics, including negative ones, are successfully identified.</description>

      <title>Fast reconstruction of degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models from spike times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.</description>

      <title>On the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture in Characteristics $\ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short).
  $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.
  The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics.This leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $\ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their full determination.</description>

      <title>Density of thin film billiard reflection pseudogroup in Hamiltonian symplectomorphism pseudogroup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.02657v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reflections from hypersurfaces act by symplectomorphisms on the space of oriented lines with respect to the canonical symplectic form. We consider an arbitrary $C^{\infty}$-smooth hypersurface $\gamma\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$ that is either a global strictly convex closed hypersurface, or a germ of hypersurface. We deal with the pseudogroup generated by compositional ratios of reflections from $\gamma$ and of reflections from its small deformations. In the case, when $\gamma$ is a global convex hypersurface, we show that the latter pseudogroup is dense in the pseudogroup of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms between subdomains of the phase cylinder: the space of oriented lines intersecting $\gamma$ transversally. We prove an analogous local result in the case, when $\gamma$ is a germ. The derivatives of the above compositional differences in the deformation parameter are Hamiltonian vector fields calculated by Ron Perline. To prove the main results, we find the Lie algebra generated by them and prove its $C^{\infty}$-density in the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields. We also prove analogues of the above results for hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study open zooming systems and potentials with uniqueness of equilibrium states. The uniqueness is established for a certain class of zooming potentials when the map is topologically exact, including the null one. Also, with equilibrium stability, we prove that there exists a countable and an open sets of continuous potentials with uniqueness which are both dense in the set of continuous potentials with finiteness. The results here are related to the works [14] and [49] where finiteness and stability are studied.</description>

      <title>Emergence for diffeomorphisms with nonzero Lyapunov exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set of points with high pointwise emergence for $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphisms preserving a hyperbolic measure. We find a lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of this set in terms of unstable Hausdorff dimension of the hyperbolic measure. If the measure is an SRB, we prove that the set of points with high emergence has full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Topological vortex identification for two-dimensional turbulent flows in doubly periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics and statistical properties of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence are often investigated through numerical simulations of incompressible, viscous fluids in doubly periodic domains. A key challenge in 2D turbulence research is accurately identifying and describing statistical properties of its coherent vortex structures within complex flow patterns. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a classification theory for the topological structure of particle orbits generated by instantaneous Hamiltonian flows on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, which serves as a mathematical model for 2D incompressible flows. Based on this theory, we show that the global orbit structure of any Hamiltonian flow can be converted into a planar tree, named a partially Cyclically-Ordered rooted Tree (COT), and its corresponding string expression (COT representation). We apply this conversion algorithm to 2D energy and enstrophy cascade turbulence. The results show that the complex topological structure of turbulent flow patterns can be effectively represented by simple trees and sequences of letters, thereby successfully extracting coherent vortex structures and investigating their statistical properties from a topological perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a continuous linear cocycle over an expanding base dynamics for which the Lyapunov exponents of all ergodic invariant probability measures are small, except for one measure whose Lyapunov exponents are away from zero. The support of this distinguished measure is not a periodic orbit. In particular, our example violates the periodic approximation property.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Behavior of Linear Nonautonomous Advanced and Delayed Impulsive Differential Equations with Discontinuous Deviating Arguments via Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new sufficient conditions for the oscillatory and non-oscillatory behavior of solutions to nonautonomous advanced and delayed linear differential equations with piecewise constant arguments: $$x'(t) = a(t)x(t) + b(t)x([t-k]), \quad k \in \mathbb{Z},$$ in both impulsive and non-impulsive cases (DEPCA and IDEPCA, respectively). The results rely on classical oscillation criteria for difference equations and exploit the hybrid nature of these equations, connecting them to the theory of advanced and delayed difference equations.</description>

      <title>Technical Developments of DA on $\mathbb{T}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed a DA on $\mathbb{T}^3$, which complements the work of Gan, Li, Viana, and Yang (\cite{GanLiVianaYang2021}) by providing an example of a $C^\infty$-diffeomorphism with partial volume expansion, where $\dim(E^{cs}) = 2$. In contrast to their work, in \cite{GanLiVianaYang2021}, they provided an example of a non-invertible embedding in the case $\dim(E^{cs}) = 2$. The inverse map of the DA we constructed has a mostly expanding center (\cite{AnderssonVasquez2018}). Using a similar approach, we can also construct a (nontrivial) mixed center (\cite{MiCaoYang2017, MiCao2021}).</description>

      <title>A piecewise linear homeomorphism of the circle which is periodic under renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a piecewise linear homeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which maps rationals to rationals, whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$, and whose rotation number is $\sqrt{2}-1$. This is achieved by showing that a renormalization procedure becomes periodic when applied to $f$. Our construction gives a negative answer to a question of D. Calegari. When combined with work of the 2nd and 3rd authors, our result also shows that $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ does not embed into $F$, where $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the subgroup of the Stein-Thompson group $F_{2,3}$ consisting of those elements whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$. Finally, we produce some evidence suggesting a positive answer to a variation of Calegari's question and record a number of computational observations.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the orthogeodesic foliation and ergodic theory of the earthquake flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, the authors extended Mirzakhani's (almost-everywhere defined) measurable conjugacy between the earthquake and horocycle flows to a measurable bijection. In this one, we analyze the continuity properties of this map and its inverse, proving that both are continuous at many points and in many directions. This lets us transfer measure convergence between the two systems, allowing us to pull back results from Teichm{\"u}ller dynamics to deduce analogous statements for the earthquake flow.</description>

      <title>Sliding motions on systems with non-Euclidean state spaces: A differential-geometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends sliding-mode control theory to nonlinear systems evolving on smooth manifolds. Building on differential geometric methods, we reformulate Filippov's notion of solutions, characterize well-defined vector fields on quotient spaces, and provide a consistent geometric definition of higher-order sliding modes. We generalize the regular form to non-Euclidean settings and design explicit first- and second-order sliding-mode controllers that respect the manifold structure. Particular attention is given to the role of topological obstructions, which are illustrated through examples on the cylinder, M\"obius bundle, and 2-sphere. Our results highlight how geometric and topological properties fundamentally influence sliding dynamics and suggest new directions for robust control in nonlinear spaces.</description>
