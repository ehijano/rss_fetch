      <title>Cavity Spectroscopy for Strongly Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as an intriguing perspective for controlling quantum materials, but a key challenge lies in measuring properties of the embedded matter. Here, we propose a framework for probing strongly correlated cavity-embedded materials through direct measurements of cavity photons. We derive general relations between photon and matter observables inside the cavity, and show how these can be measured via the emitted photons. As an example, we demonstrate how the entanglement phase transition of an embedded H$_2$ molecule can be accessed by measuring the cavity photon occupation, and showcase how dynamical spin correlation functions can be accessed by measuring dynamical photon correlation functions. Our framework provides an all-optical method to measure static and dynamic properties of cavity-embedded materials.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Spin-Light Coupling in Proximitized Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) materials are highly susceptible to the influence of their neighbors, thereby enabling the design by proximity phenomena. We reveal a remarkable terahertz (THz) spin-light interaction in 2D Dirac materials that arises from magnetic and spin-orbital proximity effects. The dynamical realization of the spin-charge conversion, the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), of Dirac electrons displays distinctive THz features, upon emerging spin-pseudospin proximity terms in the Hamiltonian. To capture the effect of fast pseudospin dynamics on the electron spin, we develop a mean-field theory and complement it with a quantum-mechanical treatment. As a specific example, we investigate the THz response of a single graphene layer proximitized by a magnetic substrate. Our analysis demonstrates a strong enhancement and anomalous polarization structure of the THz-light absorption which can enable THz detection and efficient generation and control of spins in spin-based quantum devices. The identified coupled spin-pseudospin dynamics is not limited to EDSR and may influence a broad range of optical, transport, and ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Long-Range Interactions in Mesoscopic Ising Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the design of magnetic ordering in one-dimensional mesoscopic magnetic Ising chains by modulating long-range interactions. These interactions are affected by geometrical modifications to the chain, which adjust the energy hierarchy and the resulting magnetic ground states. Consequently, the magnetic ordering can be tuned between antiferromagnetic and dimer antiferromagnetic phases. These phases are experimentally observed in chains fabricated using both conventional electron-beam lithography and ion implantation techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling magnetic properties at the mesoscale. The ability of attaining these magnetic structures by thermal annealing, underlines the potential of using such systems instead of simulated annealers in tackling combinatorial optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Competition of vortex core structures in superfluid $^3$He-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among vortex structures identified so far in superfluid $^3$He-B, the most common are the A-phase-core vortex and the double-core vortex. According to earlier numerical calculations, the double-core vortex is energetically favored nearly everywhere in the $p$-$T$ phase diagram. Nevertheless, in experiments the A-phase-core vortex has been observed down to temperatures of $0.6T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at high pressures. We use the Ginzburg-Landau formalism to calculate the energies of the two vortex structures in the experimentally relevant magnetic field as well as the energy barrier for the transition between the two structures. Assigning vanishing barrier as the boundary of the metastability region of the A-phase-core vortex, we reproduce the experimentally measured vortex phase diagram and provide an explanation for the reappearance of the double-core vortex near the critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at low pressures: The difference in Zeeman energy between the two vortex structures becomes relatively more important close to $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, and the A-phase-core vortex becomes unstable. In contrast to the equilibrium vortex structures, we suggest that the vortex nucleation process favors the A-phase-core vortex over the double-core vortex. Our approach can be used to analyze competition between different vortex structures in other unconventional superfluids and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Dynamics in Helium Ion Injection onto Tungsten Surfaces Based on Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>

      <title>Commensurate Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations with Small Electron Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities of a square lattice. The inclusion of both first and second neighbour hopping terms, along with exchange coupling, induces anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations over a finite range of fillings in both longitudinal and transversal static spin susceptibilities. In the absence of on-site Hubbard interaction, we observe incommensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations between the two Van Hove fillings. Beyond the second Van Hove singularity at $ n=1.03 $, commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations dominate in both longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities. When incorporating a finite Hubbard interaction strength, $ U $, we find that the commensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations are preserved in both longitudinal and transversal dressed spin susceptibilities. However anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations vanish beyond a critical value of the Hubbard coupling strength, $ U_{c} $. Despite the exchange field can be induced by a ferromagnetic substrate, we do not observe any ferromagnetic fluctuations in the system.</description>
