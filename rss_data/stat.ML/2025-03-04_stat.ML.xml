      <title>An interpretation of the Brownian bridge as a physics-informed prior for the Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning is one of the most commonly used methods for fusing physical knowledge in the form of partial differential equations with experimental data. The idea is to construct a loss function where the physical laws take the place of a regularizer and minimize it to reconstruct the underlying physical fields and any missing parameters. However, there is a noticeable lack of a direct connection between physics-informed loss functions and an overarching Bayesian framework. In this work, we demonstrate that Brownian bridge Gaussian processes can be viewed as a softly-enforced physics-constrained prior for the Poisson equation. We first show equivalence between the variational form of the physics-informed loss function for the Poisson equation and a kernel ridge regression objective. Then, through the connection between Gaussian process regression and kernel methods, we identify a Gaussian process for which the posterior mean function and physics-informed loss function minimizer agree. This connection allows us to probe different theoretical questions, such as convergence and behavior of inverse problems. We also connect the method to the important problem of identifying model-form error in applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Information in Interactive Decision Making: A Case Study for Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of information in interactive decision making through the lens of a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Focusing on a fundamental example where a unique optimal arm outperforms the rest by a fixed margin, we characterize the optimal success probability and mutual information over time. Our findings reveal distinct growth phases in mutual information -- initially linear, transitioning to quadratic, and finally returning to linear -- highlighting curious behavioral differences between interactive and non-interactive environments. In particular, we show that optimal success probability and mutual information can be decoupled, where achieving optimal learning does not necessarily require maximizing information gain. These findings shed new light on the intricate interplay between information and learning in interactive decision making.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds for Equivariant Networks on Markov Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks play a pivotal role in analyzing datasets with symmetry properties, particularly in complex data structures. However, integrating equivariance with Markov properties presents notable challenges due to the inherent dependencies within such data. Previous research has primarily concentrated on establishing generalization bounds under the assumption of independently and identically distributed data, frequently neglecting the influence of Markov dependencies. In this study, we investigate the impact of Markov properties on generalization performance alongside the role of equivariance within this context. We begin by applying a new McDiarmid's inequality to derive a generalization bound for neural networks trained on Markov datasets, using Rademacher complexity as a central measure of model capacity. Subsequently, we utilize group theory to compute the covering number under equivariant constraints, enabling us to obtain an upper bound on the Rademacher complexity based on this covering number. This bound provides practical insights into selecting low-dimensional irreducible representations, enhancing generalization performance for fixed-width equivariant neural networks.</description>

      <title>LNUCB-TA: Linear-nonlinear Hybrid Bandit Learning with Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms fail to effectively capture both long-term trends and local patterns across all arms, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with rapidly changing reward structures. They also rely on static exploration rates, which do not dynamically adjust to changing conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LNUCB-TA, a hybrid bandit model integrating a novel nonlinear component (adaptive k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) for reducing time complexity, alongside a global-and-local attention-based exploration mechanism. Our approach uniquely combines linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, with the nonlinear module dynamically adjusting k based on reward variance to enhance spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This reduces the likelihood of selecting suboptimal arms while improving reward estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. The attention-based mechanism ranks arms by past performance and selection frequency, dynamically adjusting exploration and exploitation in real time without requiring manual tuning of exploration rates. By integrating global attention (assessing all arms collectively) and local attention (focusing on individual arms), LNUCB-TA efficiently adapts to temporal and spatial complexities. Empirical results show LNUCB-TA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art linear, nonlinear, and hybrid bandits in cumulative and mean reward, convergence, and robustness across different exploration rates. Theoretical analysis further confirms its reliability with a sub-linear regret bound.</description>

      <title>On the Saturation Effects of Spectral Algorithms in Large Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturation effects, which originally refer to the fact that kernel ridge regression (KRR) fails to achieve the information-theoretical lower bound when the regression function is over-smooth, have been observed for almost 20 years and were rigorously proved recently for kernel ridge regression and some other spectral algorithms over a fixed dimensional domain. The main focus of this paper is to explore the saturation effects for a large class of spectral algorithms (including the KRR, gradient descent, etc.) in large dimensional settings where $n \asymp d^{\gamma}$. More precisely, we first propose an improved minimax lower bound for the kernel regression problem in large dimensional settings and show that the gradient flow with early stopping strategy will result in an estimator achieving this lower bound (up to a logarithmic factor). Similar to the results in KRR, we can further determine the exact convergence rates (both upper and lower bounds) of a large class of (optimal tuned) spectral algorithms with different qualification $\tau$'s. In particular, we find that these exact rate curves (varying along $\gamma$) exhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the polynomial approximation barrier. Consequently, we can fully depict the saturation effects of the spectral algorithms and reveal a new phenomenon in large dimensional settings (i.e., the saturation effect occurs in large dimensional setting as long as the source condition $s&gt;\tau$ while it occurs in fixed dimensional setting as long as $s&gt;2\tau$).</description>

      <title>Trajectory Inference with Smooth Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in trajectory inference and particle tracking, we introduce Smooth Schr\"odinger Bridges. Our proposal generalizes prior work by allowing the reference process in the Schr\"odinger Bridge problem to be a smooth Gaussian process, leading to more regular and interpretable trajectories in applications. Though na\"ively smoothing the reference process leads to a computationally intractable problem, we identify a class of processes (including the Mat\'ern processes) for which the resulting Smooth Schr\"odinger Bridge problem can be lifted to a simpler problem on phase space, which can be solved in polynomial time. We develop a practical approximation of this algorithm that outperforms existing methods on numerous simulated and real single-cell RNAseq datasets.

      <title>Semi-Parametric Batched Global Multi-Armed Bandits with Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework is a widely used approach for sequential decision-making, where a decision-maker selects an arm in each round with the goal of maximizing long-term rewards. Moreover, in many practical applications, such as personalized medicine and recommendation systems, feedback is provided in batches, contextual information is available at the time of decision-making, and rewards from different arms are related rather than independent. We propose a novel semi-parametric framework for batched bandits with covariates and a shared parameter across arms, leveraging the single-index regression (SIR) model to capture relationships between arm rewards while balancing interpretability and flexibility. Our algorithm, Batched single-Index Dynamic binning and Successive arm elimination (BIDS), employs a batched successive arm elimination strategy with a dynamic binning mechanism guided by the single-index direction. We consider two settings: one where a pilot direction is available and another where the direction is estimated from data, deriving theoretical regret bounds for both cases. When a pilot direction is available with sufficient accuracy, our approach achieves minimax-optimal rates (with $d = 1$) for nonparametric batched bandits, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to the nonparametric batched bandit method introduced by \cite{jiang2024batched}.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theory of Eigenvectors for Latent Embeddings with Generalized Laplacian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laplacian matrices are commonly employed in many real applications, encoding the underlying latent structural information such as graphs and manifolds. The use of the normalization terms naturally gives rise to random matrices with dependency. It is well-known that dependency is a major bottleneck of new random matrix theory (RMT) developments. To this end, in this paper, we formally introduce a class of generalized (and regularized) Laplacian matrices, which contains the Laplacian matrix and the random adjacency matrix as a specific case, and suggest the new framework of the asymptotic theory of eigenvectors for latent embeddings with generalized Laplacian matrices (ATE-GL). Our new theory is empowered by the tool of generalized quadratic vector equation for dealing with RMT under dependency, and delicate high-order asymptotic expansions of the empirical spiked eigenvectors and eigenvalues based on local laws. The asymptotic normalities established for both spiked eigenvectors and eigenvalues will enable us to conduct precise inference and uncertainty quantification for applications involving the generalized Laplacian matrices with flexibility. We discuss some applications of the suggested ATE-GL framework and showcase its validity through some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Two-Layer Neural Networks after One Gradient Step under Gaussian Mixtures Data with Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the training and generalization performance of two-layer neural networks (NNs) after one gradient descent step under structured data modeled by Gaussian mixtures. While previous research has extensively analyzed this model under isotropic data assumption, such simplifications overlook the complexities inherent in real-world datasets. Our work addresses this limitation by analyzing two-layer NNs under Gaussian mixture data assumption in the asymptotically proportional limit, where the input dimension, number of hidden neurons, and sample size grow with finite ratios. We characterize the training and generalization errors by leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian universality. Specifically, we prove that a high-order polynomial model performs equivalent to the nonlinear neural networks under certain conditions. The degree of the equivalent model is intricately linked to both the "data spread" and the learning rate employed during one gradient step. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the equivalence between the original model and its polynomial counterpart across various regression and classification tasks. Additionally, we explore how different properties of Gaussian mixtures affect learning outcomes. Finally, we illustrate experimental results on Fashion-MNIST classification, indicating that our findings can translate to realistic data.</description>

      <title>PABBO: Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) is a sample-efficient method to learn latent user utilities from preferential feedback over a pair of designs. It relies on a statistical surrogate model for the latent function, usually a Gaussian process, and an acquisition strategy to select the next candidate pair to get user feedback on. Due to the non-conjugacy of the associated likelihood, every PBO step requires a significant amount of computations with various approximate inference techniques. This computational overhead is incompatible with the way humans interact with computers, hindering the use of PBO in real-world cases. Building on the recent advances of amortized BO, we propose to circumvent this issue by fully amortizing PBO, meta-learning both the surrogate and the acquisition function. Our method comprises a novel transformer neural process architecture, trained using reinforcement learning and tailored auxiliary losses. On a benchmark composed of synthetic and real-world datasets, our method is several orders of magnitude faster than the usual Gaussian process-based strategies and often outperforms them in accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel kernel-based framework for learning differential equations and their solution maps that is efficient in data requirements, in terms of solution examples and amount of measurements from each example, and computational cost, in terms of training procedures. Our approach is mathematically interpretable and backed by rigorous theoretical guarantees in the form of quantitative worst-case error bounds for the learned equation. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in computational complexity and robustness while achieving one to two orders of magnitude improvements in terms of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Vector Copula Variational Inference and Dependent Block Posterior Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular method to estimate statistical and econometric models. The key to VI is the selection of a tractable density to approximate the Bayesian posterior. For large and complex models a common choice is to assume independence between multivariate blocks in a partition of the parameter space. While this simplifies the problem it can reduce accuracy. This paper proposes using vector copulas to capture dependence between the blocks parsimoniously. Tailored multivariate marginals are constructed using learnable cyclically monotone transformations. We call the resulting joint distribution a ``dependent block posterior'' approximation. Vector copula models are suggested that make tractable and flexible variational approximations. They allow for differing marginals, numbers of blocks, block sizes and forms of between block dependence. They also allow for solution of the variational optimization using fast and efficient stochastic gradient methods. The efficacy and versatility of the approach is demonstrated using four different statistical models and 16 datasets which have posteriors that are challenging to approximate. In all cases, our method produces more accurate posterior approximations than benchmark VI methods that either assume block independence or factor-based dependence, at limited additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Structured Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a ubiquitous modeling framework that finds applications in physics, biology, engineering, social science, and finance. Due to the availability of large-scale data sets, there is growing interest in learning mechanistic models from observations with stochastic noise. In this work, we present a nonparametric framework to learn both the drift and diffusion terms in systems of SDEs where the stochastic noise is singular. Specifically, inspired by second-order equations from classical physics, we consider systems which possess structured noise, i.e. noise with a singular covariance matrix. We provide an algorithm for constructing estimators given trajectory data and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods via a number of examples from physics and biology. As the developed framework is most naturally applicable to systems possessing a high degree of dimensionality reduction (i.e. symmetry), we also apply it to the high dimensional Cucker-Smale flocking model studied in collective dynamics and show that it is able to accurately infer the low dimensional interaction kernel from particle data.</description>

      <title>Improving the statistical efficiency of cross-conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vovk (2015) introduced cross-conformal prediction, a modification of split conformal designed to improve the width of prediction sets. The method, when trained with a miscoverage rate equal to $\alpha$ and $n \gg K$, ensures a marginal coverage of at least $1 - 2\alpha - 2(1-\alpha)(K-1)/(n+K)$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $K$ denotes the number of folds. A simple modification of the method achieves coverage of at least $1-2\alpha$. In this work, we propose new variants of both methods that yield smaller prediction sets without compromising the latter theoretical guarantee. The proposed methods are based on recent results deriving more statistically efficient combination of p-values that leverage exchangeability and randomization. Simulations confirm the theoretical findings and bring out some important tradeoffs.</description>

Building on earlier work of He, Lee, and Oliver, we show that a feed-forward neural network classifier trained on subsets of the invariants arising in the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjectural formula yields higher accuracies ($&gt; 0.9$) than any model previously studied. In addition, we develop a regression model that may be used to predict orders of this group not seen during training and apply this to the elliptic curve of rank 29 recently discovered by Elkies and Klagsbrun. Finally we conduct some exploratory data analyses and visualizations on our dataset. We use the elliptic curve dataset from the L-functions and modular forms database (LMFDB).</description>

      <title>DISCO: Internal Evaluation of Density-Based Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In density-based clustering, clusters are areas of high object density separated by lower object density areas. This notion supports arbitrarily shaped clusters and automatic detection of noise points that do not belong to any cluster. However, it is challenging to adequately evaluate the quality of density-based clustering results. Even though some existing cluster validity indices (CVIs) target arbitrarily shaped clusters, none of them captures the quality of the labeled noise. In this paper, we propose DISCO, a Density-based Internal Score for Clustering Outcomes, which is the first CVI that also evaluates the quality of noise labels. DISCO reliably evaluates density-based clusters of arbitrary shape by assessing compactness and separation. It also introduces a direct assessment of noise labels for any given clustering. Our experiments show that DISCO evaluates density-based clusterings more consistently than its competitors. It is additionally the first method to evaluate the complete labeling of density-based clustering methods, including noise labels.</description>

      <title>Conformal Risk Control for Semantic Uncertainty Quantification in Computed Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is necessary for developers, physicians, and regulatory agencies to build trust in machine learning predictors and improve patient care. Beyond measuring uncertainty, it is crucial to express it in clinically meaningful terms that provide actionable insights. This work introduces a conformal risk control (CRC) procedure for organ-dependent uncertainty estimation, ensuring high-probability coverage of the ground-truth image. We first present a high-dimensional CRC procedure that leverages recent ideas of length minimization. We make this procedure semantically adaptive to each patient's anatomy and positioning of organs. Our method, sem-CRC, provides tighter uncertainty intervals with valid coverage on real-world computed tomography (CT) data while communicating uncertainty with clinically relevant features.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Harm of Gradient Attacks While Only Flipping Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Availability attacks are one of the strongest forms of training-phase attacks in machine learning, making the model unusable. While prior work in distributed ML has demonstrated such effect via gradient attacks and, more recently, data poisoning, we ask: can similar damage be inflicted solely by flipping training labels, without altering features? In this work, we introduce a novel formalization of label flipping attacks and derive an attacker-optimized loss function that better illustrates label flipping capabilities. To compare the damaging effect of label flipping with that of gradient attacks, we use a setting that allows us to compare their \emph{writing power} on the ML model. Our contribution is threefold, (1) we provide the first evidence for an availability attack through label flipping alone, (2) we shed light on an interesting interplay between what the attacker gains from more \emph{write access} versus what they gain from more \emph{flipping budget} and (3) we compare the power of targeted label flipping attack to that of an untargeted label flipping attack.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Learning for Missing Not-at-Random Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study transfer learning for matrix completion in a Missing Not-at-Random (MNAR) setting that is motivated by biological problems. The target matrix $Q$ has entire rows and columns missing, making estimation impossible without side information. To address this, we use a noisy and incomplete source matrix $P$, which relates to $Q$ via a feature shift in latent space. We consider both the active and passive sampling of rows and columns. We establish minimax lower bounds for entrywise estimation error in each setting. Our computationally efficient estimation framework achieves this lower bound for the active setting, which leverages the source data to query the most informative rows and columns of $Q$. This avoids the need for incoherence assumptions required for rate optimality in the passive sampling setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comparisons with existing algorithms on real-world biological datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying First-Order Markov Violations in Noisy Reinforcement Learning: A Causal Discovery Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) methods frequently assume that each new observation completely reflects the environment's state, thereby guaranteeing Markovian (one-step) transitions. In practice, partial observability or sensor/actuator noise often invalidates this assumption. This paper proposes a systematic methodology for detecting such violations, combining a partial correlation-based causal discovery process (PCMCI) with a novel Markov Violation score (MVS). The MVS measures multi-step dependencies that emerge when noise or incomplete state information disrupts the Markov property.
  Classic control tasks (CartPole, Pendulum, Acrobot) serve as examples to illustrate how targeted noise and dimension omissions affect both RL performance and measured Markov consistency. Surprisingly, even substantial observation noise sometimes fails to induce strong multi-lag dependencies in certain domains (e.g., Acrobot). In contrast, dimension-dropping investigations show that excluding some state variables (e.g., angular velocities in CartPole and Pendulum) significantly reduces returns and increases MVS, while removing other dimensions has minimal impact.
  These findings emphasize the importance of locating and safeguarding the most causally essential dimensions in order to preserve effective single-step learning. By integrating partial correlation tests with RL performance outcomes, the proposed approach precisely identifies when and where the Markov assumption is violated. This framework offers a principled mechanism for developing robust policies, informing representation learning, and addressing partial observability in real-world RL scenarios. All code and experimental logs are accessible for reproducibility (https://github.com/ucsb/markovianess).</description>

      <title>Armijo Line-search Makes (Stochastic) Gradient Descent Go Fast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Armijo line-search (Armijo-LS) is a standard method to set the step-size for gradient descent (GD). For smooth functions, Armijo-LS alleviates the need to know the global smoothness constant $L$ and adapts to the local smoothness, enabling GD to converge faster. However, existing theoretical analyses of GD with Armijo-LS (GD-LS) do not characterize this fast convergence. We show that if the objective function satisfies a certain non-uniform smoothness condition, GD-LS converges provably faster than GD with a constant $1/L$ step-size (denoted as GD(1/L)). Our results imply that for convex losses corresponding to logistic regression and multi-class classification, GD-LS can converge to the optimum at a linear rate and, hence, improve over the sublinear convergence of GD(1/L). Furthermore, for non-convex losses satisfying gradient domination (for example, those corresponding to the softmax policy gradient in RL or generalized linear models with a logistic link function), GD-LS can match the fast convergence of algorithms tailored for these specific settings. Finally, we prove that under the interpolation assumption, for convex losses, stochastic GD with a stochastic line-search can match the fast convergence of GD-LS.</description>

      <title>1-Lipschitz Network Initialization for Certifiably Robust Classification Applications: A Decay Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the weight parametrization of two standard 1-Lipschitz network structure methodologies, the Almost-Orthogonal-Layers (AOL) and the SDP-based Lipschitz Layers (SLL), and derives their impact on the initialization for deep 1-Lipschitz feedforward networks in addition to discussing underlying issues surrounding this initialization. These networks are mainly used in certifiably robust classification applications to combat adversarial attacks by limiting the effects of perturbations on the output classification result. An exact and an upper bound for the parameterized weight variance was calculated assuming a standard Normal distribution initialization; additionally, an upper bound was computed assuming a Generalized Normal Distribution, generalizing the proof for Uniform, Laplace, and Normal distribution weight initializations. It is demonstrated that the weight variance holds no bearing on the output variance distribution and that only the dimension of the weight matrices matters. Additionally, this paper demonstrates that the weight initialization always causes deep 1-Lipschitz networks to decay to zero.</description>

      <title>Hidden Convexity of Fair PCA and Fast Solver via Eigenvalue Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a foundational technique in machine learning for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional datasets. However, PCA could lead to biased outcomes that disadvantage certain subgroups of the underlying datasets. To address the bias issue, a Fair PCA (FPCA) model was introduced by Samadi et al. (2018) for equalizing the reconstruction loss between subgroups. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based approach proposed by Samadi et al. (2018) is computationally expensive even for suboptimal solutions. To improve efficiency, several alternative variants of the FPCA model have been developed. These variants often shift the focus away from equalizing the reconstruction loss. In this paper, we identify a hidden convexity in the FPCA model and introduce an algorithm for convex optimization via eigenvalue optimization. Our approach achieves the desired fairness in reconstruction loss without sacrificing performance. As demonstrated in real-world datasets, the proposed FPCA algorithm runs $8\times$ faster than the SDR-based algorithm, and only at most 85% slower than the standard PCA.</description>

      <title>Cauchy Random Features for Operator Learning in Sobolev Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning is the approximation of operators between infinite dimensional Banach spaces using machine learning approaches. While most progress in this area has been driven by variants of deep neural networks such as the Deep Operator Network and Fourier Neural Operator, the theoretical guarantees are often in the form of a universal approximation property. However, the existence theorems do not guarantee that an accurate operator network is obtainable in practice. Motivated by the recent kernel-based operator learning framework, we propose a random feature operator learning method with theoretical guarantees and error bounds. The random feature method can be viewed as a randomized approximation of a kernel method, which significantly reduces the computation requirements for training. We provide a generalization error analysis for our proposed random feature operator learning method along with comprehensive numerical results. Compared to kernel-based method and neural network methods, the proposed method can obtain similar or better test errors across benchmarks examples with significantly reduced training times. An additional advantages it that our implementation is simple and does require costly computational resources, such as GPU.</description>

      <title>Remasking Discrete Diffusion Models with Inference-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Part of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when a token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, a method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in a principled way and that is derived from a discrete diffusion model with a custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with a form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion. We provide the code along with a blog post on the project page: https://remdm.github.io.</description>

      <title>Learning Conditional Average Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BART (Bayesian additive regression trees) has been established as a leading supervised learning method, particularly in the field of causal inference. This paper explores the use of BART models for learning conditional average treatment effects (CATE) from regression discontinuity designs, where treatment assignment is based on whether an observed covariate (called the running variable) exceeds a pre-specified threshold. A purpose-built version of BART that uses linear regression leaf models (of the running variable and treatment assignment dummy) is shown to out-perform off-the-shelf BART implementations as well as a local polynomial regression approach and a CART-based approach. The new method is evaluated in thorough simulation studies as well as an empirical application looking at the effect of academic probation on student performance.</description>

      <title>MCNet: Monotonic Calibration Networks for Expressive Uncertainty Calibration in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online advertising, uncertainty calibration aims to adjust a ranking model's probability predictions to better approximate the true likelihood of an event, e.g., a click or a conversion. However, existing calibration approaches may lack the ability to effectively model complex nonlinear relations, consider context features, and achieve balanced performance across different data subsets. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel model called Monotonic Calibration Networks, featuring three key designs: a monotonic calibration function (MCF), an order-preserving regularizer, and a field-balance regularizer. The nonlinear MCF is capable of naturally modeling and universally approximating the intricate relations between uncalibrated predictions and the posterior probabilities, thus being much more expressive than existing methods. MCF can also integrate context features using a flexible model architecture, thereby achieving context awareness. The order-preserving and field-balance regularizers promote the monotonic relationship between adjacent bins and the balanced calibration performance on data subsets, respectively. Experimental results on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in generating well-calibrated probability predictions.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews statistical methods for hypothesis testing and clustering in network models. We analyze the method by Bickel et al. (2016) for deriving the asymptotic null distribution of the largest eigenvalue, noting its slow convergence and the need for bootstrap corrections. The SCORE method by Jin et al. (2015) and the NCV method by Chen et al. (2018) are evaluated for their efficacy in clustering within Degree-Corrected Block Models, with NCV facing challenges due to its time-intensive nature. We suggest exploring eigenvector entry distributions as a potential efficiency improvement.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights in Model Inversion Robustness and Conditional Entropy Maximization for Collaborative Inference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By locally encoding raw data into intermediate features, collaborative inference enables end users to leverage powerful deep learning models without exposure of sensitive raw data to cloud servers. However, recent studies have revealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve privacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via model inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise corruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters, enhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy empirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive, and the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and inversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that, this work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs given intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the reconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA. Then, we derive a differentiable and solvable measure for bounding this conditional entropy based on the Gaussian mixture estimation and propose a conditional entropy maximization (CEM) algorithm to enhance the inversion robustness. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed CEM; without compromising feature utility and computing efficiency, plugging the proposed CEM into obfuscation-based defense mechanisms consistently boosts their inversion robustness, achieving average gains ranging from 12.9\% to 48.2\%.

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Linear Bandits: Huber Regression with One-Pass Update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed noise. Two principled strategies for handling heavy-tailed noise, truncation and median-of-means, have been introduced to heavy-tailed bandits. Nonetheless, these methods rely on specific noise assumptions or bandit structures, limiting their applicability to general settings. The recent work [Huang et al.2024] develops a soft truncation method via the adaptive Huber regression to address these limitations. However, their method suffers undesired computational cost: it requires storing all historical data and performing a full pass over these data at each round. In this paper, we propose a \emph{one-pass} algorithm based on the online mirror descent framework. Our method updates using only current data at each round, reducing the per-round computational cost from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t \log T)$ to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ with respect to current round $t$ and the time horizon $T$, and achieves a near-optimal and variance-aware regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d T^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T \nu_t^2} + d T^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}\big)$ where $d$ is the dimension and $\nu_t^{1+\epsilon}$ is the $(1+\epsilon)$-th central moment of reward at round $t$.</description>

      <title>Functional multi-armed bandit and the best function identification problems</title>

Abstract: Bandit optimization usually refers to the class of online optimization problems with limited feedback, namely, a decision maker uses only the objective value at the current point to make a new decision and does not have access to the gradient of the objective function. While this name accurately captures the limitation in feedback, it is somehow misleading since it does not have any connection with the multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem class. We propose two new classes of problems: the functional multi-armed bandit problem (FMAB) and the best function identification problem. They are modifications of a multi-armed bandit problem and the best arm identification problem, respectively, where each arm represents an unknown black-box function. These problem classes are a surprisingly good fit for modeling real-world problems such as competitive LLM training. To solve the problems from these classes, we propose a new reduction scheme to construct UCB-type algorithms, namely, the F-LCB algorithm, based on algorithms for nonlinear optimization with known convergence rates. We provide the regret upper bounds for this reduction scheme based on the base algorithms' convergence rates. We add numerical experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>End-To-End Learning of Gaussian Mixture Priors for Diffusion Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models optimized via variational inference (VI) have emerged as a promising tool for generating samples from unnormalized target densities. These models create samples by simulating a stochastic differential equation, starting from a simple, tractable prior, typically a Gaussian distribution. However, when the support of this prior differs greatly from that of the target distribution, diffusion models often struggle to explore effectively or suffer from large discretization errors. Moreover, learning the prior distribution can lead to mode-collapse, exacerbated by the mode-seeking nature of reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in VI. To address these challenges, we propose end-to-end learnable Gaussian mixture priors (GMPs). GMPs offer improved control over exploration, adaptability to target support, and increased expressiveness to counteract mode collapse. We further leverage the structure of mixture models by proposing a strategy to iteratively refine the model by adding mixture components during training. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across a diverse range of real-world and synthetic benchmark problems when using GMPs without requiring additional target evaluations.</description>

      <title>The Uncertainty of Machine Learning Predictions in Asset Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning in asset pricing typically predicts expected returns as point estimates, ignoring uncertainty. We develop new methods to construct forecast confidence intervals for expected returns obtained from neural networks. We show that neural network forecasts of expected returns share the same asymptotic distribution as classic nonparametric methods, enabling a closed-form expression for their standard errors. We also propose a computationally feasible bootstrap to obtain the asymptotic distribution. We incorporate these forecast confidence intervals into an uncertainty-averse investment framework. This provides an economic rationale for shrinkage implementations of portfolio selection. Empirically, our methods improve out-of-sample performance.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Device Scheduling for Federated Learning Using Lyapunov Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a useful tool that enables the training of machine learning models over distributed data without having to collect data centrally. When deploying FL in constrained wireless environments, however, intermittent connectivity of devices, heterogeneous connection quality, and non-i.i.d. data can severely slow convergence. In this paper, we consider FL with arbitrary device participation probabilities for each round and show that by weighing each device's update by the reciprocal of their per-round participation probability, we can guarantee convergence to a stationary point. Our bound applies to non-convex loss functions and non-i.i.d. datasets and recovers state-of-the-art convergence rates for both full and uniform partial participation, including linear speedup, with only a single-sided learning rate. Then, using the derived convergence bound, we develop a new online client selection and power allocation algorithm that utilizes the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to opportunistically minimize a function of the convergence bound and the average communication time under a transmit power constraint. We use optimization over manifold techniques to obtain a solution to the minimization problem. Thanks to the Lyapunov framework, one key feature of the algorithm is that knowledge of the channel distribution is not required and only the instantaneous channel state information needs to be known. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset with varying levels of data heterogeneity, we show through simulations that the communication time can be significantly decreased using our algorithm compared to uniformly random participation, especially for heterogeneous channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Synergy Between Sufficient Changes and Sparse Mixing Procedure for Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to uncover latent variables underlying the observed data, and generally speaking, rather strong assumptions are needed to ensure identifiability. Some approaches rely on sufficient changes on the distribution of latent variables indicated by auxiliary variables such as domain indices, but acquiring enough domains is often challenging. Alternative approaches exploit structural sparsity assumptions on the mixing procedure, but such constraints are usually (partially) violated in practice. Interestingly, we find that these two seemingly unrelated assumptions can actually complement each other to achieve identifiability. Specifically, when conditioned on auxiliary variables, the sparse mixing procedure assumption provides structural constraints on the mapping from estimated to true latent variables and hence compensates for potentially insufficient distribution changes. Building on this insight, we propose an identifiability theory with less restrictive constraints regarding distribution changes and the sparse mixing procedure, enhancing applicability to real-world scenarios. Additionally, we develop an estimation framework incorporating a domain encoding network and a sparse mixing constraint and provide two implementations based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic and real-world datasets support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Parameter Expanded Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a promising framework for modeling predictive uncertainty and enhancing out-of-distribution robustness (OOD) by estimating the posterior distribution of network parameters. Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) is one of the most powerful methods for scalable posterior sampling in BNNs, achieving efficiency by combining stochastic gradient descent with second-order Langevin dynamics. However, SGMCMC often suffers from limited sample diversity in practice, which affects uncertainty estimation and model performance. We propose a simple yet effective approach to enhance sample diversity in SGMCMC without the need for tempering or running multiple chains. Our approach reparameterizes the neural network by decomposing each of its weight matrices into a product of matrices, resulting in a sampling trajectory that better explores the target parameter space. This approach produces a more diverse set of samples, allowing faster mixing within the same computational budget. Notably, our sampler achieves these improvements without increasing the inference cost compared to the standard SGMCMC. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks, including OOD robustness, diversity, loss surface analyses, and a comparative study with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Quasi-Optimism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our quest for a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that is both practical and provably optimal, we introduce EQO (Exploration via Quasi-Optimism). Unlike existing minimax optimal approaches, EQO avoids reliance on empirical variances and employs a simple bonus term proportional to the inverse of the state-action visit count. Central to EQO is the concept of quasi-optimism, where estimated values need not be fully optimistic, allowing for a simpler yet effective exploration strategy. The algorithm achieves the sharpest known regret bound for tabular RL under the mildest assumptions, proving that fast convergence can be attained with a practical and computationally efficient approach. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that EQO consistently outperforms existing algorithms in both regret performance and computational efficiency, providing the best of both theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Underdamped Diffusion Bridges with Applications to Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for learning diffusion bridges that transport prior to target distributions. It includes existing diffusion models for generative modeling, but also underdamped versions with degenerate diffusion matrices, where the noise only acts in certain dimensions. Extending previous findings, our framework allows to rigorously show that score matching in the underdamped case is indeed equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood. Motivated by superior convergence properties and compatibility with sophisticated numerical integration schemes of underdamped stochastic processes, we propose \emph{underdamped diffusion bridges}, where a general density evolution is learned rather than prescribed by a fixed noising process. We apply our method to the challenging task of sampling from unnormalized densities without access to samples from the target distribution. Across a diverse range of sampling problems, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming alternative methods, while requiring significantly fewer discretization steps and no hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Powerful rank verification for multivariate Gaussian data with any covariance structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upon observing $n$-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data, when can we infer that the largest $K$ observations came from the largest $K$ means? When $K=1$ and the covariance is isotropic, \cite{Gutmann} argue that this inference is justified when the two-sided difference-of-means test comparing the largest and second largest observation rejects. Leveraging tools from selective inference, we provide a generalization of their procedure that applies for both any $K$ and any covariance structure. We show that our procedure draws the desired inference whenever the two-sided difference-of-means test comparing the pair of observations inside and outside the top $K$ with the smallest standardized difference rejects, and sometimes even when this test fails to reject. Using this insight, we argue that our procedure renders existing simultaneous inference approaches inadmissible when $n &gt; 2$. When the observations are independent (with possibly unequal variances) or equicorrelated, our procedure corresponds exactly to running the two-sided difference-of-means test comparing the pair of observations inside and outside the top $K$ with the smallest standardized difference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a form of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) where the policy is learned directly from preferential feedback. Although many models of human preferences exist, the critical task of selecting the most informative feedback for training them is under-explored. We propose an active learning framework for DPO, which can be applied to collect human feedback online or to choose the most informative subset of already collected feedback offline. We propose efficient algorithms for both settings. The key idea is to linearize the DPO objective at the last layer of the neural network representation of the optimized policy and then compute the D-optimal design to collect preferential feedback. We prove that the errors in our DPO logit estimates diminish with more feedback. We show the effectiveness of our algorithms empirically in the setting that matches our theory and also on large language models.</description>

      <title>Constrained multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization with automatic stop condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is increasingly employed in critical applications to find the optimal design with minimal cost. While BO is known for its sample efficiency, relying solely on costly high-fidelity data can still result in high costs. This is especially the case in constrained search spaces where BO must not only optimize but also ensure feasibility. A related issue in the BO literature is the lack of a systematic stopping criterion. To solve these challenges, we develop a constrained cost-aware multi-fidelity BO (CMFBO) framework whose goal is to minimize overall sampling costs by utilizing inexpensive low-fidelity sources while ensuring feasibility. In our case, the constraints can change across the data sources and may be even black-box functions. We also introduce a systematic stopping criterion that addresses the long-lasting issue associated with BO's convergence assessment. Our framework is publicly available on GitHub through the GP+ Python package and herein we validate it's efficacy on multiple benchmark problems.</description>

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are a class of implicit neural networks that solve for a fixed point of a neural network in their forward pass. Traditionally, DEQs take sequences as inputs, but have since been applied to a variety of data. In this work, we present Distributional Deep Equilibrium Models (DDEQs), extending DEQs to discrete measure inputs, such as sets or point clouds. We provide a theoretically grounded framework for DDEQs. Leveraging Wasserstein gradient flows, we show how the forward pass of the DEQ can be adapted to find fixed points of discrete measures under permutation-invariance, and derive adequate network architectures for DDEQs. In experiments, we show that they can compete with state-of-the-art models in tasks such as point cloud classification and point cloud completion, while being significantly more parameter-efficient.</description>

      <title>Architectural and Inferential Inductive Biases For Exchangeable Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling exchangeable sequences - i.i.d. observations when conditioned on some latent factor - enabling direct modeling of uncertainty from missing data (rather than a latent). Motivated by the critical role posterior inference plays as a subroutine in decision-making (e.g., active learning, bandits), we study the inferential and architectural inductive biases that are most effective for exchangeable sequence modeling. For the inference stage, we highlight a fundamental limitation of the prevalent single-step generation approach: inability to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Instead, a long line of works in Bayesian statistics advocates for multi-step autoregressive generation; we demonstrate this "correct approach" enables superior uncertainty quantification that translates into better performance on downstream decision-making tasks. This naturally leads to the next question: which architectures are best suited for multi-step inference? We identify a subtle yet important gap between recently proposed Transformer architectures for exchangeable sequences (Muller et al., 2022; Nguyen &amp; Grover, 2022; Ye &amp; Namkoong, 2024), and prove that they in fact cannot guarantee exchangeability despite introducing significant computational overhead. We illustrate our findings using controlled synthetic settings, demonstrating how custom architectures can significantly underperform standard causal masks, underscoring the need for new architectural innovations.</description>

      <title>Robust Simulation-Based Inference under Missing Data via Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods typically require fully observed data to infer parameters of models with intractable likelihood functions. However, datasets often contain missing values due to incomplete observations, data corruptions (common in astrophysics), or instrument limitations (e.g., in high-energy physics applications). In such scenarios, missing data must be imputed before applying any SBI method. We formalize the problem of missing data in SBI and demonstrate that naive imputation methods can introduce bias in the estimation of SBI posterior. We also introduce a novel amortized method that addresses this issue by jointly learning the imputation model and the inference network within a neural posterior estimation (NPE) framework. Extensive empirical results on SBI benchmarks show that our approach provides robust inference outcomes compared to standard baselines for varying levels of missing data. Moreover, we demonstrate the merits of our imputation model on two real-world bioactivity datasets (Adrenergic and Kinase assays).

Specifically, for models with Transformer architecture, the test loss exhibits a power-law relationship with model size, dataset size, and the amount of computation used in training, demonstrating trends that span more than seven orders of magnitude. This scaling law challenges traditional machine learning wisdom, notably the Oscar Scissors principle, which suggests that an overparametrized algorithm will overfit the training datasets, resulting in poor test performance. Recent research has also identified the scaling law in simpler machine learning contexts, such as linear regression. However, fully explaining the scaling law in large practical models remains an elusive goal. In this work, we advance our understanding by demonstrating that the scaling law phenomenon extends to multiple regression and kernel regression settings, which are significantly more expressive and powerful than linear methods. Our analysis provides deeper insights into the scaling law, potentially enhancing our understanding of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Matters even More in Distributed Learning: Study from Generalization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the performance of distributed learning systems, i.e., one-round Federated Learning, as measured by the associated generalization error. Specifically, \(K\) clients have each \(n\) training samples generated independently according to a possibly different data distribution and their individually chosen models are aggregated by a central server. We study the effect of the discrepancy between the clients' data distributions on the generalization error of the aggregated model. First, we establish in-expectation and tail upper bounds on the generalization error in terms of the distributions. In part, the bounds extend the popular Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) bound which was developed for the centralized learning setting, i.e., \(K=1\), to the distributed learning setting with arbitrary number of clients $K \geq 1$. Then, we use a connection with information theoretic rate-distortion theory to derive possibly tighter \textit{lossy} versions of these bounds. Next, we apply our lossy bounds to study the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the generalization error for distributed classification problem in which each client uses Support Vector Machines (D-SVM). In this case, we establish explicit generalization error bounds which depend explicitly on the data heterogeneity degree. It is shown that the bound gets smaller as the degree of data heterogeneity across clients gets higher, thereby suggesting that D-SVM generalizes better when the dissimilarity between the clients' training samples is bigger. This finding, which goes beyond D-SVM, is validated experimentally through a number of experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-attention-based Diffusion Model for Time-series Imputation in Partial Blackout Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing values in multivariate time series data can harm machine learning performance and introduce bias. These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</description>

      <title>Position: Don't use the CLT in LLM evals with fewer than a few hundred datapoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01747v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous statistical evaluations of large language models (LLMs), including valid error bars and significance testing, are essential for meaningful and reliable performance assessment. Currently, when such statistical measures are reported, they typically rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In this position paper, we argue that while CLT-based methods for uncertainty quantification are appropriate when benchmarks consist of thousands of examples, they fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates for LLM evaluations that rely on smaller, highly specialized benchmarks. In these small-data settings, we demonstrate that CLT-based methods perform very poorly, usually dramatically underestimating uncertainty (i.e. producing error bars that are too small). We give recommendations for alternative frequentist and Bayesian methods that are both easy to implement and more appropriate in these increasingly common scenarios. We provide a simple Python library for these Bayesian methods at https://github.com/sambowyer/bayes_evals .</description>

      <title>When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at https://github.com/dayal-kalra/low-memory-adam.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Gradient for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Decoupled Evaluations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization aims to find the Pareto front of trade-offs between a set of expensive objectives while collecting as few samples as possible. In some cases, it is possible to evaluate the objectives separately, and a different latency or evaluation cost can be associated with each objective. This decoupling of the objectives presents an opportunity to learn the Pareto front faster by avoiding unnecessary, expensive evaluations. We propose a scalarization based knowledge gradient acquisition function which accounts for the different evaluation costs of the objectives. We prove asymptotic consistency of the estimator of the optimum for an arbitrary, D-dimensional, real compact search space and show empirically that the algorithm performs comparably with the state of the art and significantly outperforms versions which always evaluate both objectives.</description>

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient alternative to generalized random forests arXiv:1610.01271 (GRFs) for estimating heterogeneous effects in large dimensions. While GRFs rely on a gradient-based splitting criterion, which is large dimensions is computationally expensive and unstable, our method introduces a fixed-point approximation that eliminates the need for Jacobian estimation. This gradient-free approach preserves GRFs theoretical guarantees of consistency and asymptotic normality while significantly improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate that our method achieves multiple times the speed over standard GRFs without compromising statistical accuracy. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data, validate our approach. Our findings suggest that the proposed method is a scalable alternative for localized effect estimation in machine learning and causal inference applications.</description>

      <title>Online Estimation and Inference for Robust Policy Evaluation in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the prominent topics attracting attention in modern statistical learning, with policy evaluation being a key component. Unlike the traditional machine learning literature on this topic, our work emphasizes statistical inference for the model parameters and value functions of reinforcement learning algorithms. While most existing analyses assume random rewards to follow standard distributions, we embrace the concept of robust statistics in reinforcement learning by simultaneously addressing issues of outlier contamination and heavy-tailed rewards within a unified framework. In this paper, we develop a fully online robust policy evaluation procedure, and establish the Bahadur-type representation of our estimator. Furthermore, we develop an online procedure to efficiently conduct statistical inference based on the asymptotic distribution. This paper connects robust statistics and statistical inference in reinforcement learning, offering a more versatile and reliable approach to online policy evaluation. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical experiments conducted in simulations and real-world reinforcement learning experiments.</description>

      <title>Improving LSH via Tensorized Random Projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a fundamental algorithmic toolkit used by data scientists for approximate nearest neighbour search problems that have been used extensively in many large scale data processing applications such as near duplicate detection, nearest neighbour search, clustering, etc. In this work, we aim to propose faster and space efficient locality sensitive hash functions for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity for tensor data. Typically, the naive approach for obtaining LSH for tensor data involves first reshaping the tensor into vectors, followed by applying existing LSH methods for vector data $E2LSH$ and $SRP$. However, this approach becomes impractical for higher order tensors because the size of the reshaped vector becomes exponential in the order of the tensor. Consequently, the size of LSH parameters increases exponentially. To address this problem, we suggest two methods for LSH for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, namely $CP-E2LSH$, $TT-E2LSH$, and $CP-SRP$, $TT-SRP$, respectively, building on $CP$ and tensor train $(TT)$ decompositions techniques. Our approaches are space efficient and can be efficiently applied to low rank $CP$ or $TT$ tensors. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of our proposal on their correctness and efficacy.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Independence Test in the Presence of Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17644v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</description>

      <title>Lasso Bandit with Compatibility Condition on Optimal Arm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic sparse linear bandit problem where only a sparse subset of context features affects the expected reward function, i.e., the unknown reward parameter has a sparse structure. In the existing Lasso bandit literature, the compatibility conditions, together with additional diversity conditions on the context features are imposed to achieve regret bounds that only depend logarithmically on the ambient dimension $d$. In this paper, we demonstrate that even without the additional diversity assumptions, the \textit{compatibility condition on the optimal arm} is sufficient to derive a regret bound that depends logarithmically on $d$, and our assumption is strictly weaker than those used in the lasso bandit literature under the single-parameter setting. We propose an algorithm that adapts the forced-sampling technique and prove that the proposed algorithm achieves $O(\text{poly}\log dT)$ regret under the margin condition. To our knowledge, the proposed algorithm requires the weakest assumptions among Lasso bandit algorithms under the single-parameter setting that achieve $O(\text{poly}\log dT)$ regret. Through numerical experiments, we confirm the superior performance of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of finding the expected value of a statistic of a locally stable point process in a bounded region is addressed. We propose an adaptive importance sampling for solving the problem. In our proposal, we restrict the importance point process to the family of homogeneous Poisson point processes, which enables us to generate quickly independent samples of the importance point process. The optimal intensity of the importance point process is found by applying the cross-entropy minimization method. In the proposed scheme, the expected value of the function and the optimal intensity are iteratively estimated in an adaptive manner. We show that the proposed estimator converges to the target value almost surely, and prove the asymptotic normality of it. We explain how to apply the proposed scheme to the estimation of the intensity of a stationary pairwise interaction point process. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared numerically with the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and the perfect sampling.</description>

Abstract: We develop VSD, a method for conditioning a generative model of discrete, combinatorial designs on a rare desired class by efficiently evaluating a black-box (e.g. experiment, simulation) in a batch sequential manner. We call this task active generation; we formalize active generation's requirements and desiderata, and formulate a solution via variational inference. VSD uses off-the-shelf gradient based optimization routines, can learn powerful generative models for desirable designs, and can take advantage of scalable predictive models. We derive asymptotic convergence rates for learning the true conditional generative distribution of designs with certain configurations of our method. After illustrating the generative model on images, we empirically demonstrate that VSD can outperform existing baseline methods on a set of real sequence-design problems in various protein and DNA/RNA engineering tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Universality of Transformers for Next-Token Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal Transformers are trained to predict the next token for a given context. While it is widely accepted that self-attention is crucial for encoding the causal structure of sequences, the precise underlying mechanism behind this in-context autoregressive learning ability remains unclear. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding this phenomenon by studying the approximation ability of Transformers for next-token prediction. Specifically, we explore the capacity of causal Transformers to predict the next token $x_{t+1}$ given an autoregressive sequence $(x_1, \dots, x_t)$ as a prompt, where $ x_{t+1} = f(x_t) $, and $ f $ is a context-dependent function that varies with each sequence. On the theoretical side, we focus on specific instances, namely when $ f $ is linear or when $ (x_t)_{t \geq 1} $ is periodic. We explicitly construct a Transformer (with linear, exponential, or softmax attention) that learns the mapping $f$ in-context through a causal kernel descent method. The causal kernel descent method we propose provably estimates $x_{t+1} $ based solely on past and current observations $ (x_1, \dots, x_t) $, with connections to the Kaczmarz algorithm in Hilbert spaces. We present experimental results that validate our theoretical findings and suggest their applicability to more general mappings $f$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting cost-effective optimal sensor configurations for subsequent inference of parameters in black-box stochastic systems faces significant computational barriers. We propose a novel and robust approach, modelling the joint distribution over input parameters and solution with a joint energy-based model, trained on simulation data. Unlike existing simulation-based inference approaches, which must be tied to a specific set of point evaluations, we learn a functional representation of parameters and solution. This is used as a resolution-independent plug-and-play surrogate for the joint distribution, which can be conditioned over any set of points, permitting an efficient approach to sensor placement. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on a variety of stochastic problems, showing that our method provides highly informative sensor locations at a lower computational cost compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Probing the Latent Hierarchical Structure of Data via Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional data must be highly structured to be learnable. Although the compositional and hierarchical nature of data is often put forward to explain learnability, quantitative measurements establishing these properties are scarce. Likewise, accessing the latent variables underlying such a data structure remains a challenge. In this work, we show that forward-backward experiments in diffusion-based models, where data is noised and then denoised to generate new samples, are a promising tool to probe the latent structure of data. We predict in simple hierarchical models that, in this process, changes in data occur by correlated chunks, with a length scale that diverges at a noise level where a phase transition is known to take place. Remarkably, we confirm this prediction in both text and image datasets using state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our results show how latent variable changes manifest in the data and establish how to measure these effects in real data using diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that APPEX iteratively decreases Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true solution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret of Linear Ensemble Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we close the fundamental gap of theory and practice by providing an improved regret bound for linear ensemble sampling. We prove that with an ensemble size logarithmic in $T$, linear ensemble sampling can achieve a frequentist regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, matching state-of-the-art results for randomized linear bandit algorithms, where $d$ and $T$ are the dimension of the parameter and the time horizon respectively. Our approach introduces a general regret analysis framework for linear bandit algorithms. Additionally, we reveal a significant relationship between linear ensemble sampling and Linear Perturbed-History Exploration (LinPHE), showing that LinPHE is a special case of linear ensemble sampling when the ensemble size equals $T$. This insight allows us to derive a new regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ for LinPHE, independent of the number of arms. Our contributions advance the theoretical foundation of ensemble sampling, bringing its regret bounds in line with the best known bounds for other randomized exploration algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Feature Learning in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The predominant success of diffusion models in generative modeling has spurred significant interest in understanding their theoretical foundations. In this work, we propose a feature learning framework aimed at analyzing and comparing the training dynamics of diffusion models with those of traditional classification models. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that diffusion models, due to the denoising objective, are encouraged to learn more balanced and comprehensive representations of the data. In contrast, neural networks with a similar architecture trained for classification tend to prioritize learning specific patterns in the data, often focusing on easy-to-learn components. To support these theoretical insights, we conduct several experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which empirically validate our findings and highlight the distinct feature learning dynamics in diffusion models compared to classification.</description>

      <title>Integrated Gradient attribution for Gaussian Processes with non-Gaussian likelihoods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) models are a powerful tool in probabilistic machine learning with a solid theoretical foundation. Thanks to current advances, modeling complex data with GPs is becoming increasingly feasible, which makes them an interesting alternative to deep learning and related approaches. As the latter are getting more and more influential on society, the need for making a model's decision making process transparent and explainable is now a major focus of research. A major direction in interpretable machine learning is the use of gradient-based approaches, such as Integrated Gradients, to quantify feature attribution, locally for a given datapoint of interest. Since GPs and the behavior of their partial derivatives are well studied and straightforward to derive, studying gradient-based explainability for GPs is a promising direction of research. Unfortunately, partial derivatives for GPs become less trivial to handle when dealing with non-Gaussian target data as in classification or more sophisticated regression problems. This paper therefore proposes an approach for applying Integrated Gradient-based explainability to non-Gaussian GP models, offering both analytical and approximate solutions. This extends gradient-based explainability to probabilistic models with complex likelihoods to extend their practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Scaling ResNets in the Large-depth Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep ResNets are recognized for achieving state-of-the-art results in complex machine learning tasks. However, the remarkable performance of these architectures relies on a training procedure that needs to be carefully crafted to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients, particularly as the depth $L$ increases. No consensus has been reached on how to mitigate this issue, although a widely discussed strategy consists in scaling the output of each layer by a factor $\alpha_L$. We show in a probabilistic setting that with standard i.i.d.~initializations, the only non-trivial dynamics is for $\alpha_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L}}$; other choices lead either to explosion or to identity mapping. This scaling factor corresponds in the continuous-time limit to a neural stochastic differential equation, contrarily to a widespread interpretation that deep ResNets are discretizations of neural ordinary differential equations. By contrast, in the latter regime, stability is obtained with specific correlated initializations and $\alpha_L = \frac{1}{L}$. Our analysis suggests a strong interplay between scaling and regularity of the weights as a function of the layer index. Finally, in a series of experiments, we exhibit a continuous range of regimes driven by these two parameters, which jointly impact performance before and after training.</description>

      <title>Do PAC-Learners Learn the Marginal Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of PAC Learning asserts that learnability of a concept class $H$ is equivalent to the $\textit{uniform convergence}$ of empirical error in $H$ to its mean, or equivalently, to the problem of $\textit{density estimation}$, learnability of the underlying marginal distribution with respect to events in $H$. This seminal equivalence relies strongly on PAC learning's `distribution-free' assumption, that the adversary may choose any marginal distribution over data. Unfortunately, the distribution-free model is known to be overly adversarial in practice, failing to predict the success of modern machine learning algorithms, but without the Fundamental Theorem our theoretical understanding of learning under distributional constraints remains highly limited.
  In this work, we revisit the connection between PAC learning, uniform convergence, and density estimation beyond the distribution-free setting when the adversary is restricted to choosing a marginal distribution from a known family $\mathscr{P}$. We prove that while the traditional Fundamental Theorem indeed fails, a finer-grained connection between the three fundamental notions continues to hold:
  1. PAC-Learning is strictly sandwiched between two refined models of density estimation, differing only in whether the learner $\textit{knows}$ the set of well-estimated events in $H$.
  2. Under reasonable assumptions on $H$ and $\mathscr{P}$, density estimation is equivalent to $\textit{uniform estimation}$, a relaxation of uniform convergence allowing non-empirical estimators.
  Together, our results give a clearer picture of how the Fundamental Theorem extends beyond the distribution-free setting and shed new light on the classically challenging problem of learning under arbitrary distributional assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many standard estimators, when applied to adaptively collected data, fail to be asymptotically normal, thereby complicating the construction of confidence intervals. We address this challenge in a semi-parametric context: estimating the parameter vector of a generalized linear regression model contaminated by a non-parametric nuisance component. We construct suitably weighted estimating equations that account for adaptivity in data collection, and provide conditions under which the associated estimates are asymptotically normal. Our results characterize the degree of "explorability" required for asymptotic normality to hold. For the simpler problem of estimating a linear functional, we provide similar guarantees under much weaker assumptions. We illustrate our general theory with concrete consequences for various problems, including standard linear bandits and sparse generalized bandits, and compare with other methods via simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Approaches for Balancing Performance and Theoretical Guarantees in Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by recent research in the $d$-dimensional stochastic linear bandit literature, which has revealed an unsettling discrepancy: algorithms like Thompson sampling and Greedy demonstrate promising empirical performance, yet this contrasts with their pessimistic theoretical regret bounds. The challenge arises from the fact that while these algorithms may perform poorly in certain problem instances, they generally excel in typical instances. To address this, we propose a new data-driven technique that tracks the geometric properties of the uncertainty ellipsoid around the main problem parameter. This methodology enables us to formulate a data-driven frequentist regret bound, which incorporates the geometric information, for a broad class of base algorithms, including Greedy, OFUL, and Thompson sampling. This result allows us to identify and ``course-correct" problem instances in which the base algorithms perform poorly. The course-corrected algorithms achieve the minimax optimal regret of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ for a $T$-period decision-making scenario, effectively maintaining the desirable attributes of the base algorithms, including their empirical efficacy. We present simulation results to validate our findings using synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Assessing Robustness via Score-Based Adversarial Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most adversarial attacks and defenses focus on perturbations within small $\ell_p$-norm constraints. However, $\ell_p$ threat models cannot capture all relevant semantics-preserving perturbations, and hence, the scope of robustness evaluations is limited. In this work, we introduce Score-Based Adversarial Generation (ScoreAG), a novel framework that leverages the advancements in score-based generative models to generate unrestricted adversarial examples that overcome the limitations of $\ell_p$-norm constraints. Unlike traditional methods, ScoreAG maintains the core semantics of images while generating adversarial examples, either by transforming existing images or synthesizing new ones entirely from scratch. We further exploit the generative capability of ScoreAG to purify images, empirically enhancing the robustness of classifiers. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that ScoreAG improves upon the majority of state-of-the-art attacks and defenses across multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the importance of investigating adversarial examples bounded by semantics rather than $\ell_p$-norm constraints. ScoreAG represents an important step towards more encompassing robustness assessments.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathcal{L}^2$ minimization at uniform exponential rate via geometrically adapted gradient descent in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15487v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of supervised learning in Deep Learning (DL) networks, and exploit the arbitrariness of choice in the Riemannian metric relative to which the gradient descent flow can be defined (a general fact of differential geometry). In the standard approach to DL, the gradient flow on the space of parameters (weights and biases) is defined with respect to the Euclidean metric. Here instead, we choose the gradient flow with respect to the Euclidean metric in the output layer of the DL network. This naturally induces two modified versions of the gradient descent flow in the parameter space, one adapted for the overparametrized setting, and the other for the underparametrized setting. In the overparametrized case, we prove that, provided that a rank condition holds, all orbits of the modified gradient descent drive the ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost to its global minimum at a uniform exponential convergence rate; one thereby obtains an a priori stopping time for any prescribed proximity to the global minimum. We point out relations of the latter to sub-Riemannian geometry. Moreover, we generalize the above framework to the situation in which the rank condition does not hold; in particular, we show that local equilibria can only exist if a rank loss occurs, and that generically, they are not isolated points, but elements of a critical submanifold of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Adversarial Training Estimator under $\ell_\infty$-Perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training has been proposed to protect machine learning models against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on adversarial training under $\ell_\infty$-perturbation, which has recently attracted much research attention. The asymptotic behavior of the adversarial training estimator is investigated in the generalized linear model. The results imply that the asymptotic distribution of the adversarial training estimator under $\ell_\infty$-perturbation could put a positive probability mass at $0$ when the true parameter is $0$, providing a theoretical guarantee of the associated sparsity-recovery ability. Alternatively, a two-step procedure is proposed -- adaptive adversarial training, which could further improve the performance of adversarial training under $\ell_\infty$-perturbation. Specifically, the proposed procedure could achieve asymptotic variable-selection consistency and unbiasedness. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the sparsity-recovery ability of adversarial training under $\ell_\infty$-perturbation and to compare the empirical performance between classic adversarial training and adaptive adversarial training.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05569v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08156v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can agents exchange information to learn while protecting privacy? Healthcare centers collaborating on clinical trials must balance knowledge sharing with safeguarding sensitive patient data. We address this challenge by using differential privacy (DP) to control information leakage. Agents update belief statistics via log-linear rules, and DP noise provides plausible deniability and rigorous performance guarantees. We study two settings: distributed maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a finite set of private signals and online learning from an intermittent signal stream. Noisy aggregation introduces trade-offs between rejecting low-quality states and accepting high-quality ones. The MLE setting naturally applies to binary hypothesis testing with formal statistical guarantees. Through simulations, we demonstrate differentially private, distributed survival analysis on real-world clinical trial data, evaluating treatment efficacy and the impact of biomedical indices on patient survival. Our methods enable privacy-preserving inference with greater efficiency and lower error rates than homomorphic encryption and first-order DP optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Signature Kernel Conditional Independence Tests in Causal Discovery for Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the causal structure underlying stochastic dynamical systems from observational data holds great promise in domains ranging from science and health to finance. Such processes can often be accurately modeled via stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which naturally imply causal relationships via "which variables enter the differential of which other variables". In this paper, we develop conditional independence (CI) constraints on coordinate processes over selected intervals that are Markov with respect to the acyclic dependence graph (allowing self-loops) induced by a general SDE model. We then provide a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm, capable of handling both fully and partially observed data, and uniquely recovering the underlying or induced ancestral graph by exploiting time directionality assuming a CI oracle. Finally, to make our algorithm practically usable, we also propose a flexible, consistent signature kernel-based CI test to infer these constraints from data. We extensively benchmark the CI test in isolation and as part of our causal discovery algorithms, outperforming existing approaches in SDE models and beyond.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nystr\"om approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nystr\"om approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that the approximated Riccati operator converges at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converges at the rate $m^{-1}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Mean Square Error Optimality of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) as generative priors have recently shown great potential for denoising tasks but lack theoretical understanding with respect to their mean square error (MSE) optimality. This paper proposes a novel denoising strategy inspired by the structure of the MSE-optimal conditional mean estimator (CME). The resulting DM-based denoiser can be conveniently employed using a pre-trained DM, being particularly fast by truncating reverse diffusion steps and not requiring stochastic re-sampling. We present a comprehensive (non-)asymptotic optimality analysis of the proposed diffusion-based denoiser, demonstrating polynomial-time convergence to the CME under mild conditions. Our analysis also derives a novel Lipschitz constant that depends solely on the DM's hyperparameters. Further, we offer a new perspective on DMs, showing that they inherently combine an asymptotically optimal denoiser with a powerful generator, modifiable by switching re-sampling in the reverse process on or off. The theoretical findings are thoroughly validated with experiments based on various benchmark datasets</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How is knowledge stored in an LLM's weights? We study this via layer pruning: if removing a certain layer does not affect model performance in common question-answering benchmarks, then the weights in that layer are not necessary for storing the knowledge needed to answer those questions. To find these unnecessary parameters, we identify the optimal block of layers to prune by considering similarity across layers; then, to "heal" the damage, we perform a small amount of finetuning. Surprisingly, with this method we find minimal degradation of performance until after a large fraction (up to half) of the layers are removed for some common open-weight models. From a scientific perspective, the robustness of these LLMs to the deletion of layers implies either that current pretraining methods are not properly leveraging the parameters in the deeper layers of the network or that the shallow layers play a critical role in storing knowledge. For our study, we use parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods, specifically quantization and Low Rank Adapters (QLoRA), such that each of our experiments can be performed on a single 40GB A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation: a case study for understanding warm starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10044v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training. While our main focus is on this case study of variational quantum simulation, we end by discussing how our results work in other iterative settings.</description>

      <title>Randomized Exploration in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first study on provably efficient randomized exploration in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose a unified algorithm framework for randomized exploration in parallel Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and two Thompson Sampling (TS)-type algorithms, CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC, incorporating the perturbed-history exploration (PHE) strategy and the Langevin Monte Carlo exploration (LMC) strategy, respectively, which are flexible in design and easy to implement in practice. For a special class of parallel MDPs where the transition is (approximately) linear, we theoretically prove that both CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC achieve a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}H^2\sqrt{MK})$ regret bound with communication complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dHM^2)$, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the horizon length, $M$ is the number of agents, and $K$ is the number of episodes. This is the first theoretical result for randomized exploration in cooperative MARL. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple parallel RL environments, including a deep exploration problem (i.e., $N$-chain), a video game, and a real-world problem in energy systems. Our experimental results support that our framework can achieve better performance, even under conditions of misspecified transition models. Additionally, we establish a connection between our unified framework and the practical application of federated learning.</description>

      <title>Lean Copilot: Large Language Models as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural theorem proving combines large language models (LLMs) with proof assistants such as Lean, where the correctness of formal proofs can be rigorously verified, leaving no room for hallucination. With existing neural theorem provers pretrained on a fixed collection of data and offering valuable suggestions at times, it is challenging for them to continually prove novel theorems in a fully autonomous mode, where human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, an general framework for running LLM inference natively in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Lean users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Using Lean Copilot, we build LLM-based tools that suggest proof steps, complete proof goals, and select relevant premises. Experimental results on the Mathematics in Lean textbook demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean (aesop). When assisting humans, Lean Copilot requires only 2.08 manually-entered proof steps on average (3.86 required by aesop); when automating the theorem proving process, Lean Copilot automates 74.2% proof steps on average, 85% better than aesop (40.1%). We open source all code and artifacts under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Local convergence of simultaneous min-max algorithms to differential equilibrium on Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study min-max algorithms to solve zero-sum differential games on Riemannian manifold. Based on the notions of differential Stackelberg equilibrium and differential Nash equilibrium on Riemannian manifold, we analyze the local convergence of two representative deterministic simultaneous algorithms $\tau$-GDA and $\tau$-SGA to such equilibria. Sufficient conditions are obtained to establish the linear convergence rate of $\tau$-GDA based on the Ostrowski theorem on manifold and spectral analysis. To avoid strong rotational dynamics in $\tau$-GDA, $\tau$-SGA is extended from the symplectic gradient-adjustment method in Euclidean space. We analyze an asymptotic approximation of $\tau$-SGA when the learning rate ratio $\tau$ is big. In some cases, it can achieve a faster convergence rate to differential Stackelberg equilibrium compared to $\tau$-GDA. We show numerically how the insights obtained from the convergence analysis may improve the training of orthogonal Wasserstein GANs using stochastic $\tau$-GDA and $\tau$-SGA on simple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MallowsPO: Fine-Tune Your LLM with Preference Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the MallowsPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities. MallowsPO is also compatible with other SOTA offline preference optimization methods, boosting nearly 2\% extra LC win rate when used as a plugin for fine-tuning Llama3-Instruct.</description>

      <title>Does SGD really happen in tiny subspaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature and intricate loss landscapes. Recent studies have revealed that, along the training trajectory, the gradient approximately aligns with a low-rank top eigenspace of the training loss Hessian, referred to as the dominant subspace. Given this alignment, this paper explores whether neural networks can be trained within the dominant subspace, which, if feasible, could lead to more efficient training methods. Our primary observation is that when the SGD update is projected onto the dominant subspace, the training loss does not decrease further. This suggests that the observed alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace is spurious. Surprisingly, projecting out the dominant subspace proves to be just as effective as the original update, despite removing the majority of the original update component. We observe similar behavior across practical setups, including the large learning rate regime (also known as Edge of Stability), Sharpness-Aware Minimization, momentum, and adaptive optimizers. We discuss the main causes and implications of this spurious alignment, shedding light on the dynamics of neural network training.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate, which can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide a quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models with different noise schedules and the different data. We numerically discuss our results for the optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also show the inaccurate data generation due to the non-conservative force, and the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work employs a pair of "least-favorable" distributions to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Representations through Multi-task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent perception and interaction with the world hinges on internal representations that capture its underlying structure (''disentangled'' or ''abstract'' representations). Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along approximately orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence accumulation classification tasks, canonical in the neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence accumulation time. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained to multi-task, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework establishes a formal link between competence at multiple tasks and the formation of disentangled, interpretable world models in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</description>

      <title>Minimal Variance Model Aggregation: A principled, non-intrusive, and versatile integration of black box models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether deterministic or stochastic, models can be viewed as functions designed to approximate a specific quantity of interest. We introduce Minimal Empirical Variance Aggregation (MEVA), a data-driven framework that integrates predictions from various models, enhancing overall accuracy by leveraging the individual strengths of each. This non-intrusive, model-agnostic approach treats the contributing models as black boxes and accommodates outputs from diverse methodologies, including machine learning algorithms and traditional numerical solvers. We advocate for a point-wise linear aggregation process and consider two methods for optimizing this aggregate: Minimal Error Aggregation (MEA), which minimizes the prediction error, and Minimal Variance Aggregation (MVA), which focuses on reducing variance. We prove a theorem showing that MVA can be more robustly estimated from data than MEA, making MEVA superior to Minimal Empirical Error Aggregation (MEEA). Unlike MEEA, which interpolates target values directly, MEVA formulates aggregation as an error estimation problem, which can be performed using any backbone learning paradigm. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our framework across various applications, including data science and partial differential equations, illustrating its ability to significantly enhance both robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Policy Gradient for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback without Reward Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward inference (learning a reward model from human preferences) is a critical intermediate step in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, RLHF faces fundamental challenges such as distribution shift, reward model overfitting, and problem misspecification. An alternative approach is direct policy optimization without reward inference, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which provides a much simpler pipeline and has shown empirical success in LLM applications. However, DPO utilizes the closed-form expression between the optimal policy and the reward function, which is only suitable under the bandit setting or deterministic MDPs. This paper develops two RLHF algorithms without reward inference for general RL problems beyond bandits and deterministic MDPs, and general preference models beyond the Bradley-Terry model. The key idea is to estimate the local value function difference from human preferences and then approximate the policy gradient with a zeroth-order gradient approximator. For both algorithms, we establish polynomial convergence rates in terms of the number of policy gradient iterations, the number of trajectory samples, and human preference queries per iteration. Numerical experiments in stochastic environments validate the performance of our proposed algorithms, outperforming popular RLHF baselines such as DPO and PPO. Our paper shows there exist provably efficient methods to solve general RLHF problems without reward inference.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Probabilistic Forecasts for Arbitrary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world data streams can change unpredictably due to distribution shifts, feedback loops and adversarial actors, which challenges the validity of forecasts. We present a forecasting framework ensuring valid uncertainty estimates regardless of how data evolves. Leveraging the concept of Blackwell approachability from game theory, we introduce a forecasting framework that guarantees calibrated uncertainties for outcomes in any compact space (e.g., classification or bounded regression). We extend this framework to recalibrate existing forecasters, guaranteeing calibration without sacrificing predictive performance. We implement both general-purpose gradient-based algorithms and algorithms optimized for popular special cases of our framework. Empirically, our algorithms improve calibration and downstream decision-making for energy systems.</description>

      <title>How Discrete and Continuous Diffusion Meet: Comprehensive Analysis of Discrete Diffusion Models via a Stochastic Integral Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have gained increasing attention for their ability to model complex distributions with tractable sampling and inference. However, the error analysis for discrete diffusion models remains less well-understood. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework for the error analysis of discrete diffusion models based on L\'evy-type stochastic integrals. By generalizing the Poisson random measure to that with a time-independent and state-dependent intensity, we rigorously establish a stochastic integral formulation of discrete diffusion models and provide the corresponding change of measure theorems that are intriguingly analogous to It\^o integrals and Girsanov's theorem for their continuous counterparts. Our framework unifies and strengthens the current theoretical results on discrete diffusion models and obtains the first error bound for the $\tau$-leaping scheme in KL divergence. With error sources clearly identified, our analysis gives new insight into the mathematical properties of discrete diffusion models and offers guidance for the design of efficient and accurate algorithms for real-world discrete diffusion model applications.</description>

      <title>The Optimization Landscape of SGD Across the Feature Learning Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider neural networks (NNs) where the final layer is down-scaled by a fixed hyperparameter $\gamma$. Recent work has identified $\gamma$ as controlling the strength of feature learning. As $\gamma$ increases, network evolution changes from "lazy" kernel dynamics to "rich" feature-learning dynamics, with a host of associated benefits including improved performance on common tasks. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation of the effect of scaling $\gamma$ across a variety of models and datasets in the online training setting. We first examine the interaction of $\gamma$ with the learning rate $\eta$, identifying several scaling regimes in the $\gamma$-$\eta$ plane which we explain theoretically using a simple model. We find that the optimal learning rate $\eta^*$ scales non-trivially with $\gamma$. In particular, $\eta^* \propto \gamma^2$ when $\gamma \ll 1$ and $\eta^* \propto \gamma^{2/L}$ when $\gamma \gg 1$ for a feed-forward network of depth $L$. Using this optimal learning rate scaling, we proceed with an empirical study of the under-explored "ultra-rich" $\gamma \gg 1$ regime. We find that networks in this regime display characteristic loss curves, starting with a long plateau followed by a drop-off, sometimes followed by one or more additional staircase steps. We find networks of different large $\gamma$ values optimize along similar trajectories up to a reparameterization of time. We further find that optimal online performance is often found at large $\gamma$ and could be missed if this hyperparameter is not tuned. Our findings indicate that analytical study of the large-$\gamma$ limit may yield useful insights into the dynamics of representation learning in performant models.</description>

      <title>Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Timer-XL, a causal Transformer for unified time series forecasting. To uniformly predict multidimensional time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for 1D token sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The paradigm formulates various forecasting tasks as a long-context prediction problem. We opt for decoder-only Transformers that capture causal dependencies from varying-length contexts for unified forecasting, making predictions on non-stationary univariate time series, multivariate series with complicated dynamics and correlations, as well as covariate-informed contexts that include exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches), which is further enhanced by deft position embedding for temporal causality and variable equivalence. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across task-specific forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. Based on large-scale pre-training, Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, making it a promising architecture for pre-trained time series models. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/Timer-XL.</description>

      <title>On the Optimization and Generalization of Two-layer Transformers with Sign Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Adam optimizer is widely used for transformer optimization in practice, which makes understanding the underlying optimization mechanisms an important problem. However, due to the Adam's complexity, theoretical analysis of how it optimizes transformers remains a challenging task. Fortunately, Sign Gradient Descent (SignGD) serves as an effective surrogate for Adam. Despite its simplicity, theoretical understanding of how SignGD optimizes transformers still lags behind. In this work, we study how SignGD optimizes a two-layer transformer -- consisting of a softmax attention layer with trainable query-key parameterization followed by a linear layer -- on a linearly separable noisy dataset. We identify four stages in the training dynamics, each exhibiting intriguing behaviors. Based on the training dynamics, we prove the fast convergence but poor generalization of the learned transformer on the noisy dataset. We also show that Adam behaves similarly to SignGD in terms of both optimization and generalization in this setting. Additionally, we find that the poor generalization of SignGD is not solely due to data noise, suggesting that both SignGD and Adam requires high-quality data for real-world tasks. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets empirically support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent with the Richardson-Romberg Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of solving strongly convex and smooth minimization problems using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with a constant step size. Previous works suggested to combine the Polyak-Ruppert averaging procedure with the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation to reduce the asymptotic bias of SGD at the expense of a mild increase of the variance. We significantly extend previous results by providing an expansion of the mean-squared error of the resulting estimator with respect to the number of iterations $n$. We show that the root mean-squared error can be decomposed into the sum of two terms: a leading one of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ with explicit dependence on a minimax-optimal asymptotic covariance matrix, and a second-order term of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-3/4})$, where the power $3/4$ is best known. We also extend this result to the higher-order moment bounds. Our analysis relies on the properties of the SGD iterates viewed as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. In particular, we establish that this chain is geometrically ergodic with respect to a suitably defined weighted Wasserstein semimetric.</description>

      <title>SymDiff: Equivariant Diffusion via Stochastic Symmetrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SymDiff, a method for constructing equivariant diffusion models using the framework of stochastic symmetrisation. SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. In contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterisations or the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit for $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</description>

      <title>Feature Averaging: An Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent Leading to Non-Robustness in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a particular implicit bias in gradient descent training, which we term "Feature Averaging," and argue that it is one of the principal factors contributing to the non-robustness of deep neural networks. We show that, even when multiple discriminative features are present in the input data, neural networks trained by gradient descent tend to rely on an average (or a certain combination) of these features for classification, rather than distinguishing and leveraging each feature individually. Specifically, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of two-layer ReLU networks on a binary classification task, where the data distribution consists of multiple clusters with mutually orthogonal centers. We rigorously prove that gradient descent biases the network towards feature averaging, where the weights of each hidden neuron represent an average of the cluster centers (each corresponding to a distinct feature), thereby making the network vulnerable to input perturbations aligned with the negative direction of the averaged features. On the positive side, we demonstrate that this vulnerability can be mitigated through more granular supervision. In particular, we prove that a two-layer ReLU network can achieve optimal robustness when trained to classify individual features rather than merely the original binary classes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on synthetic datasets, MNIST, and CIFAR-10, and confirm the prevalence of feature averaging and its impact on adversarial robustness. We hope these theoretical and empirical insights deepen the understanding of how gradient descent shapes feature learning and adversarial robustness, and how more detailed supervision can enhance robustness.</description>

      <title>Simplifying, Stabilizing and Scaling Continuous-Time Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consistency models (CMs) are a powerful class of diffusion-based generative models optimized for fast sampling. Most existing CMs are trained using discretized timesteps, which introduce additional hyperparameters and are prone to discretization errors. While continuous-time formulations can mitigate these issues, their success has been limited by training instability. To address this, we propose a simplified theoretical framework that unifies previous parameterizations of diffusion models and CMs, identifying the root causes of instability. Based on this analysis, we introduce key improvements in diffusion process parameterization, network architecture, and training objectives. These changes enable us to train continuous-time CMs at an unprecedented scale, reaching 1.5B parameters on ImageNet 512x512. Our proposed training algorithm, using only two sampling steps, achieves FID scores of 2.06 on CIFAR-10, 1.48 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.88 on ImageNet 512x512, narrowing the gap in FID scores with the best existing diffusion models to within 10%.</description>

      <title>Data-adaptive Differentially Private Prompt Synthesis for In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the contextual information embedded in examples/demonstrations to perform in-context learning (ICL). To mitigate the risk of LLMs potentially leaking private information contained in examples in the prompt, we introduce a novel data-adaptive differentially private algorithm called AdaDPSyn to generate synthetic examples from the private dataset and then use these synthetic examples to perform ICL. The objective of AdaDPSyn is to adaptively adjust the noise level in the data synthesis mechanism according to the inherent statistical properties of the data, thereby preserving high ICL accuracy while maintaining formal differential privacy guarantees. A key innovation in AdaDPSyn is the Precision-Focused Iterative Radius Reduction technique, which dynamically refines the aggregation radius - the scope of data grouping for noise addition - based on patterns observed in data clustering, thereby minimizing the amount of additive noise. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and compare AdaDPSyn with DP few-shot generation algorithm (Tang et al., 2023). The experiments demonstrate that AdaDPSyn not only outperforms DP few-shot generation, but also maintains high accuracy levels close to those of non-private baselines, providing an effective solution for ICL with privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Linear cost and exponentially convergent approximation of Gaussian Mat\'ern processes on intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational cost for inference and prediction of statistical models based on Gaussian processes with Mat\'ern covariance functions scales cubicly with the number of observations, limiting their applicability to large data sets. The cost can be reduced in certain special cases, but there are currently no generally applicable exact methods with linear cost. Several approximate methods have been introduced to reduce the cost, but most of these lack theoretical guarantees for the accuracy. We consider Gaussian processes on bounded intervals with Mat\'ern covariance functions and for the first time develop a generally applicable method with linear cost and with a covariance error that decreases exponentially fast in the order $m$ of the proposed approximation. The method is based on an optimal rational approximation of the spectral density and results in an approximation that can be represented as a sum of $m$ independent Gaussian Markov processes, which facilitates easy usage in general software for statistical inference, enabling its efficient implementation in general statistical inference software packages. Besides the theoretical justifications, we demonstrate the accuracy empirically through carefully designed simulation studies which show that the method outperforms all state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy for a fixed computational cost in statistical tasks such as Gaussian process regression.</description>

      <title>LDAdam: Adaptive Optimization from Low-Dimensional Gradient Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LDAdam, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large models, that performs adaptive optimization steps within lower dimensional subspaces, while consistently exploring the full parameter space during training. This strategy keeps the optimizer's memory footprint to a fraction of the model size. LDAdam relies on a new projection-aware update rule for the optimizer states that allows for transitioning between subspaces, i.e., estimation of the statistics of the projected gradients. To mitigate the errors due to low-rank projection, LDAdam integrates a new generalized error feedback mechanism, which explicitly accounts for both gradient and optimizer state compression. We prove the convergence of LDAdam under standard assumptions, and show that LDAdam allows for accurate and efficient fine-tuning and pre-training of language models.

      <title>L3Ms - Lagrange Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem: the LLM is fine-tuned on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Learning Approach to Bayesian Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering a unique causal structure is difficult due to both inherent identifiability issues, and the consequences of finite data. As such, uncertainty over causal structures, such as those obtained from a Bayesian posterior, are often necessary for downstream tasks. Finding an accurate approximation to this posterior is challenging, due to the large number of possible causal graphs, as well as the difficulty in the subproblem of finding posteriors over the functional relationships of the causal edges. Recent works have used meta-learning to view the problem of estimating the maximum a-posteriori causal graph as supervised learning. Yet, these methods are limited when estimating the full posterior as they fail to encode key properties of the posterior, such as correlation between edges and permutation equivariance with respect to nodes. Further, these methods also cannot reliably sample from the posterior over causal structures. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian meta learning model that allows for sampling causal structures from the posterior and encodes these key properties. We compare our meta-Bayesian causal discovery against existing Bayesian causal discovery methods, demonstrating the advantages of directly learning a posterior over causal structure.</description>

      <title>Bayesian penalized empirical likelihood and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework called Bayesian Penalized Empirical Likelihood (BPEL), designed to address the computational challenges inherent in empirical likelihood (EL) approaches. Our approach has two primary objectives: (i) to enhance the inherent flexibility of EL in accommodating diverse model conditions, and (ii) to facilitate the use of well-established Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling schemes as a convenient alternative to the complex optimization typically required for statistical inference using EL. To achieve the first objective, we propose a penalized approach that regularizes the Lagrange multipliers, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the problem while accommodating a comprehensive set of model conditions. For the second objective, our study designs and thoroughly investigates two popular sampling schemes within the BPEL context. We demonstrate that the BPEL framework is highly flexible and efficient, enhancing the adaptability and practicality of EL methods. Our study highlights the practical advantages of using sampling techniques over traditional optimization methods for EL problems, showing rapid convergence to the global optima of posterior distributions and ensuring the effective resolution of complex statistical inference challenges.</description>

      <title>PEARL: Preconditioner Enhancement through Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PEARL (Preconditioner Enhancement through Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning), a novel approach to learning matrix preconditioners. Existing preconditioners such as Jacobi, Incomplete LU, and Algebraic Multigrid methods offer problem-specific advantages but rely heavily on hyperparameter tuning. Recent advances have explored using deep neural networks to learn preconditioners, though challenges such as misbehaved objective functions and costly training procedures remain. PEARL introduces a reinforcement learning approach for learning preconditioners, specifically, a contextual bandit formulation. The framework utilizes an actor-critic model, where the actor generates the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of preconditioners, and the critic evaluates them based on reward-specific feedback. To further guide the training, we design a dual-objective function, combining updates from the critic and condition number. PEARL contributes a generalizable preconditioner learning method, dynamic sparsity exploration, and cosine schedulers for improved stability and exploratory power. We compare our approach to traditional and neural preconditioners, demonstrating improved flexibility and iterative solving speed.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Multi-Objective Deep Learning: Algorithms, Theories, Applications, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) in deep learning aims to simultaneously optimize multiple conflicting objectives, a challenge frequently encountered in areas like multi-task learning and multi-criteria learning. Recent advancements in gradient-based MOO methods have enabled the discovery of diverse types of solutions, ranging from a single balanced solution to finite or even infinite Pareto sets, tailored to user needs. These developments have broad applications across domains such as reinforcement learning, computer vision, recommendation systems, and large language models. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of gradient-based MOO in deep learning, covering algorithms, theories, and practical applications. By unifying various approaches and identifying critical challenges, it serves as a foundational resource for driving innovation in this evolving field. A comprehensive list of MOO algorithms in deep learning is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/Awesome-Multi-Objective-Deep-Learning.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Capabilities and Limitations of Weak-to-Strong Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization, where weakly supervised strong models outperform their weaker teachers, offers a promising approach to aligning superhuman models with human values. To deepen the understanding of this approach, we provide theoretical insights into its capabilities and limitations. First, in the classification setting, we establish upper and lower generalization error bounds for the strong model, identifying the primary limitations as stemming from the weak model's generalization error and the optimization objective itself. Additionally, we derive lower and upper bounds on the calibration error of the strong model. These theoretical bounds reveal two critical insights: (1) the weak model should demonstrate strong generalization performance and maintain well-calibrated predictions, and (2) the strong model's training process must strike a careful balance, as excessive optimization could undermine its generalization capability by over-relying on the weak supervision signals. Finally, in the regression setting, we extend the work of Charikar et al. (2024) to a loss function based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, offering guarantees that the strong student can outperform its weak teacher by at least the magnitude of their disagreement. We conduct sufficient experiments to validate our theory.</description>

      <title>Metastable Dynamics of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Provable Benefits of Search, RL and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is to allocate more inference-time compute to search against a verifier or reward model. This process can then be utilized to refine the pretrained model or distill its reasoning patterns into more efficient models. In this paper, we study inference-time compute by viewing chain-of-thought (CoT) generation as a metastable Markov process: easy reasoning steps (e.g., algebraic manipulations) form densely connected clusters, while hard reasoning steps (e.g., applying a relevant theorem) create sparse, low-probability edges between clusters, leading to phase transitions at longer timescales. Under this framework, we prove that implementing a search protocol that rewards sparse edges improves CoT by decreasing the expected number of steps to reach different clusters. In contrast, we establish a limit on reasoning capability when the model is restricted to local information of the pretrained graph. We also show that the information gained by search can be utilized to obtain a better reasoning model: (1) the pretrained model can be directly finetuned to favor sparse edges via policy gradient methods, and moreover (2) a compressed metastable representation of the reasoning dynamics can be distilled into a smaller, more efficient model.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Under Density Shift in Incremental Settings Using Cram\'er-Rao-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous surge in data volume and velocity is often dealt with using data orchestration and distributed processing approaches, abstracting away the machine learning challenges that exist at the algorithmic level. With growing interest in automating the learning loop, training with data that arrive in a sequence rather than in the classical in-memory training data form will face a machine learning challenge because of evolving feature distributions across batches of training data biasing the cross-validation step (\cite{sugiyama2012machine}). This work takes a distributed density estimation angle to the problem where data are temporally distributed. It processes data in batches and allows a neural network to treat a batch as training data. The method accumulates knowledge about the data density via posterior probability absorption using the Fisher Information Matrix, which contains information about the local optimization gradients for the batch. This is then used as a regularizer for the loss in the following batch, and therefore the density estimate for the entire dataset constructively gets more robust to the non-iid distribution shift. This needs the presence of a pair of batches in memory at a time, so the space cost is not a function of the size of the complete, distributed dataset. We proposed a novel regularization-based approach Covariate Shift Correction $C^{2}A$ that leverages Fisher information and Kullback-Leibler divergence to adapt to both natural and sequential covariate shift caused by dataset fragmentation. $C^{2}A$ achieves $19\%$ accuracy at maximum against state-of-the-art methods.</description>
