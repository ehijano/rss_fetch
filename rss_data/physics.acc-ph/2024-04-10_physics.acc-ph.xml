      <title>IsoDAR@Yemilab: Preliminary Design Report -- Volume I: Cyclotron Driver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Preliminary Design Report (PDR) describes the IsoDAR electron-antineutrino source. Volumes I and II are site-independent and describe the cyclotron driver providing a 10~mA proton beam, and the medium energy beam transport line and target, respectively. Volume III describes the installation at the Yemilab underground laboratory in South Korea. The IsoDAR driver and target will produce a mole of electron-antineutrinos over the course of five years. Paired with a kton-scale liquid scintillator detector, it will enable an impressive particle physics program including searches for new symmetries, new interactions and new particles. Here in Volume I, we describe the driver, which includes the ion source, low energy beam transport, and cyclotron. The latter features radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) direct axial injection and represents the first accelerator purpose-built to make use of vortex motion.</description>

      <title>Compensating slice emittance growth in high brightness photoinjectors using sacrificial charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving maximum electron beam brightness in photoinjectors requires detailed control of the 3D bunch shape and precise tuning of the beam focusing. Even in state-of-the-art designs, slice emittance growth due to nonlinear space charge forces and partial nonlaminarity often remains non-negligible. In this work we introduce a new means to linearize the transverse slice phase space: a sacrificial portion of the bunch's own charge distribution, formed into a wavebroken shock front by highly nonlinear space charge forces within the gun, whose downstream purpose is to dynamically linearize the desired bunch core. We show that linearization of an appropriately prepared bunch can be achieved via strongly nonlaminar focusing of the sacrificial shock front, while the inner core focuses laminarly. This leads to a natural spatial separation of the two distributions: a dense core surrounded by a diffuse halo of sacrificial charge that can be collimated. Multi-objective genetic algorithm optimizations of the ultra-compact x-ray free electron laser (UCXFEL) injector employ this concept, and we interpret it with an analytic model that agrees well with the simulations. In simulation we demonstrate a final bunch charge of 100 pC, peak current $\sim 30$ A, and a sacrificial charge of 150 pC (250 pC total emitted from cathode) with normalized emittance growth of $&lt;20$ nm-rad due to space charge. This implies a maximum achievable brightness approximately an order of magnitude greater than existing FEL injector designs.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of second sound quench detection for superconducting cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting RF cavities are used in particle accelerators to provide energy to the particle beam. Such cavities are mostly fabricated in niobium and often operated in superfluid helium. One of their limits of operation is the appearance of a local quench, initiated by a local field enhancement due to a defect, which leads to a normal conducting transition of the cavity. Localizing the quench area can be achieved with temperature mapping systems. Another method is the use of second sound wave propagation in superfluid helium. Measuring the time of propagation of these waves from quench location to special sensors, called Oscillating Superleak Transducers (OSTs), and using their well-known velocity should allow trilateration. However, most of experimental measurements on cavities show "premature signals", i.e. the second sound signals arrive earlier on the OSTs than expected. This paper presents several quench experiments on cavities equipped with OSTs and temperature mapping quench detection systems. Two hypotheses can explain the observed premature signals. The first one assesses faster propagation in helium. An experimental setup has been developed for testing this hypothesis, where second sound is created by a localized heater in a controlled environment up to 4.3 kW/cm2 and 2.8 J. Premature signals could not be verified in this setup. A second hypothesis based on a simple model including several processes in niobium and second sound propagation in helium is discussed. The model improves significantly the prediction of the times of arrival of the second sound waves. The overall study shows that the processes in niobium play a prominent role in the second sound detection for superconducting cavities.</description>

      <title>The problem of self-consistent particle phase space distributions for periodic focusing channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged particle beams that remain stationary while passing through a transport channel are represented by ``self-consistent'' phase space distributions. As the starting point, we assume the external focusing forces to act continuously on the beam. If Liouville's theorem applies, an infinite variety of self-consistent particle phase space distributions exists then. The method is reviewed how to determine the Hamiltonian of the focusing system for a given phase space density function. Subsequently, this Hamiltonian is transformed canonically to yield the appropriate Hamiltonian that pertains to a beam passing through a non-continuous transport system. It is shown that the total transverse beam energy is a conserved quantity, if the beam stays rotationally symmetric along the channel. It can be concluded that charged particle beams can be transmitted through periodic solenoid channels without loss of quality. Our computer simulations, presented in the second part of the paper, confirm this result. In contrast, the simulation for a periodic quadrupole channel yields a small but constant growth rate of the rms-emittance.</description>

      <title>On the stability and emittance growth of different particle phase-space distributions in a long magnetic quadrupole channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of K-V, waterbag, parabolic, conical and Gaussian distributions in periodic quadrupole channels is studied by particle simulations. It is found that all these different distributions exhibit the known K-V instabilities. But the action of the K-V type modes becomes more and more damped in the order of the types of distributions quoted above. This damping is so strong for the Gaussian distribution that the emittance growth factor after a large number of periods is considerably lower than in the case of an equivalent K-V distribution. In addition, the non K-V distributions experience in only one period of the channel a rapid initial emittance growth, which becomes very significant at high beam intensities. This growth is attributed to the homogenization of the space-charge density, resulting in a conversion of electric-field energy into transverse kinetic and potential energy. Two simple analytical formulae are derived to estimate the upper and lower boundary values for this effect and are compared with the results obtained from particle simulations.</description>
