      <title>Jumping on the bandwagon and off the Titanic: an experimental study of turnout in two-tier voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study voter turnout in two-tier elections when the electorate consists of multiple groups, such as states. Votes are aggregated within the groups by the winner-take-all rule or the proportional rule, and the group-level decisions are combined to determine the winner. We observe that, compared with the theoretical prediction, turnout is significantly lower in the minority camp (the Titanic effect) and significantly higher in the majority camp (the behavioral bandwagon effect), and these effects are stronger under the proportional rule than under the winner-take-all rule. As a result, the distribution of voter welfare becomes more unequal than theoretically predicted, and this welfare effect is stronger under the proportional rule than under the winner-take-all rule.</description>

      <title>Hydrological collapse in southern Spain under expanding irrigated agriculture: Meteorological, hydrological, and structural drought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spain is the largest producer of avocado and mango fruits in Europe. The majority of production is concentrated in the Axarqu\'ia region in the south, where subtropical fruit plantations and associated water demands have steadily increased over the last two decades. Between 2019-2024, the region underwent an extreme water crisis. Reservoir reserves became nearly depleted and groundwater levels dropped to sea level in several locations, where seawater intrusion is likely, causing large socioeconomic impacts including short-term harvest losses and a long-term loss in economic centrality. We examine the causal pathway that led to this crisis using a mixed-methods approach, combining data from key informant interviews, an exhaustive review of legal documents, and quantitative analysis of time series and spatially explicit data. In particular, we analyze dam water use for irrigation and urban use, meteorological data, reservoir and groundwater levels, and irrigation land cover maps. Our findings show that an unusual meteorological drought was the immediate cause for the decline in reservoir and groundwater reserves (hydrological drought), but the underlying cause was a chronic and structural long-term imbalance between water demand and resources resulting from several structural governance shortcomings: large uncertainties in water resource availability and use hampering effective planning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and the absence of regulatory mechanisms to flexibly impose resource use restrictions at both micro and macro levels based on the overall resources of the system. We propose concrete policy interventions aimed at sustainably enhancing the resilience of the system that can be useful to efficiently manage water shortages in other regions with similar problems.</description>

      <title>Spatial Weather, Socio-Economic and Political Risks in Probabilistic Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasts of the impact of spatial weather and pan-European socio-economic and political risks on hourly electricity demand for the mid-term horizon are crucial for strategic decision-making amidst the inherent uncertainty. Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the operational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary challenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted drivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual, and holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive effects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political effects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity. To address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term forecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic effects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational dependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled socio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting. Built from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables an analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the hour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries reliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European electricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric heating adoption.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Dunkelflaute: How (not) to analyze variable renewable energy shortage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As variable renewable energy sources increasingly gain importance in global energy systems, there is a growing interest in understanding periods of variable renewable energy shortage ("Dunkelflauten"). Defining, quantifying, and comparing such shortage events across different renewable generation technologies and locations presents a surprisingly intricate challenge. Various methodological approaches exist in different bodies of literature, which have been applied to single technologies in specific locations or technology portfolios across multiple regions. We provide an overview of various methods for quantifying variable renewable energy shortage, focusing either on supply from variable renewables or its mismatch with electricity demand. We explain and critically discuss the merits and challenges of different approaches for defining and identifying shortage events and propose further methodological improvements for more accurate shortage determination. Additionally, we elaborate on comparability requirements for multi-technological and multi-regional energy shortage analysis. In doing so, we aim to contribute to unifying disparate methodologies, harmonizing terminologies, and providing guidance for future research.</description>
