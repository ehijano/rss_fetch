      <title>Constrained and Regularized Quantitative Ultrasound Parameter Estimation using ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularized estimation of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters, such as attenuation and backscatter coefficients, has gained research interest. Recently, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been applied successfully to estimate these parameters, by utilizing L2 and L1 norms for attenuation and backscatter coefficient regularization, respectively. While this method improves upon previous approaches, it does not fully leverage the prior knowledge of minimum physically feasible parameter values, sometimes yielding values outside the realistic range. This work addresses this limitation by incorporating minimum QUS parameter values as constraints to enhance ADMM estimation. The proposed method is validated using experimental phantom data.</description>

      <title>PhaseMO: Future-Proof, Energy-efficient, Adaptive Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of devices and increasing data traffic in cellular networks necessitate advanced solutions to meet these escalating demands. Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology offers a promising approach, significantly enhancing throughput, coverage, and spatial multi-plexing. Despite its advantages, massive MIMO systems often lack flexible software controls over hardware, limiting their ability to optimize operational expenditure (OpEx) by reducing power consumption while maintaining performance. Current software-controlled methods, such as antenna muting combined with digital beamforming and hybrid beamforming, have notable limitations. Antenna muting struggles to maintain throughput and coverage, while hybrid beamforming faces hardware constraints that restrict scalability and future-proofing. This work presents PhaseMO, a versatile approach that adapts to varying network loads. PhaseMO effectively reduces power consumption in low-load scenarios without sacrificing coverage and overcomes the hardware limitations of hybrid beamforming, offering a scalable and future-proof solution. We will show that PhaseMO can achieve up to 30% improvement in energy efficiency while avoiding about 10% coverage reduction and 5dB increase in UE transmit power.</description>

      <title>A Support Vector Approach in Segmented Regression for Map-assisted Non-cooperative Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a non-cooperative source localization approach based on received signal strength (RSS) and 2D environment map, considering both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. Conventional localization methods, e.g., weighted centroid localization (WCL), may perform bad. This paper proposes a segmented regression approach using 2D maps to estimate source location and propagation environment jointly. By leveraging topological information from the 2D maps, a support vector-assisted algorithm is developed to solve the segmented regression problem, separate the LOS and NLOS measurements, and estimate the location of source. The proposed method demonstrates a good localization performance with an improvement of over 30% in localization rooted mean squared error (RMSE) compared to the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>FSC-loss: A Frequency-domain Structure Consistency Learning Approach for Signal Data Recovery and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core challenge for signal data recovery is to model the distribution of signal matrix (SM) data based on measured low-quality data in biomedical engineering of magnetic particle imaging (MPI). For acquiring the high-resolution (high-quality) SM, the number of meticulous measurements at numerous positions in the field-of-view proves time-consuming (measurement of a 37x37x37 SM takes about 32 hours). To improve reconstructed signal quality and shorten SM measurement time, existing methods explore to generating high-resolution SM based on time-saving measured low-resolution SM (a 9x9x9 SM just takes about 0.5 hours). However, previous methods show poor performance for high-frequency signal recovery in SM. To achieve a high-resolution SM recovery and shorten its acquisition time, we propose a frequency-domain structure consistency loss function and data component embedding strategy to model global and local structural information of SM. We adopt a transformer-based network to evaluate this function and the strategy. We evaluate our methods and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the two simulation datasets and four public measured SMs in Open MPI Data. The results show that our method outperforms the SOTA methods in high-frequency structural signal recovery. Additionally, our method can recover a high-resolution SM with clear high-frequency structure based on a down-sampling factor of 16 less than 15 seconds, which accelerates the acquisition time over 60 times faster than the measurement-based HR SM with the minimum error (nRMSE=0.041). Moreover, our method is applied in our three in-house MPI systems, and boost their performance for signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Rotatable and Movable Antenna-Enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication networks. As the demand for communication performance significantly increases, extremely large-scale antenna arrays and tremendously high-frequency bands get widely applied in communication systems, leading to the expansion of the near-field region. On a parallel track, movable antennas (MAs) and six-dimensional MAs (6DMAs) are proposed as emerging technologies to improve the performance of communication and sensing. Based on such a background, this paper investigates the performance of ISAC systems in the near-field region, focusing on a novel system architecture that employs rotatable MAs (RMAs). Additionally, a spherical wave near-field channel model with respect to RMAs' rotations and positions is derived by considering the effective aperture loss. Two designs are explored: a sensing-centric design that minimizes the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and a communication-centric design that maximizes the sum-rate with a CRB constraint. To solve the formulated optimization problems, the paper proposes two alternating optimization (AO) based algorithms composed of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the superiority of the proposed setups for both sensing and communication performance compared to traditional fixed antenna systems, highlighting the potential of RMAs to enhance ISAC systems in near-field scenarios.</description>

      <title>Recursive Least Squares with Fading Regularization for Finite-Time Convergence without Persistent Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends recursive least squares (RLS) to include time-varying regularization. This extension provides flexibility for updating the least squares regularization term in real time. Existing results with constant regularization imply that the parameter-estimation error dynamics of RLS are globally attractive to zero if and only the regressor is weakly persistently exciting. This work shows that, by extending classical RLS to include a time-varying (fading) regularization term that converges to zero, the parameter-estimation error dynamics are globally attractive to zero without weakly persistent excitation. Moreover, if the fading regularization term converges to zero in finite time, then the parameter estimation error also converges to zero in finite time. Finally, we propose rank-1 fading regularization (R1FR) RLS, a time-varying regularization algorithm with fading regularization that converges to zero, and which runs in the same computational complexity as classical RLS. Numerical examples are presented to validate theoretical guarantees and to show how R1FR-RLS can protect against over-regularization.</description>

      <title>Multiple testing in multi-stream sequential change detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-stream sequential change detection involves simultaneously monitoring many streams of data and trying to detect when their distributions change, if at all. Here, we theoretically study multiple testing issues that arise from detecting changes in many streams. We point out that any algorithm with finite average run length (ARL) must have a trivial worst-case false detection rate (FDR), family-wise error rate (FWER), and per-family error rate (PFER); thus, any attempt to control these Type I error metrics is fundamentally in conflict with the desire for a finite ARL. One of our contributions is to define a new class of metrics which can be controlled, called error over patience (EOP). We propose algorithms that combine the recent e-detector framework (which generalizes the Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM methods) with the recent e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and e-Bonferroni procedures. We prove that these algorithms control the EOP at any desired level under very general dependence structures on the data within and across the streams. In fact, we prove a more general error control that holds uniformly over all stopping times and provides a smooth trade-off between the conflicting metrics. Additionally, if finiteness of the ARL is forfeited, we show that our algorithms control the Type I error.</description>

      <title>Holographic Metasurface-Based Beamforming for Multi-Altitude LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are capable of improving the global Internet service coverage. In this context, we propose a hybrid beamforming design for holographic metasurface based terrestrial users in multi-altitude LEO satellite networks. Firstly, the holographic beamformer is optimized by maximizing the downlink channel gain from the serving satellite to the terrestrial user. Then, the digital beamformer is designed by conceiving a minimum mean square error (MMSE) based detection algorithm for mitigating the interference arriving from other satellites. To dispense with excessive overhead of full channel state information (CSI) acquisition of all satellites, we propose a low-complexity MMSE beamforming algorithm that only relies on the distribution of the LEO satellite constellation harnessing stochastic geometry, which can achieve comparable throughput to that of the algorithm based on the full CSI in the case of a dense LEO satellite deployment. Furthermore, it outperforms the maximum ratio combining (MRC) algorithm, thanks to its inter-satellite interference mitigation capacity. The simulation results show that our proposed holographic metasurface based hybrid beamforming architecture is capable of outperforming the state-of-the-art antenna array architecture in terms of its throughput, given the same physical size of the transceivers. Moreover, we demonstrate that the beamforming performance attained can be substantially improved by taking into account the mutual coupling effect, imposed by the dense placement of the holographic metasurface elements.</description>

      <title>Target Tracking Using the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter with Numerical Differentiation for Estimating Curvature and Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of target tracking is to estimate target position, velocity, and acceleration in real time using position data. This paper introduces a novel target-tracking technique that uses adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) for real-time numerical differentiation to estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk from position data. These estimates are used to model the target motion within the Frenet-Serret (FS) frame. By representing the model in SE(3), the position and velocity are estimated using the invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF). The proposed method, called FS-IEKF-AISE, is illustrated by numerical examples and compared to prior techniques.</description>

      <title>KN-LIO: Geometric Kinematics and Neural Field Coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) have boosted a large amount of applications. However, traditional LIO systems tend to focus more on localization rather than mapping, with maps consisting mostly of sparse geometric elements, which is not ideal for downstream tasks. Recent emerging neural field technology has great potential in dense mapping, but pure LiDAR mapping is difficult to work on high-dynamic vehicles. To mitigate this challenge, we present a new solution that tightly couples geometric kinematics with neural fields to enhance simultaneous state estimation and dense mapping capabilities. We propose both semi-coupled and tightly coupled Kinematic-Neural LIO (KN-LIO) systems that leverage online SDF decoding and iterated error-state Kalman filtering to fuse laser and inertial data. Our KN-LIO minimizes information loss and improves accuracy in state estimation, while also accommodating asynchronous multi-LiDAR inputs. Evaluations on diverse high-dynamic datasets demonstrate that our KN-LIO achieves performance on par with or superior to existing state-of-the-art solutions in pose estimation and offers improved dense mapping accuracy over pure LiDAR-based methods. The relevant code and datasets will be made available at https://**.</description>

      <title>Frenet-Serret-Based Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a crucial element of guidance, navigation, and control systems. This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!</description>

      <title>Unlocking the diagnostic potential of electrocardiograms through information transfer from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) can be diagnosed using various diagnostic modalities. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective and widely available diagnostic aid that provides functional information of the heart. However, its ability to classify and spatially localise CVD is limited. In contrast, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides detailed structural information of the heart and thus enables evidence-based diagnosis of CVD, but long scan times and high costs limit its use in clinical routine. In this work, we present a deep learning strategy for cost-effective and comprehensive cardiac screening solely from ECG. Our approach combines multimodal contrastive learning with masked data modelling to transfer domain-specific information from CMR imaging to ECG representations. In extensive experiments using data from 40,044 UK Biobank subjects, we demonstrate the utility and generalisability of our method for subject-specific risk prediction of CVD and the prediction of cardiac phenotypes using only ECG data. Specifically, our novel multimodal pre-training paradigm improves performance by up to 12.19 % for risk prediction and 27.59 % for phenotype prediction. In a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that our learned ECG representations incorporate information from CMR image regions of interest. Our entire pipeline is publicly available at https://github.com/oetu/MMCL-ECG-CMR.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dual-Blind Deconvolution for Joint Radar-Communication Systems Using ADMM: Enhancing Channel Estimation and Signal Recovery in 5G mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for jointly estimating unknown radar channels and transmit signals in millimeter-wave (mmWave) Joint Radar-Communication (JRC) systems, a problem often referred to as dual-blind deconvolution. The proposed method employs the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to iteratively refine the radar channel G (or H) and the transmitted signal X under convex constraints, incorporating both smooth and non-smooth penalty terms via proximal operators. By enforcing a bounded perturbation model for the radar channel and a strict transmit power budget, the algorithm aligns well with practical hardware limits. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach reliably addresses the dual-blind deconvolution challenge, resulting in effective radar channel estimation and robust communication performance. Notably, the framework's iterative structure readily accommodates hardware considerations and different system configurations, making it well-suited for emerging mmWave JRC scenarios. Its adaptability and computational efficiency highlight the potential for wider adoption in next-generation wireless networks, where radar detection and communications increasingly share bandwidth and hardware resources.</description>

      <title>A Peaceman-Rachford Splitting Approach with Deep Equilibrium Network for Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is pivotal for wireless systems, yet its high-dimensional, stochastic channel poses significant challenges for accurate estimation, highlighting the critical need for robust estimation techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel channel estimation method for the MIMO system. The main idea is to construct a fixed-point equation for channel estimation, which can be implemented into the deep equilibrium (DEQ) model with a fixed network. Specifically, the Peaceman-Rachford (PR) splitting method is applied to the dual form of the regularized minimization problem to construct fixed-point equation with non-expansive property. Then, the fixed-point equation is implemented into the DEQ model with a fixed layer, leveraging its advantage of the low training complexity. Moreover, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrating the convergence and optimality of our approach. Additionally, simulations of hybrid far- and near-field channels demonstrate that our approach yields favorable results, indicating its ability to advance channel estimation in MIMO system.</description>

      <title>Improved Estimation Accuracy in OFDM-based Joint Communication and Sensing through Kalman Tracking and Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a monostatic orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system for object tracking. Our setup consists of a transmitter and receiver equipped with an antenna array for fully digital beamforming. The native resolution of all radar-like sensing, including OFDM radar sensing, is limited by the observation time and bandwidth. In this work, we improve the parameter estimates through interpolation methods and tracking algorithms. We verify our method by comparing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimated range, velocity and angle and by comparing the mean Euclidean distance between the estimated and true position. We demonstrate how both a Kalman filter for tracking, and interpolation methods using zero-padding and the chirp Z-transform (CZT) improve the estimation error. We discuss the computational complexity of the different methods. We propose the KalmanCZT approach that combines tracking via Kalman filtering and interpolation via the CZT, resulting in a solution with flexible resolution that significantly improves the range RMSE.</description>

      <title>EOM Minimum Point Bias Voltage Estimation for Application in Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum computing systems the quantum states of qubits can be modified among others by applying light pulses. In order to achieve low computing error rates these pulses have to be precisely shaped in magnitude and phase. In practical applications, both acousto-optic (AOM) and electro-optic modulators (EOM) are used for this purpose. The advantages of EOMs, in particular Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs), include e.g. higher bandwidth, compactness, good integrability and better noise performance. On the other hand, EOMs are challenging regarding their control voltage regulation as they experience a bias drift, i.e. voltage shifts in the modulator's operating point. Such a shift significantly impairs the quality of the modulation, which is why EOMs usually require a bias control loop to track the DC operating point. This work addresses the estimation of the instantaneous bias voltage using a small pilot tone, where the optical output power of the EOM is tracked by a photodetector feedback signal.</description>

      <title>Time Difference of Arrival Source Localization: Exact Linear Solutions for the General 3D Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time difference of arrival (TDOA) problem admits exact, purely algebraic solutions for the situation in which there are 4 and 5 sensors and a single source whose position is to be determined in 3 dimensions. The solutions are exact in the sense that there is no least squares operation (i.e., projection) involved in the solution. The solutions involve no linearization or iteration, and are algebraically transparent via vector algebra in Cartesian coordinates. The solution with 5 sensors requires no resolution of sign ambiguities; the solution with 4 sensors requires resolution of one sign ambiguity. Solutions are effected using only TDOA and not, e.g., frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) or angle of arrival (AOA).
  We first present the 5-sensor solution and then follow with the 4-sensor scenario. Numerical experiments are presented showing the performance of the calculations in the case of no noise, before closing with conclusions. Performance of the calculations is exact within numerical error, and in the small fraction of cases in which source localization does not occur, it is driven by misidentification in resolution of sign ambiguity without priors. We therefore believe the calculations have substantial practical utility for their speed and exactness.</description>

      <title>Manifold Filter-Combine Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04056v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to better understand manifold neural networks (MNNs), we introduce Manifold Filter-Combine Networks (MFCNs). Our filter-combine framework parallels the popular aggregate-combine paradigm for graph neural networks (GNNs) and naturally suggests many interesting families of MNNs which can be interpreted as manifold analogues of various popular GNNs. We propose a method for implementing MFCNs on high-dimensional point clouds that relies on approximating an underlying manifold by a sparse graph. We then prove that our method is consistent in the sense that it converges to a continuum limit as the number of data points tends to infinity, and we numerically demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world and synthetic data sets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization With Across-Task Transferable Max-Value Entropy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many applications, ranging from logistics to engineering, a designer is faced with a sequence of optimization tasks for which the objectives are in the form of black-box functions that are costly to evaluate. Furthermore, higher-fidelity evaluations of the optimization objectives often entail a larger cost. Existing multi-fidelity black-box optimization strategies select candidate solutions and fidelity levels with the goal of maximizing the information about the optimal value or the optimal solution for the current task. Assuming that successive optimization tasks are related, this paper introduces a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that balances the need to acquire information about the current task with the goal of collecting information transferable to future tasks. The proposed method transfers across tasks distributions over parameters of a Gaussian process surrogate model by implementing particle-based variational Bayesian updates. Theoretical insights based on the analysis of the expected regret substantiate the benefits of acquiring transferable knowledge across tasks. Furthermore, experimental results across synthetic and real-world examples reveal that the proposed acquisition strategy that caters to future tasks can significantly improve the optimization efficiency as soon as a sufficient number of tasks is processed.</description>

      <title>A Soft Sensor Method with Uncertainty-Awareness and Self-Explanation Based on Large Language Models Enhanced by Domain Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven soft sensors are crucial in predicting key performance indicators in industrial systems. However, current methods predominantly rely on the supervised learning paradigms of parameter updating, which inherently faces challenges such as high development costs, poor robustness, training instability, and lack of interpretability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, notably through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables high-performance task execution with minimal input-label demonstrations and no prior training. This paper aims to replace supervised learning with the emerging ICL paradigm for soft sensor modeling to address existing challenges and explore new avenues for advancement. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Few-shot Uncertainty-aware and self-Explaining Soft Sensor (LLM-FUESS), which includes the Zero-shot Auxiliary Variable Selector (LLM-ZAVS) and the Uncertainty-aware Few-shot Soft Sensor (LLM-UFSS). The LLM-ZAVS retrieves from the Industrial Knowledge Vector Storage to enhance LLMs' domain-specific knowledge, enabling zero-shot auxiliary variable selection. In the LLM-UFSS, we utilize text-based context demonstrations of structured data to prompt LLMs to execute ICL for predicting and propose a context sample retrieval augmentation strategy to improve performance. Additionally, we explored LLMs' AIGC and probabilistic characteristics to propose self-explanation and uncertainty quantification methods for constructing a trustworthy soft sensor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, strong robustness, and flexibility, effectively mitigates training instability found in traditional methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish soft sensor utilizing LLMs.</description>
