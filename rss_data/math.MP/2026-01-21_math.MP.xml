      <title>Existence of Decreasing Nambu Solutions to the Rainbow Ladder Gap Equation of QCD by Cone Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying Nambu solutions of the rainbow-ladder gap equation in QCD at zero temperature and chemical potential, we prove that the mass function emerges continuously from zero as the interaction strength is increased past the critical point for all positive, asymptotically perturbative kernels almost everywhere continuous in $L^1$ using the Krasnosel'skii-Guo Cone Compression Theorem. We prove that the coupled system of equations must have a positive, continuous Nambu solution with decreasing mass function for all current quark masses for a class of models which includes the physical point of a popular model of QCD by using a hybrid Krasnosel'skii-Schauder Fixed Point Theorem.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall States: Infinite Matrix Product Representation and its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel matrix product representation of the Laughlin and related fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions based on a rigorous version of the correlators of a chiral quantum field theory. This representation enables the quantitative control of the coefficients of the Laughlin wavefunction times an arbitrary monomial symmetric polynomial when expanded in a Slater determinant or permanent basis. It renders the properties, such as factorization and the renewal structure, inherent in such fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions transparent. We prove bounds on the correlators of the chiral quantum field theory and utilize this representation to demonstrate the exponential decay of connected correlations and a gap in the entanglement spectrum on a thin cylinder.</description>

      <title>Non-intersecting Squared Bessel Process: Spectral Moments and Dynamical Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical ensembles of reduced density matrices of bipartite quantum systems play a central role in entanglement estimation, but do not capture the non-stationary nature of entanglement relevant to realistic quantum information processing. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamical extension of the Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble, a baseline statistical model for entanglement estimation, arising from non-intersecting squared Bessel processes and perform entanglement estimation via average entanglement entropy and quantum purity. The investigation is enabled by finding spectral moments of the proposed dynamical ensemble, which serves as a new approach for systematic computation of entanglement metrics. Along the way, we also obtain new results for the underlying multiple orthogonal polynomials of modified Bessel weights, including structure and recurrence relations, and a Christoffel-Darboux formula for the correlation kernels.</description>

      <title>Heun-function analysis of the Dirac spinor spectrum in a sine-Gordon soliton background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dirac spectrum in a sine-Gordon soliton background, where the induced position-dependent mass reduces the spectral problem to a Heun-type differential equation. Bound and scattering sectors are treated within a unified framework, with spectral data encoded in Wronskians matching local Heun solutions and exhibiting explicit dependence on the soliton parameters and the bare fermion mass. This formulation enables a systematic analysis of spinor bound and scattering states, supported by analytic and numerical verification of wave function matching across the soliton domain. The present work is related to arXiv:2512.07658 and emphasizes a pedagogical treatment of scattering states within the Heun-equation formalism.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Hamiltonian as an emergent structure from information geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the relativistic energy-momentum relation can emerge as an effective ensemble-averaged structure from a multiplicative Hamiltonian when fluctuations of an auxiliary parameter are treated using maximum entropy inference. The resulting probability distribution is uniquely fixed by scale-invariant constraints, which are shown to arise naturally from the Fisher-Rao geometry of the associated statistical manifold. Within this information-geometric framework, the relativistic dispersion relation appears without initially imposing Lorentz symmetry, but as a consequence of statistical averaging and geometric invariance.</description>

      <title>Countable basis for free electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polychromatic electromagnetic fields are typically expanded as integrals over monochromatic fields, such as plane waves, multipolar fields, or Bessel beams. However, monochromatic fields do not belong to the Hilbert space of free Maxwell fields, since their norms diverge. Moreover, the continuous frequency integrals involved in such expansions complicate the treatment of light--matter interactions via the scattering operator. Here, we identify and study a polychromatic basis for free Maxwell fields whose basis vectors belong to the Hilbert space. These vectors are defined as simultaneous eigenstates of four commuting operators with integer eigenvalues. As a consequence, the basis set is countable, and the Hilbert space is separable and isomorphic to $\ell^2$, the Hilbert space of square-summable sequences. Each basis vector represents a polychromatic single-photon wave with quantized energy and a wavelet--like temporal dependence. Three versions of this basis are defined: Regular, incoming, and outgoing. The fields of the regular basis are smooth in both space and time. The incoming and outgoing fields are likewise smooth, except at the spatial origin. These results support and motivate the use of countable bases for both the theoretical description and the practical computation of light--matter interactions.</description>

      <title>The Reduced Phase Space of $N=1, D=4$ Supergravity in the BV-BFV formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the reduced phase space of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in the fully off-shell Palatini--Cartan formalism. This is achieved through the KT construction, allowing an explicit description of first-class constraints on the boundary. The corresponding BFV description is obtained, and its relation with the BV one in the bulk is described by employing the BV pushforward in the particular example of a cylindrical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Covariant tomography of fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Inverse Boundary Value Problem (IBVP) for classical fields, specifically focusing on the recovery of parallelly transformed fields within a region based on known boundary data. We introduce a local solution framework, termed "covariant tomography," that uses geometric decomposition to reconstruct interior fields and currents within star-shaped open subsets. The core of our approach involves decomposing differential forms into exact and antiexact components, enabling the formulation of the parallel transport equation via a homotopy operator. We examine three primary extension techniques - radial, heat equation, and harmonic - to map boundary values into the interior, noting that the choice of extension directly influences the regularity of the resulting currents. The proposed methodology provides a systematic way to identify the realizability of boundary values and offers solutions for both current and gauge field tomography. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this framework through illustrative examples in low-dimensional spaces and electromagnetic potential reconstruction in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.</description>

      <title>A note on "Higher order linear differential equations for unitary matrix integrals: applications and generalisations"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we briefly introduce the background and motivation of the collaborative work [arXiv:2508.20797], and provide an outline of the main results. The latter relates to matrix and higher order scalar differential equations satisfied by certain Hankel and Toeplitz determinants involving I-Bessel functions, or equivalently certain unitary matrix integrals, and moreover puts this property in a broader context. We also investigate large gaps between zeros of the derivatives of the Hardy $\mathsf{Z}$-function, assuming the validity of a certain joint moments conjecture in random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>The spectral measures of random Jacobi matrices related to beta ensembles at high temperature and Dirichlet processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a high temperature regime where $\beta N \to 2c$, the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of Gaussian beta ensembles, beta Laguerre ensembles and beta Jacobi ensembles converges to a limiting measure which is related to associated Hermite polynomials, associated Laguerre polynomials and associated Jacobi polynomials, respectively. Here $\beta$ is the inverse temperature parameter, $N$ is the system size and $c&gt;0$ is a given constant. This paper studies the spectral measure of the random tridiagonal matrix model of the three classical beta ensembles. We show that in the high temperature regime, the spectral measure converges in distribution to a Dirichlet process with base distribution being the limiting distribution, and scaling parameter $c$. Consequently, the spectral measure of a related semi-infinite Jacobi matrix coincides with that Dirichlet process, which provides examples of random Jacobi matrices with explicit spectral measures.</description>

      <title>Some Consequences of the Grunewald-O'Halloran Conjecture for Pseudoquonic Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating a recent positive solution of a conjecture of Grunewald and O'Halloran for complex finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras, we are in the position to find results of existence and uniqueness for the construction of complex nilpotent Lie algebras of arbitrary dimension via pseudobosonic operators. We involve the so-called theory of the deformation of Lie algebras of Gerstenhaber, in order to prove our main results. There isn't a generalized version of the Grunewald-O'Halloran Conjecture when we consider pseudoquonic operators, which specialize to pseudobosonic operators in many cirumstances. Therefore we prove a result of existence (and a direct construction) of pseudobosonic $O^*$-algebras of operators, but leave open the problem of the uniqueness of the construction.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian hydrodynamic reductions of one-dimensional Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Hamiltonian fluid reductions of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our approach utilizes the hydrodynamic Poisson bracket framework, which allows us to systematically identify fundamental normal variables derived from the analysis of the Casimir invariants of the resulting Poisson bracket. This framework is then applied to analyze several well-established Hamiltonian closures of the onedimensional Vlasov equation, including the multi-delta distribution and the waterbag models. Our key finding is that all of these seemingly distinct closures consistently lead to the formulation of a unified form of parametric closures: When expressed in terms of the identified normal variables, the parameterization across all these closures is revealed to be polynomial and of the same degree. All these parametric closures are uniquely generated from one of the moments, called $\mu$2, a cubic polynomial in the normal variables. This result establishes a structural connection between these different physical models, offering a path toward a more unified and simplified description of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson dynamics through its reduced hydrodynamic forms with an arbitrary number of fluid variables.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Constraints from SU(2) Representation Theory in Graph-Based Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dimensional constraints arising from representation theory when abstract graph edges possess internal degrees of freedom but lack geometric properties. We prove that such internal degrees of freedom can only encode directional information, necessitating quantum states in $\mathbb{C}^2$ (qubits) as the minimal representation. Any geometrically consistent projection of these states maps necessarily to $\mathbb{R}^3$ via the Bloch sphere. This dimensional constraint $d=3$ emerges through self-consistency: edges without intrinsic geometry force directional encoding ($\mathbb{C}^2$), whose natural symmetry group $SU(2)$ has three-dimensional Lie algebra, yielding emergent geometry that validates the hypothesis via Bloch sphere correspondence ($S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$). We establish uniqueness (SU($N&gt;2$) yields $d&gt;3$) and robustness (dimensional saturation under graph topology changes). The Euclidean metric emerges canonically from the Killing form on $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. A global gauge consistency axiom is justified via principal bundle trivialization for finite graphs. Numerical simulations verify theoretical predictions. This result demonstrates how dimensional structure can be derived from information-theoretic constraints, with potential relevance to quantum information theory, discrete geometry, and quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Phase Transitions in Random Non-Commutative Geometries and Related Random-Matrix Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles of random fuzzy non-commutative geometries
  may be described in terms of finite (\(N^2\)-dimensional)
  Dirac operators and a probability measure.
  Dirac operators of type \((p,q)\) are defined in
  terms of commutators and anti-commutators of \(2^{p+q-1}\)
  hermitian matrices \(H_k\)
  and tensor products with a representation of a Clifford algebra.
  Ensembles based on this idea have recently been
  used as a toy model for
  quantum gravity,
  and they are interesting random-matrix
  ensembles in their own right.
  We provide
  a complete theoretical picture of crossovers,
  phase transitions, and symmetry breaking
  in the \(N \to \infty \) limit of
  1-parameter families of quartic Barrett-Glaser ensembles
  in the one-matrix cases \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\) that
  depend on one coupling constant \(g\).
  Our theoretical results are in full agreement with previous
  and new Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on recurrence time in closed quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of an isolated quantum system inevitably exhibits recurrence: the state returns to the vicinity of its initial condition after finite time. Despite its fundamental nature, a rigorous quantitative understanding of recurrence has been lacking. We establish upper bounds on the recurrence time, $t_{\mathrm{rec}} \lesssim t_{\mathrm{exit}}(\epsilon)(1/\epsilon)^d$, where $d$ is the Hilbert-space dimension, $\epsilon$ the neighborhood size, and $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(\epsilon)$ the escape time from this neighborhood. For pure states evolving under a Hamiltonian $H$, estimating $t_{\mathrm{exit}}$ is equivalent to an inverse quantum speed limit problem: finding upper bounds on the time a time-evolved state $\psi_t$ needs to depart from the $\epsilon$-vicinity of the initial state $\psi_0$. We provide a partial solution, showing that under mild assumptions $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(\epsilon) \approx \epsilon /\sqrt{ \Delta(H^2)}$, with $\Delta(H^2)$ the Hamiltonian variance in $\psi_0$. We show that our upper bound on $t_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is generically saturated for random Hamiltonians. Finally, we analyze the impact of coherence of the initial state in the eigenbasis of $H$ on recurrence behavior.</description>

      <title>Umbral theory and the algebra of formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Umbral theory, formulated in its modern version by S. Roman and G.~C. Rota, has been reconsidered in more recent times by G. Dattoli and collaborators with the aim of devising a working computational tool in the framework of special function theory. Concepts like umbral image and umbral vacuum have been introduced as pivotal elements of the discussion, which, albeit effective, lacks of generality.
  This article is directed towards endowing the formalism with a rigorous formulation within the context of the formal power series with complex coefficients $(\mathbb{C}[[ t ]], \partial)$. The new formulation is founded on the definition of the umbral operator $\operatorname{\mathfrak{u}}$ as a functional in the "umbral ground state" subalgebra of analytically convergent formal series $\varphi \in \mathbb{C}\{t\}$.
  We consider in detail some specific classes of umbral ground states $\varphi$ and analyse the conditions for analytic convergence of the corresponding umbral identities, defined as formal series resulting from the action on $\varphi$ of operators of the form $f(\zeta \operatorname{\mathfrak{u}}^\mu)$ with $f \in \mathbb{C}\{t\}$ and $\mu, \zeta \in \mathbb{C}$. For these umbral states, we exploit the Gevrey classification of formal power series to establish a connection with the theory of Borel-Laplace resummation, enabling to make rigorous sense of a large class of -- even divergent -- umbral identities.
  As an application of the proposed theoretical framework, we introduce and investigate the properties of new umbral images for the Gaussian trigonometric functions, which emphasise the trigonometric-like nature of these functions and enable to define the concept of "Gaussian Fourier transform", a potentially powerful tool for applications.</description>

      <title>A new class of special functions arising in plasma linear susceptibility tensor calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate some fundamental properties of a peculiar class of special functions strictly related to Bessel, Anger and Weber functions, whose introduction was originally motivated by linear susceptibility tensor calculations in a hot, magnetised plasma. We show that these functions are solutions of an inhomogeneous Bessel ODE, with specified initial conditions and a distinct right-hand-side term fulfilling the Nielsen's requirement. Beside deriving recurrence relations and an alternative representation involving incomplete Anger-Weber functions, we show that these functions admit a simple series expansion in terms of Bessel functions of integer order, obtained by resorting to the Jacobi-Anger formula. In plasma applications this eventually leads to expressions involving infinite sums of products of Bessel functions, not particularly apt to numerical evaluation ought to their slow convergence rate when the particle's gyro-radius is larger than the wavelength. By exploiting the previously determined recurrence properties of the new class of functions we present a particularly simple derivation of the linear susceptibility tensor that enables to avoid this inconvenience.</description>

      <title>Positive energy-momentum theorems for asymptotically AdS spin initial data sets with charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For complete spin initial data sets with an asymptotically anti--de Sitter end, we introduce a charged energy--momentum defined as a linear functional arising from the Einstein--Maxwell constraints. Under a dominant energy condition adapted to the presence of a negative cosmological constant, we establish positive energy--momentum theorems, showing in particular that this functional is non--negative on a natural real cone. We place particular emphasis on the case where the manifold carries a compact inner boundary. In the time--symmetric setting, this yields a mass--charge inequality for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with charge.</description>

      <title>Weyl Mutations in Quiver Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Shiraishi--Mori construction is exhaustive for ferromagnetic quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) constitute a subtle violation of ergodicity through a set of non-thermal eigenstates, referred to as scar states, which are embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum. In a broad class of known examples, these scar states admit a simple interpretation: they are magnon excitations of fixed momentum on top of a ferromagnetic background. In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states. This architecture is closely related to the Shiraishi--Mori construction, and our main theorem establishes that an appropriate generalization of that construction is in fact essentially exhaustive for this class of scar states.</description>

      <title>Phase-IDENT: Identification of Two-phase PDEs with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method, Phase-IDENT, for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from noisy observations of dynamical systems that exhibit phase transitions. Such phenomena are prevalent in fluid dynamics and materials science, where they can be modeled mathematically as functions satisfying different PDEs within distinct regions separated by phase boundaries. Our approach simultaneously identifies the underlying PDEs in each regime and accurately reconstructs the phase boundaries. Furthermore, by incorporating change point detection techniques, we provide uncertainty quantification for the detected boundaries, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of our method. We conduct numerical experiments on a variety of two-phase PDE systems under different noise levels, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Magnetic spectral inverse problems on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish positive results for two spectral inverse problems in the presence of a magnetic potential. Exploiting the principal wave trace invariants, we first show that on closed Anosov manifolds with simple length spectrum, one can recover an electric and a magnetic (up to a natural gauge) potential from the spectrum of the associated magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. This extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Ceki\'c and T.Lefeuvre (2023). Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or Steklov operator) determines at the boundary both a magnetic potential, up to gauge, and an electric potential, provided the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. Under this assumption, one can actually show that the magnetic Steklov spectrum determines the full Taylor series at the boundary of any smooth magnetic field and electric potential. As a simple consequence, in this case, both an analytic magnetic field and an analytic electric potential are uniquely determined by their Steklov spectrum.</description>

      <title>Peres-type Criterion of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering for Two Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality manifests in multipartite systems through entanglement, Bell's nonlocality, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. While Peres's positive-partial-transpose criterion provides a simple and powerful test for entanglement, a comparably elegant spectral criterion for detecting EPR steering remains an open challenge. In this work, we systematically explore whether a Peres-type criterion can be established for EPR steering in the two-qubit system. Focusing on rank-2 (including rank-1) states and the two-qubit Werner state, we analyze the eigenvalues of their partially transposed density matrices and construct a significant steering criterion based on symmetric combinations of these eigenvalues. We prove that this criterion serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for steerability for the Werner state, all two-qubit pure states, all two-qubit rank-2 states. Furthermore, we validate the criterion for higher-rank states (rank-3 and rank-4) and show that the results align with known steering inequalities. Our findings suggest a more unified framework for detecting quantum nonlocality via partial transposition and open avenues for further theoretical and numerical investigations into steering detection.</description>

      <title>Tensionless spinning string: emergence of world-sheet torsion and covariant density of energy-momentum tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The action of tensionless spinning string invariant under reparametrizions, both local supersymmetry and dilatations, is considered. The density of energy-momentum tensor is constructed and vanishing of its covariant divergence is proved. This result arises from mutual cancellation of the bosonic and fermionic contributions. Differences in the geometry of worldsheets swept by tensionless and tensionfull spinning strings are analyzed. Shown is emergence of covariant trace of a torsion tensor on w-s of the tensionless spinning string. It is derived from the condition for the fermionic scalar density to be a composite one including the 2-dim. w-s density simulating the 4-dim. Rarita-Schwinger field. The said condition is accompanied with the Noether condition for covariant divergence of the vector metric density to vanish.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum color code model on infinite lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The color code model is a crucial instance of a Calderbank--Shor--Steane (CSS)-type topological quantum error-correcting code, which notably supports transversal implementation of the full Clifford group. Its robustness against local noise is rooted in the structure of its topological excitations. From the perspective of quantum phases of matter, it is essential to understand these excitations in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we analyze the color code model on an infinite lattice within the quasi-local $C^{*}$-algebra framework, using a cone-localized Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) analysis. We classify its irreducible anyon superselection sectors and construct explicit string operators that generate anyonic excitations from the ground state. We further examine the fusion and braiding properties of these excitations. Our results show that the topological order of the color code is described by $\mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)) \simeq \mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2)) \boxtimes \mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2))$, which is equivalent to a double layer of the toric code and consistent with established analyses on finite lattices.</description>

      <title>Unbounded banded matrices with positive bidiagonal factorization and mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spectral Favard theorem is proved for semi-infinite banded matrices admitting a positive bidiagonal factorization, without assuming boundedness of the associated operator, thus covering both the bounded and unbounded settings. The result yields a matrix-valued spectral measure and an explicit spectral representation of the matrix powers in terms of the associated mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials. The argument follows the constructive truncation scheme: principal truncations are oscillatory, hence have simple positive spectra, and a suitable choice of initial conditions ensures positivity of the Christoffel coefficients and of the resulting discrete matrix-valued measures supported at the truncation eigenvalues. The main difficulty is the passage to the limit of these discrete measures beyond the bounded case. This is resolved by combining the available Gaussian quadrature structure with a Helly-type compactness argument, leading to a limiting matrix-valued measure and completing the spectral theorem. The role of normality (maximal degree pattern) for the mixed-type families is also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantum filter for a quantum open system undergoing quadrature measurements (homodyning) where the input field is in a general quasi-free state. This extends previous work for thermal input noise and allows for squeezed inputs. We introduce a convenient class of Bogoliubov transformations which we refer to as balanced and formulate the quantum stochastic model with squeezed noise as an Araki-Woods type representation. We make an essential use of the Tomita-Takesaki theory to construct the commutant of the C*-algebra describing the inputs and obtain the filtering equations using the quantum reference probability technique. The derived quantum filter must be independent of the choice of representation and this is achieved by fixing an independent quadrature in the commutant algebra.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walk, connective constant, cubic graph, Fisher transformation, quasi-transitive graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on infinite quasi-transitive cubic graphs under \emph{local transformations} that replace each degree-$3$ vertex by a finite, symmetric three-port gadget. To each gadget we associate a two-port SAW generating function $g(x)$, defined by counting SAWs that enter and exit the gadget through prescribed ports. Our first main result shows that, if $G$ is cubic and $G_1=\phi(G)$ is obtained by applying the local transformation at every vertex, then the connective constants $\mu(G)$ and $\mu(G_1)$ satisfy the functional relation \[ \mu(G)^{-1}=g\bigl(\mu(G_1)^{-1}\bigr). \] We next consider critical exponents defined via susceptibility-type series that do not rely on an ambient Euclidean dimension, and prove that the exponents $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are invariant under local transformations; moreover $\nu$ is invariant under a standard regularity hypothesis on SAW counts (a common slowly varying function).
  Our second set of results concerns bipartite graphs, where the local transformation is applied to one colour class (or to both classes, possibly with different gadgets). In this setting we obtain an analogous relation \[ \mu(G)^{-2}=h\bigl(\mu(G_{\mathrm e})^{-1}\bigr), \] with $h(x)=xg(x)$ when only one class is transformed and $h(x)=g_{\phi_1}(x)\,g_{\phi_2}(x)$ when both are transformed. We further present explicit families of examples, including replacing each degree-3 vertex by a complete-graph gadget $K_N$.</description>

      <title>Transverse modulation in electrovac Brinkmann pp-waves: Maxwell consistency and curvature universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrovac pp--waves in Brinkmann form provide exact Einstein--Maxwell solutions for co--propagating null radiation. Motivated by lensing or scattering, one often ``modulates'' a plane electromagnetic wave by a weak transverse envelope $1+\gamma f(x,y)$. We show that, within the aligned null pp--wave ansatz ($A_v=0$, no $v$--dependence, $F_{xy}=0$) and enforcing the source--free Maxwell equations to $\mathcal O(\gamma)$, a generic profile $f(x,y)$ is incompatible with Maxwell: the transverse field $F_{ui}$ must be both divergence--free and curl--free on the transverse plane, hence $F_{ui}=\partial_i\Phi$ with $\Delta_\perp\Phi=0$.
  We give a minimal, polarization--agnostic gauge completion of the modulated potential and prove a cancellation theorem: under standard decay/regularity (or zero--mode) conditions that exclude additional harmonic transverse modes, all $\mathcal O(\gamma)$ dependence on $f$ drops out of $F_{ui}$ and therefore out of the electrovac source $T_{uu}$. Consequently, the electromagnetic contribution to the Brinkmann profile is universal at $\mathcal O(\gamma)$: the familiar cycle--averaged isotropic $r^2$ term plus an isotropic oscillatory correction at frequency $2\omega$, present only for non-circular polarisation. We isolate the residual Maxwell--admissible freedom as harmonic (holomorphic) transverse data and, by Kerr--Schild linearity, superpose an arbitrary co--propagating vacuum gravitational pp--wave, relating TT--gauge strain to Brinkmann amplitudes. Modelling genuinely localised beams, therefore, requires currents, non-null components, or more general Kundt/gyraton geometries.</description>

      <title>Failure of the mean-field Hartree approximation for a bosonic many-body system with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field Hartree theory is a central tool for reducing interacting many-body dynamics to an effective nonlinear one-particle evolution. This approximation has been employed also when the Hamiltonian that governs the many-body dynamics is not Hermitian. Indeed, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians model particle gain/loss or the evolution of open quantum systems between consecutive quantum jumps. Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\to\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation. We further show that there exists an initial condition such that the exact one-particle marginal state undergoes a finite-time transition to a mixed state, a phenomenon that is completely absent in the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our findings challenge the validity of the mean-field Hartree approximation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and call for additional conditions for the validity of the mean-field regime to model the dynamics of particle gain and loss and the open-system dynamics in bosonic many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double ramification (DR) hierarchies associated to rank-$1$ F-CohFTs are important integrable perturbations of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy. In this paper, we perform bihamiltonian tests for these DR hierarchies, and conjecture that the ones that are bihamiltonian form a $2$-parameter family. Remarkably, our computations suggest that there is a $1$-parameter subfamily of the rank-$1$ F-CohFTs, where the corresponding DR hierarchy is conjecturally Miura equivalent to the Camassa--Holm hierarchy. We also prove a conjecture regarding bihamiltonian Hodge hierarchies. Finally, we systematically study Miura invariants, and for another $1$-parameter subfamily propose a conjectural relation to the Degasperis--Procesi hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The General Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory uses a version of the averaged equations of fluid dynamics, designed to examine interactions between small-amplitude waves and mean flows. These equations are formulated in coordinates following the fluid's average velocity and are often referred to as `pseudo-Lagrangian'. This paper focuses on the principles for deriving the GLM equations, using an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous fluid as a demonstration case. Our exposition methodically differs from others and is aimed at the learners of this theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dimer model in cylindrical domains $\Omega_\delta$ on square grids of mesh size $\delta$ with two Temperleyan boundary components of different colors. Assuming that the $\Omega_\delta$ approximate a cylindrical domain $\Omega$ as $\delta\to 0$, we prove the convergence of height fluctuations to the Gaussian Free Field in $\Omega$ plus an independent discrete Gaussian multiple of the harmonic measure of one of the boundary components. The limit of the dimer coupling functions on $\Omega_\delta$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$ but not conformally covariant. Given this, we determine the limiting structure of height fluctuations from general principles rather than from explicit computations. In particular, our analysis justifies the inevitable appearance of the discrete Gaussian distribution in the doubly connected setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, quantum entanglement has been presented as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information, where sheafification provides a functor that is forgetful with regards to global-from-local signatures while acting faithfully with respect to within-patch multipartite structures. Nontrivial connections to Hecke modifications and the geometric Langlands program are explored in the process. The aim of this work is to validate and extend a number of the claims made in [arXiv:2511.04326] through both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, employing concrete perspectives from condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with potentials that are periodic in some directions and compactly supported in the others. Such systems are known to produce surface states that are weakly confined near the support of the potential. We show that a natural set of surface states exhibits directional ballistic transport, characterized by ballistic transport in the periodic directions and its absence in the others. To prove this, we develop a Floquet theory that captures the analytic variation of surface states. The main idea consists of reformulating the eigenvalue problem for surface states as a Fredholm problem via the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Geometry on Severi-Brauer Schemes: Subsystem Reductions of Azumaya Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate pure-state entanglement in families as a geometric obstruction. In standard quantum information, entanglement is defined relative to a chosen tensor-product factorization of a fixed Hilbert space. In contrast, for a twisted family of pure-state spaces, which can be described by Azumaya algebras $A$ of degree $n$ on $X$ and their Severi-Brauer schemes \[ SB(A)=P\times^{PGL_n}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}\to X, \] such a subsystem choice may fail to globalize. We formalize this algebro-geometrically: fixing a factorization type $\mathbf d=(d_1,\dots,d_s)$ with $n=\prod_i d_i$, the existence of a global product-state locus of type $\mathbf d$ is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying $PGL_n$-torsor $P\to X$ to the stabilizer $G_{\mathbf d}\subset PGL_n$. Thus, entanglement is the obstruction to the existence of a relative Segre subscheme inside $SB(A)$.
  Writing $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ for the Segre variety, we call a reduction to $G_{\mathbf d}$ a $\mathbf d$-subsystem structure. Our first main result identifies the moduli of $\mathbf d$-subsystem structures with the quotient $P/G_{\mathbf d}$. Moreover, we realize naturally $P/G_{\mathbf d}$ as a locally closed subscheme of the relative Hilbert scheme, \[ \text{Hilb}^{\Sigma_{\mathbf d}}\!\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr)\ \subset\ \text{Hilb}\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr), \] parametrizing relative closed subschemes fppf-locally isomorphic to $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\times X$.</description>

      <title>Soliton dynamics in the ABS nonlinear spinor model with external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the novel nonlinear model in (1 + 1)-dimensions for Dirac spinors recently introduced by Alexeeva, Barashenkov, and Saxena [1] (ABS model), which admits an exact explicit solitary-wave (soliton for short) solution. The charge, the momentum, and the energy of this solution are conserved. We investigate the dynamics of the soliton subjected to several potentials: a ramp, a harmonic, and a periodic potential. We develop a Collective Coordinates Theory by making an ansatz for a moving soliton where the position, rapidity, and momentum, are functions of time. We insert the ansatz into the Lagrangian density of the model, integrate over space and obtain a Lagrangian as a function of the collective coordinates. This Lagrangian differs only in the charge and mass with the Lagrangian of a collective coordinates theory for the Gross-Neveu equation. Thus the soliton dynamics in the ABS spinor model is qualitatively the same as in the Gross-Neveu equation, but quantitatively it differs. These results of the collective coordinates theory are confirmed by simulations, i.e., by numerical solutions for solitons of the ABS spinor model, subjected to the above potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of $p$-adic quantum mechanics, we investigate composite systems of $p$-adic qubits and $p$-adically controlled quantum logic gates. We build on the notion of a single $p$-adic qubit as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal group SO(3)$_p$. We show that the classification of these representations reduces to the finite case, as they all factorise through some finite quotient SO(3)$_p$ mod $p^k$. Then, we tackle the problem of $p$-adic qubit composition and entanglement, fundamental for a $p$-adic formulation of quantum information processing. We classify the representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$, and analyse tensor products of two $p$-adic qubit representations lifted from SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$. We solve the Clebsch-Gordan problem for such systems, revealing that the coupled bases decompose into singlet and doublet states. We further study entanglement arising from those stable subsystems. For $p=3$, we construct a set of gates from $4$-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$ that we prove to be universal for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Trace M\"uller Boundary Integral Equation for Electromagnetic Scattering by Composite Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a boundary integral equation for time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by composite dielectric objects. The formulation extends the classical M\"uller equation to composite structures through the global multi-trace method. The key ingredient enabling this extension is the use of the Stratton-Chu representation in complementary region, also known as the extinction property, which augments the off-diagonal blocks of the interior representation operator. The resulting block system is composed entirely of second-kind operators. A Petrov-Galerkin (mixed) discretization using Rao-Wilton-Glisson trial functions and Buffa-Christiansen test functions is employed, yielding linear systems that remain well conditioned on dense meshes and at low frequencies without the need for additional stabilization. This reduces computational costs associated with matrix-vector multiplications and iterative solving. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the method in computing field traces and derived quantities.</description>

In particular, for $n=4$ our findings give a self-contained theoretical interpretation of the groups tabulated in [AJS18], which were obtained with the help of a computer. For each of these groups we provide a set of generators. A prominent role in our analysis is played by a certain family of subgroups of the symmetric group of a discrete square which we call bicompatible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of quantum trajectories conditioned on measurement outcomes. Under a condition related to the absence of so-called dark subspaces, K\"{u}mmerer and Maassen had shown that such trajectories almost surely purify in the long run. In this article, we first present a simple alternative proof of this result using Lyapunov methods. We then strengthen the conclusion by proving that purification actually occurs at an exponential rate in expectation, again using a Lyapunov approach. Furthermore, we address the quantum state estimation problem by propagating two trajectories under the same measurement record--one from the true initial state and the other from an arbitrary initial guess--and show that the estimated trajectory converges exponentially fast to the true one, thus quantifying the rate at which information is progressively revealed through the measurement process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent structures often appear in differential geometry, particularly in the study of non-autonomous differential equations on manifolds. One may study the geodesics associated with a time-dependent Riemannian metric by extremizing the corresponding energy functional, but also through the introduction of a more general concept of time-dependent covariant derivative operator. This relies on the examination of connections on the product manifold $\mathbb{R}\times M$. For these time-dependent covariant derivatives we explore the notions of parallel transport, geodesics and torsion. We also define the derivative of a one-parameter family of connections.</description>

      <title>Generalised contextuality of continuous variable quantum theory can be revealed with a single projective measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized contextuality is a possible indicator of non-classical behaviour in quantum information theory. In finite-dimensional systems, this is justified by the fact that noncontextual theories can be embedded into some simplex, i.e. into a classical theory. We show that a direct application of the standard definition of generalized contextuality to continuous variable systems does not envelope the statistics of some basic measurements, such as the position observable. In other words, we construct families of fully classical, i.e. commuting, measurements that nevertheless can be used to show contextuality of quantum theory. To overcome the apparent disagreement between the two notions of classicality, that is commutativity and noncontextuality, we propose a modified definition of generalised contextuality for continuous-variable systems. The modified definition is based on a physically-motivated approximation procedure, that uses only finite sets of measurement effects. We prove that in the limiting case this definition corresponds exactly to an extension of noncontextual models that benefits from non-constructive response functions. In the process, we discuss the extension of a known connection between contextuality and no-broadcasting to the continuous-variable scenario, and prove structural results regarding fixed points of infinite-dimensional entanglement breaking channels.</description>

      <title>Sharp Inequalities for Schur-Convex Functionals of Partial Traces over Unitary Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many bounds have been proved for partial trace inequalities over the last decades for a large variety of quantities, recent problems in quantum information theory demand sharper bounds. In this work, we study optimal bounds for partial trace quantities in terms of the spectrum; equivalently, we determine the best bounds attainable over unitary orbits of matrices. We solve this question for Schur-convex functionals acting on a single partial trace in terms of eigenvalues for self-adjoint matrices and then we extend these results to singular values of general matrices. We subsequently extend the study to Schur-convex functionals that act on several partial traces simultaneously and present sufficient conditions for sharpness. In cases where closed-form maximizers cannot be identified, we present quadratic programs that yield new computable upper bounds for any Schur-convex functional. We additionally present examples demonstrating improvements over previously known bounds. Finally, we conclude with the study of optimal bounds for an $n$-qubit system and its subsystems of dimension $2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum mixing on large Schreier graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum ergodicity describes the delocalization of most eigenfunctions of Laplace-type operators on graphs or manifolds exhibiting chaotic classical dynamics. Quantum mixing is a stronger notion, additionally controlling correlations between eigenfunctions at different energy levels. In this work, we study families of finite Schreier graphs that converge to an infinite Cayley graph and establish quantum mixing under the assumption that the limiting Cayley graph has absolutely continuous spectrum. The convergence of Schreier graphs is understood in the Benjamini-Schramm sense or in the sense of strong convergence in distribution. Our proofs rely on a new approach to quantum ergodicity, based on trace computations, resolvent approximations and representation theory. We illustrate our assumptions on several examples and provide applications to Schreier graphs associated with free products of groups and right-angled Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Existence of Friedrich-Wintgen Bound States in the Continuum: Cavity with a Thin Waveguide Opening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are localized states embedded within a continuum of propagating waves. Perturbations that disrupt BICs typically induce ultra-strong resonances, a phenomenon enabling diverse applications in photonics. This work investigates the existence of BICs in two-dimensional electromagnetic cavities coupled to thin waveguides for H-polarized waves. Our focus is on Friedrich-Wintgen BICs (FW-BICs), which arise from destructive interference between two resonant modes and were identified numerically in rectangular cavities with waveguide openings by Lyapina et al. [J. Fluid Mech., 780 (2015), pp. 370--387]. Here, we rigorously establish the existence of FW-BICs in a broader class of cavity geometries by introducing perturbations to the refractive index under regularity constraints. We show that BICs correspond to intersections of two curves derived implicitly from the governing equations constructed via the mode-matching method. Crucially, we prove that such intersections are guaranteed for sufficiently small waveguide widths, provided that two eigenvalues of the cavity cross and the associated eigenfunctions exhibit non-vanishing coupling to the radiation channel at the cavity-waveguide interface. Furthermore, our approach remains applicable for studying the emergence of FW-BICs under parameter-dependent boundary perturbations to the cavity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a decomposition of classical potentials into a conservative (gradient) component and a non-conservative component. The latter generalizes the curl component of the force in the three-dimensional case. The force is transformed into a differential $1$-form, known as the work form. This work form is decomposed into an exact (gradient) component and an antiexact component, which in turn generalizes the curl part of the force. The antiexact component is subsequently decomposed using the Frobenius theorem. This local decomposition is a useful tool for identifying the specific components of classical potentials.</description>

Abstract: We prove equivalence of two integral representations for the wave functions of hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland system. For this we study two families of Baxter operators related to hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland and rational Ruijsenaars models; the first one as a limit from hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system, while the second one independently. Besides, computing asymptotics of integral representations and also the value at zero point, we identify them with renormalized Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function.</description>

Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>

      <title>Analytical estimations of edge states and extended states in large finite-size lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk boundary correspondence, one of the most significant features of topological matter, theoretically connects the existence of edge modes at the boundary with topological invariants of the bulk spectral bands. However, it remains unspecified in realistic examples how large the size of a lattice should be for the correspondence to take effect. In this work, we employ the diatomic chain model to introduce an analytical framework to characterize the dependence of edge states on the lattice size and boundary conditions. In particular, we apply asymptotic estimates to examine the bulk boundary correspondence in long diatomic chains as well as precisely quantify the deviations from the bulk boundary correspondence in finite lattices due to symmetry breaking and finite size effects. Moreover, under our framework the eigenfrequencies near the band edges can be well approximated where two special patterns are detected. These estimates on edge states and eigenfrequencies in linear diatomic chains can be further extended to nonlinear chains to investigate the emergence of new nonlinear edge states and other nonlinear localized states. In addition to one-dimensional diatomic chains, examples of more complicated and higher dimensional lattices are provided to show the universality of our analytical framework.</description>

      <title>A Tight-binding Approach for Computing Subwavelength Guided Modes in Crystals with Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an accurate and efficient framework for computing subwavelength guided modes in high-contrast periodic media with line defects, based on a tight-binding approximation. The physical problem is formulated as an eigenvalue problem for the Helmholtz equation with high-contrast parameters. By employing layer potential theory on unbounded domains, we characterize the subwavelength frequencies via the quasi-periodic capacitance matrix. Our main contribution is the proof of exponential decay of the off-diagonal elements of the associated full and quasi-periodic capacitance matrices. These decay properties provide error bounds for the banded approximation of the capacitance matrices, thereby enabling a tight-binding approach for computing the spectral properties of subwavelength resonators with non-compact defects. Various numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results, including applications to topological interface modes.</description>

Abstract: Recently De les Coves, Drescher and Netzer showed that an analogue of the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem fails in the quantum setting. Motivated by this and questions arising in the study of quantum automorphisms of graphs, we introduce a graph-based variant of quantum magic squares and show that the analogue already fails for the cycle \(C_4\), via an explicit counterexample. We also show that they admit monic linear matrix inequality descriptions, hence form compact free spectrahedra.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the momentum distribution of an electron gas in a $3$-dimensional torus. The goal is to compute the occupation number of Fourier modes for some trial state obtained through random phase approximation. We obtain the mean-field analogue of momentum distribution formulas for electron gas in [Daniel and Voskov, Phys. Rev. \textbf{120}, (1960)] in high density limit and [Lam, Phys. Rev. \textbf{3}, (1971)] at metallic density. The analysis in the present paper is majorly based on the work [Christiansen, Hainzl, Nam, Comm. Math. Phys. \textbf{401}, (2023)]. Our findings are related to recent results obtained independently by Benedikter, Lill and Naidu, and the analysis applies to a general class of singular potentials rather than just the Coulomb case.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum transport for the discrete one-dimensional random Jacobi operator of divergence-gradient type. For strictly positive and bounded random variables, we analyze the q-moments of the position operator and establish both upper and lower power-law bounds on their growth. Our approach relies on the asymptotic behavior of the integrated density of states and the Lyapunov exponent near the critical energy 0, previously obtained by Pastur and Figotin. A key ingredient in our analysis is the large deviation-type estimates explored via the phase formalism, which play a central role in deriving bounds on the growth of the transfer matrices.</description>

Abstract: We study an inverse problem related to the dynamical Schr{\"o}dinger equation in a bounded domain of $\Rb^n,n\geq 2$. Since the concerned non-linear Schr\"odinger equation possesses a trivial solution, we linearize the equation around the trivial solution. Demonstrating the well-posedness of the direct problem under appropriate conditions on initial and boundary data, it is observed that the solution admits $\eps$-expansion. By taking into account the fact that the terms $\Oh(|\nabla u(t,x)|^3)$ are negligible in this context, we shall reconstruct the time-dependent coefficients such as electric potential and vector-valued function associated with quadratic nonlinearity from the knowledge of input-output map using the geometric optics solution and Fourier inversion.</description>

Abstract: We define the notion of adjustment for strict Lie 2-groups and provide the complete cocycle description for non-Abelian gerbes with connections whose structure 2-group is an adjusted 2-group. Most importantly, we depart from the common fake-flat connections and employ adjusted connections. This is an important generalisation that is needed for physical applications especially in the context of supergravity. We give a number of explicit examples; in particular, we lift the spin structure on $S^4$, corresponding to an instanton-anti-instanton pair, to a string structure, a 2-group bundle with connection. We also outline how categorified forms of Bogomolny monopoles known as self-dual strings can be obtained via a Penrose-Ward transform of string bundles over twistor space.</description>

Abstract: Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascu\'es et al., New J. Phys. 10, 073013 (2008)], known as the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the scalar extension [A. Pozas-Kerstjens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new bilocal factorisation NPA hierarchy, prove its equivalence to a modified bilocal scalar extension NPA hierarchy, and characterise its convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario. We further explore its relations with the other known generalisations.</description>

      <title>Virtual Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for virtual constraints on Lie groups, with emphasis on mechanical systems modeled as affine connection systems. Virtual holonomic and virtual nonholonomic constraints, including linear and affine nonholonomic constraints, are formulated directly at the level of the Lie algebra and characterized as feedback--invariant manifolds. For each class of constraint, we establish existence and uniqueness conditions for enforcing feedback laws and show that the resulting closed--loop trajectories evolve as the dynamics of mechanical systems endowed with induced constrained connections, generalizing classical holonomic and nonholonomic reductions. Beyond stabilization, the framework enables the systematic generation of low--dimensional motion primitives on Lie groups by enforcing invariant, possibly affine, manifolds and shaping nontrivial dynamical regimes. The approach is illustrated through representative examples, including quadrotor UAVs and a rigid body with an internal rotor, where classical control laws are recovered as special cases and affine constraint--induced motion primitives are obtained.</description>

      <title>On Dirac equations on phase spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Dirac equations on relativistic phase spaces $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$, where ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ is Minkowski space with $p=2,4$. We use the geometric quantization approach in which the wave functions are polarized sections of a complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$. The covariant derivatives with connection $A_{\sf{vac}}$ in this bundle define canonical commutation relations. Fermions are charged with respect to the field $A_{\sf{vac}}$, so lifting the Dirac equations from space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ to phase space $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ results in their solutions being localized in the space ${\mathbb R}^{p-1}$ or in space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$. We describe the explicit form of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and optimal transport of point processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine optimal matchings or transport between two stationary random measures. It covers allocation from the Lebesgue measure to a point process and matching a point process to a regular (shifted) lattice. The main focus of the article is the impact of hyperuniformity(reduced variance fluctuations in point processes) to optimal transport: in dimension 2, we show that the typical matching cost has finite second moment under a mild logarithmic integrability condition on the reduced pair correlation measure, showing that most planar hyperuniform point processes are L2-perturbed lattices. Our method also retrieves known sharp bounds in finite windows for neutral integrable systems such as Poisson processes, and also applies to hyperfluctuating systems. Further, in three dimensions onwards, all point processes with an integrable pair correlation measure are L2-perturbed lattices without requiring hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>A restricted additive smoother for finite cell flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adaptive geometric multigrid method for the solution of large-scale finite cell flow problems. The finite cell method seeks to circumvent the need for a boundary-conforming mesh through the embedding of the physical domain in a regular background mesh. As a result of the intersection between the physical domain and the background computational mesh, the resultant systems of equations are typically numerically ill-conditioned, rendering the appropriate treatment of cutcells a crucial aspect of the solver. To this end, we propose a smoother operator with favorable parallel properties and discuss its memory footprint and parallelization aspects. We propose three cache policies that offer a balance between cached and on-the-fly computation and discuss the optimization opportunities offered by the smoother operator. It is shown that the smoother operator, on account of its additive nature, can be replicated in parallel exactly with little communication overhead, which offers a major advantage in parallel settings as the geometric multigrid solver is consequently independent of the number of processes. The convergence and scalability of the geometric multigrid method is studied using numerical examples. It is shown that the iteration count of the solver remains bounded independent of the problem size and depth of the grid hierarchy. The solver is shown to obtain excellent weak and strong scaling using numerical benchmarks with more than 665 million degrees of freedom. The presented geometric multigrid solver is, therefore, an attractive option for the solution of large-scale finite cell problems in massively parallel high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with O(1)-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</description>

      <title>Torsion and semi-degeneracy of second-order maximally superintegrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isotropic harmonic oscillator and the Kepler-Coulomb system are pivotal models in the Sciences. They are two examples of second-order (maximally) superintegrable (Hamiltonian) systems. These systems are classified in dimension two. A partial classification exists in dimension three.
  In this paper, our focus is on second-order superintegrable systems with a $(n+1)$-parameter potential with $n\geq3$. We find that these systems are underpinned by an information-geometric structure, namely the structure of a statistical manifold with torsion.
  We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such systems to extend to non-degenerate systems, i.e. to admit a maximal family of compatible potentials. The condition is geometric: we show that a $(n+1)$-parameter potential is the restriction of a non-degenerate potential if and only if a certain trace-free tensor field vanishes. We interpret this condition as the requirement that a certain affine connection has vectorial torsion.
  We also show that the condition for a system to be extendable is conformally invariant, allowing us to extend our results to second-order conformally superintegrable systems with a $(n+1)$-parameter potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle in the wrong box (or: the perils of finite-dimensional approximations)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When numerically simulating the unitary time evolution of an infinite-dimensional quantum system, one is usually led to treat the Hamiltonian $H$ as an "infinite-dimensional matrix" by expressing it in some orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, and then truncate it to some finite dimensions. However, the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equations generated by the truncated Hamiltonians need not converge, in general, to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the actual Hamiltonian.
  In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian which crucially depends on the particular choice of basis: the Friedrichs extension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations of elements of the basis. Importantly, this is generally different from $H$ itself; in all such cases, numerical simulations will unavoidably reproduce the wrong dynamics in the limit, and yet there is no numerical test that can reveal this failure, unless one has the analytical solution to compare with.
  As a practical demonstration of such results, we consider the quantum particle in the box, and we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include associated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated by the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to the one corresponding to the particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, regardless the initial choice of boundary conditions. Other such examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>A non-semisimple non-invertible symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the action of a non-invertible symmetry on spins chains whose topological lines are labelled by representations of the four-dimensional Taft algebra. The main peculiarity of this symmetry is the existence of junctions between distinct indecomposable lines. Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several symmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse their ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena. First, we identify a smooth path of gapped symmetric Hamiltonians whose ground states transform inequivalently under the symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry, and propose an explanation for the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit in terms of the symmetry category.</description>

Abstract: We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus in terms of the projective representation of $GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to non-orientable surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we may assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to non-orientable surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry, which can be seen as a necessary condition for the existence of topological quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules is reconsidered to obtain more properties of these special Hilbert C*-modules. The property of a Hilbert C*-module to be a multiplier C*-module is shown to be an invariant with respect to the consideration as a left or right Hilbert C*-module in the sense of a imprimitivity bimodule in strong Morita equivalence theory. The interrelation of the C*-algebras of ''compact'' operators, the Banach algebras of bounded module operators and the Banach spaces of bounded module operators of a Hilbert C*-module to its C*-dual Banach C*-module, are characterized for pairs of Hilbert C*-modules and their respective multiplier modules. The structures on the latter are always isometrically embedded into the respective structures on the former. Examples are given for which continuation of these kinds of bounded module operators from the initial Hilbert C*-module to its multiplier module fails. However, existing continuations turn out to be always unique. Similarly, bounded modular functionals from both kinds of Hilbert C*-modules to their respective C*-algebras of coefficients are compared, and eventually existing continuations are shown to be unique.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of shape transitions in frustrated elastic ribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ribbons are elastic bodies of thickness $t$ and width $w$ with $t\ll w\ll 1$ (after appropriate nondimensionalization). Many ribbons in nature have a non-trivial internal geometry, making them incompatible with Euclidean space. This incompatibility -- expressed mathematically as a failure of the Gauss-Codazzi equations for surfaces -- can trigger shape transitions between narrow and wide ribbons. These transitions depend on the internal geometry: ribbons whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Gauss equation always exhibit a transition, whereas those whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Codazzi equations, may or may not. We give the first rigorous analysis of this phenomenon, mainly for ribbons whose first fundamental form is flat. For Gauss-incompatible ribbons we identify the natural energy scaling of the problem and prove the existence of a shape transition. For Codazzi-incompatible ribbons we give a necessary condition for a transition to occur. Furthermore, our study reveals a fundamental distinction: the transition is "microscopic" for Gauss-incompatible ribbons, persisting as the width tends to $0$, whereas it is "mesoscopic" for Codazzi-incompatible ribbons, observable only at small but finite width. The results are obtained by calculating the $\Gamma$-limits, as $t,w\to 0$, for narrow ribbons ($w^2 \ll t$), and wide ribbons (taking $t$ to zero and then $w$), in the natural energy scalings dictated by the internal geometry.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology Principles behind Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for realizing scalable quantum technologies, and topological quantum error correction (TQEC) has emerged as the most experimentally advanced paradigm of QEC. Existing homological and topological code constructions, however, are largely confined to orientable two-manifolds with simple boundary conditions. In this work, we develop a unified algebraic-topological framework for TQEC based on homology, cohomology, and intersection theory, which characterizes exactly when an arbitrary-dimensional manifold (with or without boundary) can serve as a quantum memory, thereby extending the standard 2D homological-code picture to arbitrary dimension and to manifolds with boundary via Poincar\'e-Lefschetz duality. Building on this classification, we introduce concrete code families that exploit nontrivial topology beyond the planar and toric settings. These include ``3-torus code'' and higher-dimensional ``volume codes'' on compact manifolds with mixed $X$- and $Z$-type boundaries. We further give a topological construction of qudit TQEC codes on general two-dimensional cell complexes using group presentation complexes, which unifies and extends several known quantum LDPC and homological-product-like constructions within a single geometric language. Finally, we combine the theoretical framework with numerical simulations to demonstrate that changing only the global topology can yield improved logical performance at fixed entanglement resources. Taken together, our results provide a systematic set of topological design principles for constructing and analyzing TQEC codes across dimensions and boundaries, and they open new avenues for topology-aware fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Quantum Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_t=\Delta_x = \epsilon$, QCAs constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles and their interactions with gauge fields, e.g., $(3+1)$D Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high-energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues, of which the most infamous is Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well understood in particular in the real-time, discrete-space \emph{but} continuous-time settings of Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\epsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend this analysis to the real-time, discrete-space \emph{and} discrete-time schemes that QCAs are. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCAs for $\Delta_t =\Delta_x = \epsilon \neq 0$. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavor-staggering-only way of fixing FD that does not break the chiral symmetry of the massless scheme. We explain how this method coexists with the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and give an example of neutrino-like QCA showing that our model allows to put chiral fermions interacting via the weak interaction on a spacetime lattice, without running into any FD problem.</description>

      <title>Locating Extremal Periodic Orbits for the Planar Circular Restricted Three Body Problem using Polynomial Sum-of-Squares Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an increasing interest in the design of long and complex space missions, the search for orbits that require the least amount of fuel is of fundamental interest. This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization technique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of tight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for large polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative polynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise parts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization techniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the relevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such orbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel expenditure. As practical applications to space mission designs, we converge UPOs that minimise transmitted power required by satellites for the Earth-Moon system in a communication relay problem by minimizing the infinite-time average of sum of squares of distances of a satellite from Earth and the Moon.</description>

      <title>Exact CHY Integrand Construction Using Combinatorial Neural Networks and Discrete Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a rational CHY integrand that realizes prescribed physical pole constraints is a discrete inverse problem whose combinatorial complexity grows with multiplicity. We encode the pole hierarchy through generalized pole degrees $K(A)$ (channels $s_A$), defined as signed internal-edge counts associated with particle subsets in a colored integrand graph. Additivity under integrand multiplication together with the elementary face recursion on the subset lattice expresses all higher-channel $K(A)$ as linear functions of the two-particle data $\{K(s_{ij})\}$ and reduces the inverse step to a mixed-integer linear feasibility problem. The subset lattice provides a fixed dependency graph for deterministic message passing with forward evaluation and backward residual propagation; this computation is parameter-free and involves no training. In factorial-rescaled variables $\widetilde K(A)=(|A|-2)!\,K(A)$, every local update is integral, so propagation is exact in the rescaled recursion variables and does not rely on numerical reconstruction. We further organize generalized integrand graphs by an $n$-regular grading under multiplication, where degree-zero (0-regular) factors act as M\"obius-invariant insertions that can be decomposed into four-point cross ratios. We illustrate the construction at six and eight points, including pick-pole selection and higher-order pole reduction.</description>

      <title>Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in $(2+1)$D abelian bosonic topological phases. Time-reversal anomalies in such systems are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in $(3+1)$D, and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2$. These partition functions are related by the anomaly formula \begin{equation*}
  Z(\mathbb{RP}^4)\, Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \theta_{\mathcal{M}}, \end{equation*} where $\theta_\mathcal{M}$ is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges $\xi_n$, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation $Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \xi_1$, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula that involves both the higher central charges $\xi_n$ and a new time-reversal invariant $\eta_n$. Introducing a distinguished subset $\mathcal{M}^n \subset \mathcal{A}$ of anyons, we establish the relation \begin{equation*}
  \eta_n \cdot \xi_n = \frac{\sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n}{\left| \sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n \right|}, \end{equation*} which generalizes the known anomaly formula.
  We analyze the algebraic structure of $\mathcal{M}^n$, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description>

      <title>Commuting integrable maps from a deformed D$_4$ cluster algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit an integrable map of the plane which we obtained recently as a two-parameter family of deformed mutations in the cluster algebra of type D$_4$. The rational first integral for this map defines an invariant foliation of the plane by level curves, and we explain how this corresponds to a rational elliptic surface of rank 2. This leads us to construct another (independent) integrable map, commuting with the first, such that both maps lift to compositions of mutations in an enlarged cluster algebra, whose underlying quiver is equivalent to the one found by Okubo for the $q$-Painlev\'e VI equation. The degree growth of the two commuting maps is calculated in two different ways: firstly, from the tropical (max-plus) equations for the d-vectors of the cluster variables; and secondly, by constructing the minimal space of initial conditions for the two maps, via blowing up $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hamiltonian for a quantum state with finite entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following task: how for a given quantum state $\rho$ to find a grounded Hamiltonian $H$ satisfying the condition $\mathrm{Tr} H\rho\leq E_0&lt;+\infty$ in such a way that the von Neumann entropy of the Gibbs state $\gamma_H(E)$ corresponding to a given energy $E&gt;0$ be as small as possible.
  We show that for any mixed state $\rho$ with finite entropy and any $E&gt;0$ there exists a solution $H(\rho,E_0,E)$ of the above problem (unique in the non-degenerate case) which we call optimal Hamiltonian for the state $\rho$. Explicit expressions for $H(\rho,E_0,E)$, $\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E)$ and $S(\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E))$ are obtained. Analytical properties of the function $E\mapsto S(\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E))$ are explored. Several examples are considered.
  We also consider a modification of the above task in which arbitrary Hamiltonians (not necessarily grounded) are considered.
  The basic application motivated this research is described. As examples, new semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and for the entanglement of formation are obtained and briefly discussed (with the intention to give a detailed analysis in a separate article).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithmic framework for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI), which is applicable to general graph structures. The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We focus our theoretical analysis on complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, a global symmetry acting on them is generally realized in a projective manner. Symmetry fractionalization encodes this projective realization. The obstruction to defining symmetry fractionalization is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose nontriviality signals a failure to define symmetry fractionalization consistently. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</description>

      <title>Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Black Hole Thermodynamic Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent interesting development in the dynamics of black hole phase transitions has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the thermodynamic phase transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise,
  unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole</description>

      <title>Consistent kinetic modeling of compressible flows with variable Prandtl numbers: Double-distribution quasi-equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consistent kinetic modeling and discretization strategy for compressible flows across all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios is developed using the quasi-equilibrium approach within two of the most widely used double-distribution frameworks. The methodology ensures accurate recovery of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, including all macroscopic moments and dissipation rates, through detailed hydrodynamic limit analysis and careful construction of equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium attractors. Discretization is performed using high-order velocity lattices with a static reference frame in a discrete velocity Boltzmann context to isolate key modeling aspects such as the necessary requirements on expansion and quadrature orders. The proposed models demonstrate high accuracy, numerical stability and Galilean invariance across a wide range of Mach numbers and temperature ratios. Separate tests for strict conservation and measurements of all dissipation rates confirm these insights for all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios. Simulations of a thermal Couette flow and a sensitive two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction excellently reproduce viscous Navier-Stokes-Fourier-level physics. The proposed models establish an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible flows with moderate supersonic speeds and discontinuities at arbitrary Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics and paving the way for future extensions to the lattice Boltzmann context, by application of correction terms, as well as high-Mach and hypersonic regimes, employing target-designed reference frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the requirement that the trace of the stress-energy tensor of matter must vanish if invariance under Weyl transformations is a symmetry of a given gravitational theory is not universal. This requirement holds whenever the masses of timelike fields are constant parameters that are not transformed by conformal transformations, or when the energy density of perfect fluids transforms as $\rho\rightarrow\Omega^{-3}\rho$. In contrast, if the masses of timelike fields are point-dependent quantities transforming under conformal transformations as $m\rightarrow\Omega^{-1}m$, and the energy density of perfect fluids transforms as $\rho\rightarrow\Omega^{-4}\rho$, the Weyl symmetry does not require the vanishing of the trace of the matter SET. In consequence, any matter fields, regardless of whether the trace of their stress-energy tensor vanishes or not, can be coupled to gravity. The phenomenological and physical consequences of the novel result are drawn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional nonlocal degenerate fourth-order parabolic equation with inhomogeneous forces relevant to hydraulic fracture modeling. Employing a regularization scheme, modified energy/entropy methods, and novel differential inequality techniques, we establish global existence and long-time behavior results for weak solutions under both time-and space-dependent and time-and space-independent inhomogeneous forces. Specifically, for the time-and space-dependent force $S(t, x)$, we prove that the solution converges to $\bar{u}_0+\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_0^\infty \int_\Omega S(r, x)\, dxdr $, where $\bar{u}_0=\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}u_{0}(x)\,dx$ is the spatial average of the initial data, and we provide bilateral estimates for the convergence rate. For the time-and space-independent force $S_0$, we show that the solution approaches the linear function $\bar{u}_0 + tS_0$ at an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>Gauss Principle in Incompressible Flow: Unified Variational Perspective on Pressure and Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following recent work (Gonzalez and Taha 2022; Peters and Ormiston 2025), this manuscript clarifies what the Gauss-Appell principle determines in incompressible, inviscid flow and how it connects to classical projection methods. At a fixed time, freezing the velocity and varying only the material acceleration leads to minimization of a quadratic subject to acceleration-level constraints. First-order conditions yield a Poisson-Neumann problem for a reaction pressure whose gradient removes the non-solenoidal and wall-normal content of the provisional residual, i.e. the Leray-Hodge projection. Thus, Gauss-Appell enforces the instantaneous kinematic constraints and recovers Euler at the instant. In steady flows, this principle -- on its own -- cannot select circulation or stagnation points because these are properties of the velocity state, not the instantaneous acceleration correction. The principle only determines the reaction pressure for an already-specified velocity field. The impressed/reaction pressure bookkeeping can be supplemented with orthogonality conventions that separate prescribed conservative forcing (if any) from the reaction enforcing the constraints. This variational viewpoint also yields a simple computational diagnostic: the minimized Appellian equals a L-2 norm of the reaction-pressure gradient which vanishes for constraint-compatible updates and grows with the magnitude of divergence and wall-flux mismatch. The goal of this note is simply to lend more clarity to the application of the Gauss principle, and to connect it concretely to well known concepts including potential flow theory, recent variational approaches and projection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.
  Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</description>

      <title>CLT for the trace functional of the IDS of magnetic random Schr\"{o}dinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the existence of the integrated density of states (IDS) of the magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a random potential on the Hilbert space \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \), as an analogue of the law of large numbers (LLN) for trace functionals. In this work, we establish an analogue of the central limit theorem (CLT), which describes the fluctuations of the trace functionals of the IDS, for a class of test functions denoted by \( C^1_{d,0}(\mathbb{R}) \). This class consists of real-valued, continuously differentiable functions on \( \mathbb{R} \) that decay at the rate \( O(|x|^{-m}) \) as \( |x| \to \infty \), where \( m &gt; d + 1 \).</description>

      <title>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a method to extend a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole convex, related to convex extension. This construction broadens the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case of the convex being a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the folded Kantorovich cost and folded Wasserstein distances, and study their induced metric properties. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Franca [4], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. We also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [16] cost writes as a folded Kantorovich cost. Folded optimal transport therefore provides a unified framework for classical, semiclassical and separable quantum optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Generalised 4d Partition Functions and Modular Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence of a class of generalised Schur partition functions $\mathcal Z_G(q;\alpha)$ of 4d $\mathcal N=2$ superconformal gauge theories to contour integral representations of vector-valued modular forms of the type that arise in 2d rational conformal field theories (RCFT). Concretely, we consider the $USp(2N)$ theory with $2N+2$ fundamental hypermultiplets and analytically prove that $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha)$ satisfies an order-$(N+1)$ modular linear differential equation (MLDE) with vanishing Wronskian index, explaining how the parameter $\alpha$ of the former determines the parameters of the latter. Several connections are made to characters of RCFTs including unitary ones. We then propose a two-parameter extension $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha,\beta)$ of the generalised Schur partition function. Finally, we relate the $\alpha=-k$ specialisation to quantum monodromy traces ${\rm Tr}\,M^k$ and formulate a conjecture linking their $k$-dependence to MLDEs.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Standard Quantum Detailed Balance and Thermodynamically Consistent Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, for a quantum Markovian semigroup on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, if it satisfies the standard quantum detailed balance condition, its generator admits a special representation that yields a vanishing entropy production rate. Conversely, if the generator admits a special representation adhering to the condition of thermodynamic consistency and leading to a vanishing entropy production rate, then the corresponding quantum Markovian semigroup must satisfy the standard quantum detailed balance condition. In this context, we adopt the definition of entropy production rate that is motivated by the physics literature and standard for thermodynamically consistent Lindbladians.</description>

      <title>Chaotic discretization theorems for forced linear and nonlinear coupled oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODEs systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external non-conservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system presenting 1D and 2D bifurcation diagrams, together with spectra of Lyapunov exponents and basins of attraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful new framework for classifying and simulating correlated and topological phases of quantum matter. Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall. These lecture notes provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual, computational and mathematical aspects of this theory.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical periodic Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbols in the critical model, and leads to a few square-root products for the leg functions. The square root products allow simple integral representations, that further reduce to the Binet's second integral and its generalization by Hermite, in the finite volume scaling limit. This leads to product formulas for the spin operator matrix elements in the scaling limit, providing explicit expressions for the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, that were computed iteratively in Yurov:1991my. They are all rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. We also determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap. Moreover, by expanding the spin-spin two point correlator in the fermionic basis, we observed a Fredholm determinant identity that allows to show the convergence of the rescaled two-point correlator to the CFT version on a cylinder.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum Channels in Diamond Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04180v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ \Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A= rd_B$, and $\Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon^2 \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A\le rd_B/2$. These lower bounds improve upon the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit, near-optimal $\varepsilon$-dependence. Moreover, when $d_A\le rd_B/2$, the lower bound is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. The proof constructs ensembles of channels that are well separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Log-Size Master Equation for Fragmentation PBEs: Jump Transport, Drift--Diffusion Asymptotics, and PSD Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation population-balance equations (PBEs) describe how particle size distributions (PSDs) evolve under breakage and daughter fragment redistribution. From a standard self-similar fragmentation class we derive an \emph{exact conservative transport equation in log-size} for the \emph{normalized mass fraction}: a state-dependent \emph{pure-jump} master equation (nonlocal internal-coordinate mass transfer). We also give an explicit Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) factorization whose diagonal sector reproduces this master equation, used here as an \emph{optional} structure-preserving operator representation and constrained parameterization for inverse modeling (rather than a computational necessity).
  In a controlled small-jump regime, the nonlocal jump transport reduces to a drift--diffusion (Fokker--Planck) operator in log-size space. Under detailed-balance conditions this operator admits the standard symmetrization to a self-adjoint Schr\"odinger-type spectral problem, enabling compact parametric hypothesis classes for PSD shapes. We then present two inverse routes: (i) time-resolved parametric fitting of transport/spectral parameters, and (ii) a regularized steady-state inversion that reconstructs an effective potential from a measured steady PSD.
  To address practical validation, we include numerical benchmarks: forward simulation of the jump transport model (CTMC discretization) and its drift--diffusion reduction, quantitative discrepancy metrics, and inverse parameter recovery on an Airy half-line synthetic benchmark under controlled multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the Ising free energy on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,m)$ with bounded average degree $d=2m/n$. Specifically, we determine the limiting distribution of $\log Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$, where $Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$ is the partition function at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $B\geq0$.
  If either $B&gt;0$, or $B=0$, $d&gt;1$ and $\beta&gt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is a Gaussian whose variance is of order $\Theta(n)$ and is described by a family of stochastic fixed point problems that encode the root magnetisation of two correlated Galton-Watson trees. By contrast, if $B=0$ and either $d\leq1$ or $\beta&lt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is an infinite sum of independent random variables and has bounded variance.</description>

      <title>Frame eversion and contextual geometric rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rigidity results describing contextually-constrained maps defined on Grassmannians and manifolds of ordered independent line tuples in finite-dimensional vector or Hilbert spaces. One statement in the spirit of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry classifies maps between full Grassmannians of two $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, $n\ge 3$, preserving dimension and lattice operations for pairs with commuting orthogonal projections, as precisely those induced by semilinear injections unique up to scaling.
  In a different but related direction, denote the manifolds of ordered orthogonal (linearly-independent) $n$-tuples of lines in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $V$ by $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(V)$ (respectively $\mathbb{F}(V)$) and, for partitions $\pi$ of the set $\{1..n\}$, call two tuples $\pi$-linked if the spans along $\pi$-blocks agree. A Wigner-style rigidity theorem proves that the symmetric maps $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(\mathbb{C}^n)\to \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, $n\ge 3$ respecting $\pi$-linkage are precisely those induced by semilinear injections, hence by linear or conjugate-linear maps if also assumed measurable. On the other hand, in the $\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$-defined analogue the only other possibility is a qualitatively new type of purely-contextual-global symmetry transforming a tuple $(\ell_i)_i$ of lines into $\left(\left(\bigoplus_{j\ne i}\ell_j\right)^{\perp}\right)_i$.</description>
