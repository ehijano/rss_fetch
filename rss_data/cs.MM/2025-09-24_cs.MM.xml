      <title>CPCLDETECTOR: Knowledge Enhancement and Alignment Selection for Chinese Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18562v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese Patronizing and Condescending Language (CPCL) is an implicitly discriminatory toxic speech targeting vulnerable groups on Chinese video platforms. The existing dataset lacks user comments, which are a direct reflection of video content. This undermines the model's understanding of video content and results in the failure to detect some CPLC videos. To make up for this loss, this research reconstructs a new dataset PCLMMPLUS that includes 103k comment entries and expands the dataset size. We also propose the CPCLDetector model with alignment selection and knowledge-enhanced comment content modules. Extensive experiments show the proposed CPCLDetector outperforms the SOTA on PCLMM and achieves higher performance on PCLMMPLUS . CPLC videos are detected more accurately, supporting content governance and protecting vulnerable groups. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/jiaxunyang256/PCLD.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Personalized Product Search with Query-aware Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized product search (PPS) aims to retrieve products relevant to the given query considering user preferences within their purchase histories. Since large language models (LLM) exhibit impressive potential in content understanding and reasoning, current methods explore to leverage LLM to comprehend the complicated relationships among user, query and product to improve the search performance of PPS. Despite the progress, LLM-based PPS solutions merely take textual contents into consideration, neglecting multimodal contents which play a critical role for product search. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework, HMPPS, for \textbf{H}arnessing \textbf{M}ultimodal large language models (MLLM) to deal with \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{P}roduct \textbf{S}earch based on multimodal contents. Nevertheless, the redundancy and noise in PPS input stand for a great challenge to apply MLLM for PPS, which not only misleads MLLM to generate inaccurate search results but also increases the computation expense of MLLM. To deal with this problem, we additionally design two query-aware refinement modules for HMPPS: 1) a perspective-guided summarization module that generates refined product descriptions around core perspectives relevant to search query, reducing noise and redundancy within textual contents; and 2) a two-stage training paradigm that introduces search query for user history filtering based on multimodal representations, capturing precise user preferences and decreasing the inference cost. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of HMPPS. Furthermore, HMPPS is deployed on an online search system with billion-level daily active users and achieves an evident gain in A/B testing.</description>

      <title>StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Visual Deepfake Detection: Can AI Predict and Prevent Fake Content Before It's Created?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements, zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection, multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against the rising tide of deepfake attacks.</description>

      <title>LEAF-Mamba: Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion State Space Model for RGB-D Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Pre-training CLIP against Data Poisoning with Optimal Transport-based Matching and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.</description>

      <title>Pay More Attention To Audio: Mitigating Imbalance of Cross-Modal Attention in Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) often suffer from audio-textual attention imbalance, prioritizing text over acoustic information, particularly in the multi-modal fusion layers of the Transformer architecture. This bias hinders their ability to fully utilize acoustic cues, causing suboptimal performance on audio reasoning tasks. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{MATA}, a novel training-free method that dynamically pushes LALMs to pay \textbf{M}ore \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{T}o \textbf{A}udio tokens within the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, MATA intervenes post raw attention scoring, targeting only the last token in intermediate layers without introducing additional parameters or computational overhead. Experiments on the MMAU and MMAR benchmarks confirm MATA's effectiveness, with consistent performance gains. Notably, on MMAR, MATA enables an open-source model to surpass the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash for the first time. Our work provides an efficient solution to mitigate attention bias and opens a new research direction for enhancing the audio-processing capabilities of multi-modal models.</description>

      <title>Text Slider: Efficient and Plug-and-Play Continuous Concept Control for Image/Video Synthesis via LoRA Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control, while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$, respectively.</description>

      <title>DRISHTIKON: A Multimodal Multilingual Benchmark for Testing Language Models' Understanding on Indian Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The dataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines, art forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models, proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models, across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded, multimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented traditions. DRISHTIKON fills a vital gap in inclusive AI research, offering a robust testbed to advance culturally aware, multimodally competent language technologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sub-pixel Motion Compensation in Learned Video Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion compensation is a key component of video codecs. Conventional codecs (HEVC and VVC) have carefully refined this coding step, with an important focus on sub-pixel motion compensation. On the other hand, learned codecs achieve sub-pixel motion compensation through simple bilinear filtering. This paper offers to improve learned codec motion compensation by drawing inspiration from conventional codecs. It is shown that the usage of more advanced interpolation filters, block-based motion information and finite motion accuracy lead to better compression performance and lower decoding complexity. Experimental results are provided on the Cool-chic video codec, where we demonstrate a rate decrease of more than 10% and a lowering of motion-related decoding complexity from 391 MAC per pixel to 214 MAC per pixel.

      <title>LongLLaVA: Scaling Multi-modal LLMs to 1000 Images Efficiently via a Hybrid Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expanding the long-context capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) is critical for advancing video understanding and high-resolution image analysis. Achieving this requires systematic improvements in model architecture, data construction, and training strategies, particularly to address challenges such as performance degradation with increasing image counts and high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer blocks, introduce data construction methods that capture both temporal and spatial dependencies, and employ a progressive training strategy. Our released model, LongLLaVA (\textbf{Long}-Context \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{a}nd \textbf{V}ision \textbf{A}ssistant), demonstrates an effective balance between efficiency and performance. LongLLaVA achieves competitive results across various benchmarks while maintaining high throughput and low memory consumption. Notably, it can process nearly one thousand images on a single A100 80GB GPU, underscoring its potential for a wide range of multi-modal applications.</description>

      <title>DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-LLM fusion Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We open-source the codes, models and datasets we constructed: github.com/sony/DeepResonance.</description>

      <title>LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code is released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.</description>

      <title>LookAhead Tuning: Safer Language Models via Partial Answer Previews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19041</link>

Abstract: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often compromises their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.</description>

      <title>WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 53.4$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</description>
