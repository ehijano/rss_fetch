      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. I. Confirmation of a 31-day planet orbiting HD 86728</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With close to three years of observations in hand, the NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) is starting to unearth new astrophysical signals for a curated sample of bright, radial velocity (RV)-quiet stars. We present the discovery of the first NETS exoplanet, HD 86728 b, a $m_p\sin i = 9.16^{+0.55}_{-0.56}\ \rm{M}_\oplus$ planet on a circular, $P=31.1503^{+0.0062}_{-0.0066}$ d orbit, thereby confirming a candidate signal identified by Hirsch et al. (2021). We confirm the planetary origin of the detected signal, which has a semi-amplitude of just $K=1.91^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$ m s$^{-1}$, via careful analysis of the NEID RVs and spectral activity indicators, and we constrain the mass and orbit via fits to NEID and archival RV measurements. The host star is intrinsically quiet at the $\sim1$ m s$^{-1}$ level, with the majority of this variability likely stemming from short-timescale granulation. HD 86728 b is among the small fraction of exoplanets with similar masses and periods that have no known planetary siblings.</description>

      <title>Surface properties of the Kalliope-Linus system from ALMA and VLA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance and distribution of metal in asteroid surfaces can be constrained from thermal emission measurements at radio wavelengths, informing our understanding of planetesimal differentiation processes. We observed the M-type asteroid (22) Kalliope and its moon Linus in thermal emission at 1.3, 9, and 20 mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) over most of Kalliope's rotation period. The 1.3 mm data provide ~30 km resolution on the surface of Kalliope, while both the 1.3 and 9 mm data resolve Linus from Kalliope. We find a thermal inertia for Kalliope of 116$^{+326}_{-91}$ J m$^{-2}$ s$^{-0.5}$ K$^{-1}$ and emissivities of 0.65$\pm$0.02 at 1.3 mm, 0.56$\pm$0.03 at 9 mm, and 0.77$\pm$0.02 at 20 mm. Kalliope's millimeter wavelength emission is suppressed compared to its centimeter wavelength emission, and is also depolarized. We measure emissivities for Linus of 0.73$\pm$0.04 and 0.85$\pm$0.17 at 1.3 and 9 mm respectively, indicating a less metal-rich surface composition for Linus. Spatial variability in Kalliope's emissivity reveals a region in the northern hemisphere with a high dielectric constant, suggestive of enhanced metal content. These results are together consistent with a scenario in which Linus formed from reaggregated ejecta from an impact onto a differentiated Kalliope, leaving Kalliope with a higher surface metal content than Linus, which is distributed heterogeneously across its surface. The low emissivity and lack of polarization suggest a reduced regolith composition where iron is in the form of metallic grains and constitutes ~25% of the surface composition.</description>

      <title>Thermophysical Modelling of Eclipse and Occultation Events in Binary Asteroid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems comprise approximately 15 per cent of the near-Earth asteroid population, yet thermal-infrared data are often interpreted for these bodies as if they are single objects. Thermal-IR light curves of binary asteroids (3905) Doppler and (175706) 1996 FG3 are analysed using an adaptation of the Advanced Thermophysical Model, deriving new constraints on their thermal inertias as $\Gamma = 114 \pm 31 \mathrm{J} \mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{K}^{-1} \mathrm{s}^{-1/2}$ and $\Gamma = 142 \pm 6 \mathrm{J} \mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{K}^{-1} \mathrm{s}^{-1/2}$, respectively. We determine that this adapted model is suitable for binary systems where their primary rotation to secondary orbit period ratios can be approximately characterised by small integers. Objects with more complex orbital states require a model with alternative temperature convergence methodologies. Thermal inertia is shown to have a strong effect on binary thermophysical light curve morphology, introducing significant modulations both inside and outside of mutual event times. The depth of eclipse events are shown to be suppressed at longer wavelengths due to the sensitivity to cooler parts of the surface, meanwhile surface roughness is shown to have little effect on the thermal light curve morphology. A proof of concept model for the (65803) Didymos system is demonstrated, showing how such a binary model could be used to study the system during the European Space Agency's Hera mission, and the applicability of this adapted model to NASA's Lucy mission is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Radiative Signatures of Circumplanetary Disks and Envelopes During the Late Stages of Giant Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the late stages of giant planet formation, protoplanets are surrounded by a circumplanetary disk and an infalling envelope of gas and dust. For systems with sufficient cooling, material entering the sphere of influence of the planet falls inward and approaches ballistic conditions. Due to conservation of angular momentum, most of the incoming material falls onto the disk rather than directly onto the planet. This paper determines the spectral energy distributions of forming planets in this stage of evolution. Generalizing previous work, we consider a range of possible geometries for the boundary conditions of the infall and determine the two-dimensional structure of the envelope, as well as the surface density of the disk. After specifying the luminosity sources for the planet and disk, we calculate the corresponding radiative signatures for the system, including the emergent spectral energy distributions and emission maps. These results show how the observational appearance of forming planets depend on the input parameters, including the instantaneous mass, mass accretion rate, semimajor axis of the orbit, and the planetary magnetic field strength (which sets the inner boundary condition for the disk). We also consider different choices for the form of the opacity law and attenuation due to the background circumstellar disk. Although observing forming planets will be challenging, these results show how the observational signatures depend on the underlying properties of the planet/disk/envelope system.</description>

      <title>Life in the Bubble: How a nearby supernova left ephemeral footprints on the cosmic-ray spectrum and indelible imprints on life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth sits inside a 300pc-wide void that was carved by a series of supernova explosions that went off tens of millions of years ago, pushing away interstellar gas and creating a bubble-like structure. The 60Fe peak deposits found in the deep-sea crust have been interpreted by the imprints left by the ejecta of supernova explosions occurring about 2-3 and 5-6 Myr ago. It is likely that the 60Fe peak at about 2-3 Myr originated from a supernova occurring in the Upper Centaurus Lupus association in Scorpius Centaurus (140 pc) or the Tucana Horologium association (70 pc). Whereas, the 5-6 Myr peak is likely attributed to the solar system's entrance into the bubble. In this Letter, we show that the supernova source responsible for synthesizing the 60Fe peak deposits 2-3 Myr ago was also likely a Galactic PeVatron source. We demonstrate that this supernova can consistently explain the "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum and the large-scale anisotropy between 100 TeV and 100 PeV. Matching the intensity and shape of the cosmic-ray spectrum allows us to place stringent constraints on the cosmic-ray energy content from the supernova as well as on the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient. Making use of such constraints we provide a robust estimate of the temporal variation of terrestrial ionizing cosmic radiation levels and discuss their implications in the development of early life on Earth by plausibly influencing the mutation rate and, as such, conceivably assisting in the evolution of complex organisms.</description>

      <title>Star cluster formation from turbulent clumps. IV. Protoplanetary disc evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars are born in the crowded environments of gradually forming star clusters. Dynamical interactions between close-passing stars and the evolving UV radiation fields from proximate massive stars are expected to sculpt the protoplanetary discs in these clusters, potentially contributing to the diversity of planetary systems that we observe. Here, we investigate the impact of cluster environment on disc demographics by implementing simple protoplanetary disc evolution models within $N$-body simulations of gradual star cluster formation. We consider a range of star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, and mass surface density of the natal cloud environment, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, both of which affect the overall duration of cluster formation. We track the interaction history of all stars to estimate the dynamical truncation of the discs around stars involved in close encounters. We also track external photoevaporation of the discs due to the ionizing radiation field of the nearby high- and intermediate-mass ($&gt; 5 M_\odot$) stars. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and the degree of primordial binarity have major influences on the masses and radii of the disc population. In particular, external photo-evaporation has a greater impact than dynamical interactions in determining the fate of discs in our clusters.</description>

      <title>Simulating Self-Lensing and Eclipsing Signals due to Detached Compact Objects in the TESS Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fraction of Galactic stars have compact companions which could be white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs) or stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). In a detached and edge-on binary system including a main-sequence star and a compact object (denoted by WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems), the stellar brightness can change periodically due to self-lensing or eclipsing features. The shape of a self-lensing signals is a degenerate function of stellar radius and compact object's mass because the self-lensing peak strongly depends on the projected source radius normalized to Einstein radius. Increasing the inclination angle $i$ changes the self-lensing shape from a strict top-hat model to one with slow-increasing edges. We simulate stellar light curves due to these binary systems which are observed by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope and evaluate the efficiencies to detect their periodic signatures using two sets of criteria (i)SNR$&gt;3$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}&gt;1$ (Low-Confidence, LC), and (ii) SNR$&gt;5$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}&gt;2$ (High-Confidence, HC). The HC efficiencies for detecting WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems with the inclination angle $i&lt;20^{\circ}$ during different time spans are $5$-$7\%$, $4.5$-$6\%$, and $4$-$5\%$, respectively. Detecting lensing-induced features is possible in only $\lesssim3\%$ and $\lesssim33\%$ of detectable WDMS and NSMS events. The detection efficiencies for closer source stars with higher priorities are higher and drop to zero for $b\gtrsim R_{\star}$, where $b\simeq \tan(i) a$ is the impact parameter($a$ is the semi-major axis). We predict the numbers of WDs, NSs, and SBHs that are discovered from the TESS Candidate Target List stars are $15$-$18$, $6$-$7$, and $&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Total Solar Irradiance during the last Millenium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar irradiance variations across various timescales, from minutes to centuries, represents a potential natural driver of past regional and global climate cold phases. To accurately assess the Sun's effect on climate, particularly during periods of exceptionally low solar activity known as grand minima, an accurate reconstruction of solar forcing is essential. While direct measurements of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) only began in the late 1970s with the advent of space radiometers, indirect evidence from various historical proxies suggests that the Sun's magnetic activity has undergone possible significant fluctuations over much longer timescales. Employing diverse and independent methods for TSI reconstruction is essential to gaining a comprehensive understanding of this issue. This study employs a semi-empirical model to reconstruct TSI over the past millennium. Our approach uses an estimated open solar magnetic field ($F_{o}$), derived from cosmogenic isotope data, as a proxy for solar activity. We reconstruct the cyclic variations of TSI, due to the solar surface magnetic features, by correlating $F_{o}$ with the parameter of active region functional form. Instead, we obtain the long-term TSI trend by applying the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm to the reconstructed $F_{o}$ to filter out the 11-year and 22-year solar variability. We prepare a reconstructed TSI record, spanning 971 to 2020 CE. The estimated departure from modern TSI values occurred during the Sp\"{o}rer Minimum (around 1400 CE), with a decrease of approximately 2.3 $W m^{-2}$. A slightly smaller decline of 2.2 $W m^{-2}$ is reported during the Maunder Minimum, between 1645 and 1715 CE.</description>

      <title>Radial Diffusion Driven by Spatially Localized ULF Waves in the Earth's Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves are critical drivers of particle acceleration and loss in the Earth's magnetosphere. While statistical models of ULF-induced radial transport have traditionally assumed that the waves are uniformly distributed across magnetic local time (MLT), decades of observational evidence show significant MLT localization of ULF waves in the Earth's magnetosphere. This study presents, for the first time, a quasi-linear radial diffusion coefficient accounting for localized ULF waves. We demonstrate that even though quasi-linear radial diffusion is averaged over drift orbits, MLT localization significantly alters the efficiency of particle transport. Our results reveal that when ULF waves cover more than 30\% of the MLT, the radial diffusion efficiency is comparable to that of uniform wave distributions. However, when ULF waves are confined within 10\% of the drift orbit, the diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 10 to 25\%, indicating that narrowly localized ULF waves are efficient drivers of radial transport.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million Main-Sequence FGK Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline. We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G &lt; 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.</description>

      <title>Second-generation planet formation after tidal disruption from common envelope evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that certain white dwarf (WD) planets, such as WD 1856+534 b, may form out of material from a stellar companion that tidally disrupts from common envelope (CE) evolution with the WD progenitor star. The disrupted companion shreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due to gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed stellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass companion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disk after tidal disruption is $\sim$$0.15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a new channel for producing second-generation planets around WDs.</description>

      <title>A synchronous moon as a possible cause of Mars' initial triaxiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14725v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses the possibility of a young Mars having had a massive moon, which synchronised the rotation of Mars, and gave Mars an initial asymmetric triaxiality to be later boosted by geological processes. It turns out that a moon of less than a third of the lunar mass was capable of producing a sufficient initial triaxiality. The asymmetry of the initial tidal shape of the equator depends on timing: the initial asymmetry is much stronger if the synchronous moon shows up already at the magma-ocean stage. From the moment of synchronisation of Mars' rotation with the moon's orbital motion, and until the moon was eliminated (as one possibility, by an impact in the beginning of the LHB), the moon was sustaining an early value of Mars' rotation rate.</description>
