      <title>Psychometrics for Hypnopaedia-Aware Machinery via Chaotic Projection of Artificial Mental Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural backdoors represent insidious cybersecurity loopholes that render learning machinery vulnerable to unauthorised manipulations, potentially enabling the weaponisation of artificial intelligence with catastrophic consequences. A backdoor attack involves the clandestine infiltration of a trigger during the learning process, metaphorically analogous to hypnopaedia, where ideas are implanted into a subject's subconscious mind under the state of hypnosis or unconsciousness. When activated by a sensory stimulus, the trigger evokes conditioned reflex that directs a machine to mount a predetermined response. In this study, we propose a cybernetic framework for constant surveillance of backdoors threats, driven by the dynamic nature of untrustworthy data sources. We develop a self-aware unlearning mechanism to autonomously detach a machine's behaviour from the backdoor trigger. Through reverse engineering and statistical inference, we detect deceptive patterns and estimate the likelihood of backdoor infection. We employ model inversion to elicit artificial mental imagery, using stochastic processes to disrupt optimisation pathways and avoid convergent but potentially flawed patterns. This is followed by hypothesis analysis, which estimates the likelihood of each potentially malicious pattern being the true trigger and infers the probability of infection. The primary objective of this study is to maintain a stable state of equilibrium between knowledge fidelity and backdoor vulnerability.</description>

      <title>AutoDAN-Turbo: A Lifelong Agent for Strategy Self-Exploration to Jailbreak LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo.</description>

      <title>Cyber Risk Taxonomies: Statistical Analysis of Cybersecurity Risk Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber risk classifications are widely used in the modeling of cyber event distributions, yet their effectiveness in out of sample forecasting performance remains underexplored. In this paper, we analyse the most commonly used classifications and argue in favour of switching the attention from goodness-of-fit and in-sample predictive performance, to focusing on the out-of sample forecasting performance. We use a rolling window analysis, to compare cyber risk distribution forecasts via threshold weighted scoring functions. Our results indicate that business motivated cyber risk classifications appear to be too restrictive and not flexible enough to capture the heterogeneity of cyber risk events. We investigate how dynamic and impact-based cyber risk classifiers seem to be better suited in forecasting future cyber risk losses than the other considered classifications. These findings suggest that cyber risk types provide limited forecasting ability concerning cyber event severity distribution, and cyber insurance ratemakers should utilize cyber risk types only when modeling the cyber event frequency distribution. Our study offers valuable insights for decision-makers and policymakers alike, contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the field of cyber risk management.</description>

      <title>Developing Assurance Cases for Adversarial Robustness and Regulatory Compliance in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to developing assurance cases for adversarial robustness and regulatory compliance in large language models (LLMs). Focusing on both natural and code language tasks, we explore the vulnerabilities these models face, including adversarial attacks based on jailbreaking, heuristics, and randomization. We propose a layered framework incorporating guardrails at various stages of LLM deployment, aimed at mitigating these attacks and ensuring compliance with the EU AI Act. Our approach includes a meta-layer for dynamic risk management and reasoning, crucial for addressing the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities. We illustrate our method with two exemplary assurance cases, highlighting how different contexts demand tailored strategies to ensure robust and compliant AI systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Assuring EU AI Act Compliance and Adversarial Robustness of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are prone to misuse and vulnerable to security threats, raising significant safety and security concerns. The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act seeks to enforce AI robustness in certain contexts, but faces implementation challenges due to the lack of standards, complexity of LLMs and emerging security vulnerabilities. Our research introduces a framework using ontologies, assurance cases, and factsheets to support engineers and stakeholders in understanding and documenting AI system compliance and security regarding adversarial robustness. This approach aims to ensure that LLMs adhere to regulatory standards and are equipped to counter potential threats.</description>

      <title>An Approach To Enhance IoT Security In 6G Networks Through Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication has evolved significantly, with 6G offering groundbreaking capabilities, particularly for IoT. However, the integration of IoT into 6G presents new security challenges, expanding the attack surface due to vulnerabilities introduced by advanced technologies such as open RAN, terahertz (THz) communication, IRS, massive MIMO, and AI. Emerging threats like AI exploitation, virtualization risks, and evolving attacks, including data manipulation and signal interference, further complicate security efforts. As 6G standards are set to be finalized by 2030, work continues to align security measures with technological advances. However, substantial gaps remain in frameworks designed to secure integrated IoT and 6G systems. Our research addresses these challenges by utilizing tree-based machine learning algorithms to manage complex datasets and evaluate feature importance. We apply data balancing techniques to ensure fair attack representation and use SHAP and LIME to improve model transparency. By aligning feature importance with XAI methods and cross-validating for consistency, we boost model accuracy and enhance IoT security within the 6G ecosystem.</description>

      <title>An Intelligent Native Network Slicing Security Architecture Empowered by Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) has transformed the landscape of resource sharing in networks, offering flexibility to support services and applications with highly variable requirements in areas such as the next-generation 5G/6G mobile networks (NGMN), vehicular networks, industrial Internet of Things (IoT), and verticals. Although significant research and experimentation have driven the development of network slicing, existing architectures often fall short in intrinsic architectural intelligent security capabilities. This paper proposes an architecture-intelligent security mechanism to improve the NS solutions. We idealized a security-native architecture that deploys intelligent microservices as federated agents based on machine learning, providing intra-slice and architectural operation security for the Slicing Future Internet Infrastructures (SFI2) reference architecture. It is noteworthy that federated learning approaches match the highly distributed modern microservice-based architectures, thus providing a unifying and scalable design choice for NS platforms addressing both service and security. Using ML-Agents and Security Agents, our approach identified Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and intrusion attacks within the slice using generic and non-intrusive telemetry records, achieving an average accuracy of approximately $95.60\%$ in the network slicing architecture and $99.99\%$ for the deployed slice -- intra-slice. This result demonstrates the potential for leveraging architectural operational security and introduces a promising new research direction for network slicing architectures.</description>

      <title>Taylor Unswift: Secured Weight Release for Large Language Models via Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of released large language models (LLMs) poses a significant dilemma, as existing mechanisms either compromise ownership rights or raise data privacy concerns. To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylor-series. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over 4x increase in latency, producing the tokens precisely matched with original LLMs. Subsequent defensive experiments further confirm that TaylorMLP effectively prevents users from reconstructing the weight values based on downstream datasets.</description>

      <title>A Global Cybersecurity Standardization Framework for Healthcare Informatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare has witnessed an increased digitalization in the post-COVID world. Technologies such as the medical internet of things and wearable devices are generating a plethora of data available on the cloud anytime from anywhere. This data can be analyzed using advanced artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, or even treatment of disease. This advancement comes with a major risk to protecting and securing protected health information (PHI). The prevailing regulations for preserving PHI are neither comprehensive nor easy to implement. The study first identifies twenty activities crucial for privacy and security, then categorizes them into five homogeneous categories namely: $\complement_1$ (Policy and Compliance Management), $\complement_2$ (Employee Training and Awareness), $\complement_3$ (Data Protection and Privacy Control), $\complement_4$ (Monitoring and Response), and $\complement_5$ (Technology and Infrastructure Security) and prioritizes these categories to provide a framework for the implementation of privacy and security in a wise manner. The framework utilized the Delphi Method to identify activities, criteria for categorization, and prioritization. Categorization is based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and prioritization is performed using a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The outcomes conclude that $\complement_3$ activities should be given first preference in implementation and followed by $\complement_1$ and $\complement_2$ activities. Finally, $\complement_4$ and $\complement_5$ should be implemented. The prioritized view of identified clustered healthcare activities related to security and privacy, are useful for healthcare policymakers and healthcare informatics professionals.</description>

      <title>TA3: Testing Against Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks are major threats to the deployment of machine learning (ML) models in many applications. Testing ML models against such attacks is becoming an essential step for evaluating and improving ML models. In this paper, we report the design and development of an interactive system for aiding the workflow of Testing Against Adversarial Attacks (TA3). In particular, with TA3, human-in-the-loop (HITL) enables human-steered attack simulation and visualization-assisted attack impact evaluation. While the current version of TA3 focuses on testing decision tree models against adversarial attacks based on the One Pixel Attack Method, it demonstrates the importance of HITL in ML testing and the potential application of HITL to the ML testing workflows for other types of ML models and other types of adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced AI applications have become increasingly available to a broad audience, e.g., as centrally managed large language models (LLMs). Such centralization is both a risk and a performance bottleneck - Edge AI promises to be a solution to these problems. However, its decentralized approach raises additional challenges regarding security and safety. In this paper, we argue that both of these aspects are critical for Edge AI, and even more so, their integration. Concretely, we survey security and safety threats, summarize existing countermeasures, and collect open challenges as a call for more research in this area.</description>

      <title>Towards the generation of hierarchical attack models from cybersecurity vulnerabilities using language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of a pre-trained language model and siamese network to discern sibling relationships between text-based cybersecurity vulnerability data. The ultimate purpose of the approach presented in this paper is towards the construction of hierarchical attack models based on a set of text descriptions characterising potential/observed vulnerabilities in a given system. Due to the nature of the data, and the uncertainty sensitive environment in which the problem is presented, a practically oriented soft computing approach is necessary. Therefore, a key focus of this work is to investigate practical questions surrounding the reliability of predicted links towards the construction of such models, to which end conceptual and practical challenges and solutions associated with the proposed approach are outlined, such as dataset complexity and stability of predictions. Accordingly, the contributions of this paper focus on producing neural networks using a pre-trained language model for predicting sibling relationships between cybersecurity vulnerabilities, then outlining how to apply this capability towards the generation of hierarchical attack models. In addition, two data sampling mechanisms for tackling data complexity, and a consensus mechanism for reducing the amount of false positive predictions are outlined. Each of these approaches is compared and contrasted using empirical results from three sets of cybersecurity data to determine their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>STOP! Camera Spoofing via the in-Vehicle IP Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) rely on cameras to control the driving. In many prior approaches an attacker aiming to stop the vehicle had to send messages on the specialized and better-defended CAN bus. We suggest an easier alternative: manipulate the IP-based network communication between the camera and the ADAS logic, inject fake images of stop signs or red lights into the video stream, and let the ADAS stop the car safely. We created an attack tool that successfully exploits the GigE Vision protocol.
  Then we analyze two classes of passive anomaly detectors to identify such attacks: protocol-based detectors and video-based detectors. We implemented multiple detectors of both classes and evaluated them on data collected from our test vehicle and also on data from the public BDD corpus. Our results show that such detectors are effective against naive adversaries, but sophisticated adversaries can evade detection.
  Finally, we propose a novel class of active defense mechanisms that randomly adjust camera parameters during the video transmission, and verify that the received images obey the requested adjustments. Within this class we focus on a specific implementation, the width-varying defense, which randomly modifies the width of every frame. Beyond its function as an anomaly detector, this defense is also a protective measure against certain attacks: by distorting injected image patches it prevents their recognition by the ADAS logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the width-varying defense through theoretical analysis and by an extensive evaluation of several types of attack in a wide range of realistic road driving conditions. The best the attack was able to achieve against this defense was injecting a stop sign for a duration of 0.2 seconds, with a success probability of 0.2%, whereas stopping a vehicle requires about 2.5 seconds.</description>

      <title>Aligning LLMs to Be Robust Against Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern software systems, interfacing between the user and the internet to assist with tasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks, the LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval, results from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to manipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be carefully crafted and injected into external data sources to override the user's intended instruction and instead execute a malicious instruction. Prompt injection attacks constitute a major threat to LLM security, making the design and implementation of practical countermeasures of paramount importance. To this end, we show that alignment can be a powerful tool to make LLMs more robust against prompt injection. Our method -- SecAlign -- first builds an alignment dataset by simulating prompt injection attacks and constructing pairs of desirable and undesirable responses. Then, we apply existing alignment techniques to fine-tune the LLM to be robust against these simulated attacks. Our experiments show that SecAlign robustifies the LLM substantially with a negligible hurt on model utility. Moreover, SecAlign's protection generalizes to strong attacks unseen in training. Specifically, the success rate of state-of-the-art GCG-based prompt injections drops from 56% to 2% in Mistral-7B after our alignment process. Our code is released at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SecAlign</description>

      <title>Image Watermarks are Removable Using Controllable Regeneration from Clean Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image watermark techniques provide an effective way to assert ownership, deter misuse, and trace content sources, which has become increasingly essential in the era of large generative models. A critical attribute of watermark techniques is their robustness against various manipulations. In this paper, we introduce a watermark removal approach capable of effectively nullifying the state of the art watermarking techniques. Our primary insight involves regenerating the watermarked image starting from a clean Gaussian noise via a controllable diffusion model, utilizing the extracted semantic and spatial features from the watermarked image. The semantic control adapter and the spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising process towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the cleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off between watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose an adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying numbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image, followed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent representation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent representation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the desired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various watermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer superior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance compared to existing regeneration approaches.</description>

      <title>Privacy Vulnerabilities in Marginals-based Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When acting as a privacy-enhancing technology, synthetic data generation (SDG) aims to maintain a resemblance to the real data while excluding personally-identifiable information. Many SDG algorithms provide robust differential privacy (DP) guarantees to this end. However, we show that the strongest class of SDG algorithms--those that preserve \textit{marginal probabilities}, or similar statistics, from the underlying data--leak information about individuals that can be recovered more efficiently than previously understood. We demonstrate this by presenting a novel membership inference attack, MAMA-MIA, and evaluate it against three seminal DP SDG algorithms: MST, PrivBayes, and Private-GSD. MAMA-MIA leverages knowledge of which SDG algorithm was used, allowing it to learn information about the hidden data more accurately, and orders-of-magnitude faster, than other leading attacks. We use MAMA-MIA to lend insight into existing SDG vulnerabilities. Our approach went on to win the first SNAKE (SaNitization Algorithm under attacK ... $\varepsilon$) competition.</description>

      <title>Cyber Threats to Canadian Federal Election: Emerging Threats, Assessment, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Canada prepares for the 2025 federal election, ensuring the integrity and security of the electoral process against cyber threats is crucial. Recent foreign interference in elections globally highlight the increasing sophistication of adversaries in exploiting technical and human vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities also exist in Canada's electoral system that relies on a complex network of IT systems, vendors, and personnel. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, a threat assessment is crucial to identify emerging threats, develop incident response capabilities, and build public trust and resilience against cyber threats. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive national cyber threat assessment, following the NIST Special Publication 800-30 framework, focusing on identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks to the upcoming 2025 Canadian federal election. The research identifies three major threats: misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation (MDM) campaigns; attacks on critical infrastructure and election support systems; and espionage by malicious actors. Through detailed analysis, the assessment offers insights into the capabilities, intent, and potential impact of these threats. The paper also discusses emerging technologies and their influence on election security and proposes a multi-faceted approach to risk mitigation ahead of the election.</description>

      <title>TaeBench: Improving Quality of Toxic Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxicity text detectors can be vulnerable to adversarial examples - small perturbations to input text that fool the systems into wrong detection. Existing attack algorithms are time-consuming and often produce invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, making them less useful for evaluating or improving real-world toxicity content moderators. This paper proposes an annotation pipeline for quality control of generated toxic adversarial examples (TAE). We design model-based automated annotation and human-based quality verification to assess the quality requirements of TAE. Successful TAE should fool a target toxicity model into making benign predictions, be grammatically reasonable, appear natural like human-generated text, and exhibit semantic toxicity. When applying these requirements to more than 20 state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAE attack recipes, we find many invalid samples from a total of 940k raw TAE attack generations. We then utilize the proposed pipeline to filter and curate a high-quality TAE dataset we call TaeBench (of size 264k). Empirically, we demonstrate that TaeBench can effectively transfer-attack SOTA toxicity content moderation models and services. Our experiments also show that TaeBench with adversarial training achieve significant improvements of the robustness of two toxicity detectors.</description>

      <title>A Blockchain-Enhanced Framework for Privacy and Data Integrity in Crowdsourced Drone Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an innovative framework that integrates consumer-grade drones into bushfire management, addressing both service improvement and data privacy concerns under Australia's Privacy Act 1988. This system establishes a marketplace where bushfire management authorities, as data consumers, access critical information from drone operators, who serve as data providers. The framework employs local differential privacy to safeguard the privacy of data providers from all system entities, ensuring compliance with privacy standards. Additionally, a blockchain-based solution facilitates fair data and fee exchanges while maintaining immutable records for enhanced accountability. Validated through a proof-of-concept implementation, the framework's scalability and adaptability make it well-suited for large-scale, real-world applications in bushfire management.</description>

      <title>KnowledgeSG: Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Text Generation with Knowledge Distillation from Server</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05725v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) facilitate many parties to fine-tune LLMs on their own private data. However, this practice raises privacy concerns due to the memorization of LLMs. Existing solutions, such as utilizing synthetic data for substitution, struggle to simultaneously improve performance and preserve privacy. They either rely on a local model for generation, resulting in a performance decline, or take advantage of APIs, directly exposing the data to API servers. To address this issue, we propose KnowledgeSG, a novel client-server framework which enhances synthetic data quality and improves model performance while ensuring privacy. We achieve this by learning local knowledge from the private data with differential privacy (DP) and distilling professional knowledge from the server. Additionally, inspired by federated learning, we transmit models rather than data between the client and server to prevent privacy leakage. Extensive experiments in medical and financial domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KnowledgeSG. Our code is now publicly available at https://github.com/wwh0411/KnowledgeSG.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Deep Neural Networks in the Hard-Label Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are valuable assets, yet their public accessibility raises security concerns about parameter extraction by malicious actors. Recent work by Carlini et al. (crypto'20) and Canales-Mart\'inez et al. (eurocrypt'24) has drawn parallels between this issue and block cipher key extraction via chosen plaintext attacks. Leveraging differential cryptanalysis, they demonstrated that all the weights and biases of black-box ReLU-based DNNs could be inferred using a polynomial number of queries and computational time. However, their attacks relied on the availability of the exact numeric value of output logits, which allowed the calculation of their derivatives. To overcome this limitation, Chen et al. (asiacrypt'24) tackled the more realistic hard-label scenario, where only the final classification label (e.g., "dog" or "car") is accessible to the attacker. They proposed an extraction method requiring a polynomial number of queries but an exponential execution time. In addition, their approach was applicable only to a restricted set of architectures, could deal only with binary classifiers, and was demonstrated only on tiny neural networks with up to four neurons split among up to two hidden layers. This paper introduces new techniques that, for the first time, achieve cryptanalytic extraction of DNN parameters in the most challenging hard-label setting, using both a polynomial number of queries and polynomial time. We validate our approach by extracting nearly one million parameters from a DNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 832 neurons in four hidden layers. Our results reveal the surprising fact that all the weights of a ReLU-based DNN can be efficiently determined by analyzing only the geometric shape of its decision boundaries.</description>

      <title>StagedVulBERT: Multi-Granular Vulnerability Detection with a Novel Pre-trained Code Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of pre-trained model-based vulnerability detection methods has significantly advanced the field of automated vulnerability detection. However, these methods still face several challenges, such as difficulty in learning effective feature representations of statements for fine-grained predictions and struggling to process overly long code sequences. To address these issues, this study introduces StagedVulBERT, a novel vulnerability detection framework that leverages a pre-trained code language model and employs a coarse-to-fine strategy. The key innovation and contribution of our research lies in the development of the CodeBERT-HLS component within our framework, specialized in hierarchical, layered, and semantic encoding. This component is designed to capture semantics at both the token and statement levels simultaneously, which is crucial for achieving more accurate multi-granular vulnerability detection. Additionally, CodeBERT-HLS efficiently processes longer code token sequences, making it more suited to real-world vulnerability detection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of vulnerability detection at both coarse- and fine-grained levels. Specifically, in coarse-grained vulnerability detection, StagedVulBERT achieves an F1 score of 92.26%, marking a 6.58% improvement over the best-performing methods. At the fine-grained level, our method achieves a Top-5% accuracy of 65.69%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 75.17%.</description>

      <title>CALoR: Towards Comprehensive Model Inversion Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) aim at recovering privacy-sensitive training data from the knowledge encoded in the released machine learning models. Recent advances in the MIA field have significantly enhanced the attack performance under multiple scenarios, posing serious privacy risks of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the development of defense strategies against MIAs is relatively backward to resist the latest MIAs and existing defenses fail to achieve further trade-off between model utility and model robustness. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of intrinsic vulnerabilities of MIAs, comprehensively uncovering the weaknesses inherent in the basic pipeline, which are partially investigated in the previous defenses. Building upon these new insights, we propose a robust defense mechanism, integrating Confidence Adaptation and Low-Rank compression(CALoR). Our method includes a novel robustness-enhanced classification loss specially-designed for model inversion defenses and reveals the extraordinary effectiveness of compressing the classification header. With CALoR, we can mislead the optimization objective, reduce the leaked information and impede the backpropagation of MIAs, thus mitigating the risk of privacy leakage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense performance against MIAs and exhibits superior generalization to existing defenses across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fortify Your Foundations: Practical Privacy and Security for Foundation Model Deployments In The Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) display exceptional performance in tasks such as natural language processing and are being applied across a growing range of disciplines. Although typically trained on large public datasets, FMs are often fine-tuned or integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which rely on private data. This access, along with their size and costly training, heightens the risk of intellectual property theft. Moreover, multimodal FMs may expose sensitive information. In this work, we examine the FM threat model and discuss the practicality and comprehensiveness of various approaches for securing against them, such as ML-based methods and trusted execution environments (TEEs). We demonstrate that TEEs offer an effective balance between strong security properties, usability, and performance. Specifically, we present a solution achieving less than 10\% overhead versus bare metal for the full Llama2 7B and 13B inference pipelines running inside \intel\ SGX and \intel\ TDX. We also share our configuration files and insights from our implementation. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show the practicality of TEEs for securing FMs.</description>

      <title>Chameleon: An Efficient FHE Scheme Switching Acceleration on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables direct computation on encrypted data, making it a crucial technology for privacy protection. However, FHE suffers from significant performance bottlenecks. In this context, GPU acceleration offers a promising solution to bridge the performance gap. Existing efforts primarily focus on single-class FHE schemes, which fail to meet the diverse requirements of data types and functions, prompting the development of hybrid multi-class FHE schemes. However, studies have yet to thoroughly investigate specific GPU optimizations for hybrid FHE schemes.
  In this paper, we present an efficient GPU-based FHE scheme switching acceleration named Chameleon. First, we propose a scalable NTT acceleration design that adapts to larger CKKS polynomials and smaller TFHE polynomials. Specifically, Chameleon tackles synchronization issues by fusing stages to reduce synchronization, employing polynomial coefficient shuffling to minimize synchronization scale, and utilizing an SM-aware combination strategy to identify the optimal switching point. Second, Chameleon is the first to comprehensively analyze and optimize critical switching operations. It introduces CMux-level parallelization to accelerate LUT evaluation and a homomorphic rotation-free matrix-vector multiplication to improve repacking efficiency. Finally, Chameleon outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU implementations by 1.23x in CKKS HMUL and 1.15x in bootstrapping. It also achieves up to 4.87x and 1.51x speedups for TFHE gate bootstrapping compared to CPU and GPU versions, respectively, and delivers a 67.3x average speedup for scheme switching over CPU-based implementation.</description>

      <title>Data Quality Issues in Vulnerability Detection Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging task to identify potential weaknesses in software for cyber security. Recently, deep learning (DL) has made great progress in automating the detection process. Due to the complex multi-layer structure and a large number of parameters, a DL model requires massive labeled (vulnerable or secure) source code to gain knowledge to effectively distinguish between vulnerable and secure code. In the literature, many datasets have been created to train DL models for this purpose. However, these datasets suffer from several issues that will lead to low detection accuracy of DL models. In this paper, we define three critical issues (i.e., data imbalance, low vulnerability coverage, biased vulnerability distribution) that can significantly affect the model performance and three secondary issues (i.e., errors in source code, mislabeling, noisy historical data) that also affect the performance but can be addressed through a dedicated pre-processing procedure. In addition, we conduct a study of 14 papers along with 54 datasets for vulnerability detection to confirm these defined issues. Furthermore, we discuss good practices to use existing datasets and to create new ones.</description>

      <title>The GDPR's Rules on Data Breaches: Analysing Their Rationales and Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires an organisation that suffers a data breach to notify the competent Data Protection Authority. The organisation must also inform the relevant individuals, when a data breach threatens their rights and freedoms. This paper focuses on the following question: given the goals of the GDPR's data breach notification obligation, and we assess the obligation in the light of those goals. We refer to insights from information security and economics, and present them in a reader-friendly way for lawyers. Our main conclusion is that the GDPR's data breach rules are likely to contribute to the goals. For instance, the data breach notification obligation can nudge organisations towards better security; such an obligation enables regulators to perform their duties; and such an obligation improves transparency and accountability. However, the paper also warns that we should not have unrealistic expectations of the possibilities for people to protect their interests after a data breach notice. Likewise, we should not have high expectations of people switching to other service providers after receiving a data breach notification. Lastly, the paper calls for Data Protection Authorities to publish more information about reported data breaches. Such information can help to analyse security threats.</description>

      <title>blockLAW: Blockchain Technology for Legal Automation and Workflow -- Cyber Ethics and Cybersecurity Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current legal environment, it is essential to prioritize the protection and reliability of data to promote trust and effectiveness. This study examines how blockchain technology in the form of blockLAW can be applicable to investigate its effects on legal automation, cybersecurity, and ethical concerns. The decentralized ledger and unchangeable characteristics of Blockchain provide opportunities to simplify legal procedures, automate contract execution with smart contracts, and improve transparency in legal transactions. Blockchain is seen as a crucial instrument for updating legal processes while maintaining ethical standards, tackling issues like scalability, regulatory adherence, and ethical dilemmas such as privacy and fairness. The study examines recent developments and evaluates blockchain impact on legal structures, offering perspectives on its potential to enhance legal procedures and guarantee transparency in legal systems. It further emphasizes blockchain ability to redefine how legal professionals handle and protect sensitive information, leading to stronger, more effective, and reliable legal procedures. We have also discussed the technological considerations when it comes to blockchain integration into legal systems like integration planning, implementation strategies, innovations, advancements, trends with Blockchain Integration Framework for legal systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Android Malware by Visualizing App Behaviors from Multiple Complementary Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising technology for achieving Android malware detection. To further unleash its detection potentials, software visualization can be integrated for analyzing the details of app behaviors clearly. However, facing increasingly sophisticated malware, existing visualization-based methods, analyzing from one or randomly-selected few views, can only detect limited attack types. We propose and implement LensDroid, a novel technique that detects Android malware by visualizing app behaviors from multiple complementary views. Our goal is to harness the power of combining deep learning and software visualization to automatically capture and aggregate high-level features that are not inherently linked, thereby revealing hidden maliciousness of Android app behaviors. To thoroughly comprehend the details of apps, we visualize app behaviors from three related but distinct views of behavioral sensitivities, operational contexts and supported environments. We then extract high-order semantics based on the views accordingly. To exploit semantic complementarity of the views, we design a deep neural network based model for fusing the visualized features from local to global based on their contributions to downstream tasks. A comprehensive comparison with five baseline techniques is performed on datasets of more than 51K apps in three real-world typical scenarios, including overall threats, app evolution and zero-day malware. The experimental results show that the overall performance of LensDroid is better than the baseline techniques. We also validate the complementarity of the views and demonstrate that the multi-view fusion in LensDroid enhances Android malware detection.</description>

      <title>SC-Bench: A Large-Scale Dataset for Smart Contract Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a huge demand to ensure the compliance of smart contracts listed on blockchain platforms to safety and economic standards. Today, manual efforts in the form of auditing are commonly used to achieve this goal. ML-based automated techniques have the promise to alleviate human efforts and the resulting monetary costs. However, unlike other domains where ML techniques have had huge successes, no systematic ML techniques have been proposed or applied to smart contract auditing. We present SC-Bench, the first dataset for automated smart-contract auditing research. SC-Bench consists of 5,377 real-world smart contracts running on Ethereum, a widely used blockchain platform, and 15,975 violations of standards on Ehereum called ERCs. Out of these violations, 139 are real violations programmers made. The remaining are errors we systematically injected to reflect the violations of different ERC rules. We evaluate SC-Bench using GPT-4 by prompting it with both the contracts and ERC rules. In addition, we manually identify each violated rule and the corresponding code site (i.e., oracle) and prompt GPT-4 with the information asking for a True-or-False question. Our results show that without the oracle, GPT-4 can only detect 0.9% violations, and with the oracle, it detects 22.9% violations. These results show the potential room for improvement in ML-based techniques for smart-contract auditing.</description>

      <title>The Last Iterate Advantage: Empirical Auditing and Principled Heuristic Analysis of Differentially Private SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06186v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple heuristic privacy analysis of noisy clipped stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) in the setting where only the last iterate is released and the intermediate iterates remain hidden. Namely, our heuristic assumes a linear structure for the model.
  We show experimentally that our heuristic is predictive of the outcome of privacy auditing applied to various training procedures. Thus it can be used prior to training as a rough estimate of the final privacy leakage. We also probe the limitations of our heuristic by providing some artificial counterexamples where it underestimates the privacy leakage.
  The standard composition-based privacy analysis of DP-SGD effectively assumes that the adversary has access to all intermediate iterates, which is often unrealistic. However, this analysis remains the state of the art in practice. While our heuristic does not replace a rigorous privacy analysis, it illustrates the large gap between the best theoretical upper bounds and the privacy auditing lower bounds and sets a target for further work to improve the theoretical privacy analyses. We also empirically support our heuristic and show existing privacy auditing attacks are bounded by our heuristic analysis in both vision and language tasks.</description>

      <title>Near Exact Privacy Amplification for Matrix Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing the privacy parameters for DP machine learning when using privacy amplification via random batching and noise correlated across rounds via a correlation matrix $\textbf{C}$ (i.e., the matrix mechanism). Past work on this problem either only applied to banded $\textbf{C}$, or gave loose privacy parameters. In this work, we give a framework for computing near-exact privacy parameters for any lower-triangular, non-negative $\textbf{C}$. Our framework allows us to optimize the correlation matrix $\textbf{C}$ while accounting for amplification, whereas past work could not. Empirically, we show this lets us achieve smaller RMSE on prefix sums than the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA). We also show that we can improve on the SOTA performance on deep learning tasks. Our two main technical tools are (i) using Monte Carlo accounting to bypass composition, which was the main technical challenge for past work, and (ii) a "balls-in-bins" batching scheme that enables easy privacy analysis and is closer to practical random batching than Poisson sampling.</description>

      <title>Multi-label Classification for Android Malware Based on Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing malware classification approaches (i.e., binary and family classification) can barely benefit subsequent analysis with their outputs. Even the family classification approaches suffer from lacking a formal naming standard and an incomplete definition of malicious behaviors. More importantly, the existing approaches are powerless for one malware with multiple malicious behaviors, while this is a very common phenomenon for Android malware in the wild. So, neither of them can provide researchers with a direct and comprehensive enough understanding of malware. In this paper, we propose MLCDroid, an ML-based multi-label classification approach that can directly indicate the existence of pre-defined malicious behaviors. With an in-depth analysis, we summarize six basic malicious behaviors from real-world malware with security reports and construct a labeled dataset. We compare the results of 70 algorithm combinations to evaluate the effectiveness (best at 73.3%). Faced with the challenge of the expensive cost of data annotation, we further propose an active learning approach based on data augmentation, which can improve the overall accuracy to 86.7% with a data augmentation of 5,000+ high-quality samples from an unlabeled malware dataset. This is the first multi-label Android malware classification approach intending to provide more information on fine-grained malicious behaviors.</description>

      <title>Hallucinating AI Hijacking Attack: Large Language Models and Malicious Code Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research builds and evaluates the adversarial potential to introduce copied code or hallucinated AI recommendations for malicious code in popular code repositories. While foundational large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic guard against both harmful behaviors and toxic strings, previous work on math solutions that embed harmful prompts demonstrate that the guardrails may differ between expert contexts. These loopholes would appear in mixture of expert's models when the context of the question changes and may offer fewer malicious training examples to filter toxic comments or recommended offensive actions. The present work demonstrates that foundational models may refuse to propose destructive actions correctly when prompted overtly but may unfortunately drop their guard when presented with a sudden change of context, like solving a computer programming challenge. We show empirical examples with trojan-hosting repositories like GitHub, NPM, NuGet, and popular content delivery networks (CDN) like jsDelivr which amplify the attack surface. In the LLM's directives to be helpful, example recommendations propose application programming interface (API) endpoints which a determined domain-squatter could acquire and setup attack mobile infrastructure that triggers from the naively copied code. We compare this attack to previous work on context-shifting and contrast the attack surface as a novel version of "living off the land" attacks in the malware literature. In the latter case, foundational language models can hijack otherwise innocent user prompts to recommend actions that violate their owners' safety policies when posed directly without the accompanying coding support request.</description>

      <title>WAPITI: A Watermark for Finetuned Open-Source LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking of large language models (LLMs) generation embeds an imperceptible statistical pattern within texts, making it algorithmically detectable. Watermarking is a promising method for addressing potential harm and biases from LLMs, as it enables traceability, accountability, and detection of manipulated content, helping to mitigate unintended consequences. However, for open-source models, watermarking faces two major challenges: (i) incompatibility with fine-tuned models, and (ii) vulnerability to fine-tuning attacks. In this work, we propose WAPITI, a new method that transfers watermarking from base models to fine-tuned models through parameter integration. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first watermark for fine-tuned open-source LLMs that preserves their fine-tuned capabilities. Furthermore, our approach offers an effective defense against fine-tuning attacks. We test our method on various model architectures and watermarking strategies. Results demonstrate that our method can successfully inject watermarks and is highly compatible with fine-tuned models. Additionally, we offer an in-depth analysis of how parameter editing influences the watermark strength and overall capabilities of the resulting models.</description>

      <title>MORSE: An Efficient Homomorphic Secret Sharing Scheme Enabling Non-Linear Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) enables two servers to locally perform functions on encrypted data directly and obtain the results in the form of shares. A Paillier-based HSS solution seamlessly achieves multiplicative homomorphism and consumes less communication costs. Unfortunately, existing Paillier-based HSS schemes suffer from a large private key size, potential calculation error, expensive computation and storage overhead, and only valid on linear operations (e.g., addition and multiplication). To this end, inspired by the Paillier cryptosystem with fast encryption and decryption, we propose MORSE, an efficient homomorphic secret sharing scheme enabling non-linear operation, which enjoys a small key size, no calculation error and low overhead. In terms of functions, MORSE supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar-multiplication, and comparison. Particularly, we carefully design two conversion protocols achieving the mutual conversion between one Paillier ciphertext and two secret shares, which allows MORSE to continuously perform the above operations. Rigorous analyses demonstrate that MORSE securely outputs correct results. Experimental results show that MORSE makes a runtime improvement of up to 9.3 times in terms of secure multiplication, and a communication costs reduction of up to 16.6% in secure comparison, compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>On the Security of Bitstream-level JPEG Encryption with Restart Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to evaluate the security of a bitstream-level JPEG encryption method using restart (RST) markers, where encrypted image can keep the JPEG file format with the same file size as non-encrypted image. Data encrypted using this method can be decoded without altering header information by employing a standard JPEG decoder. Moreover, the use of RST markers enables the definition of extended blocks divided by the markers, so spatially partial encryption and block-permutation-based encryption can be carried out. However, the security of the method was evaluated only with respect to the key space analysis for brute-force attacks and other limited attacks. Accordingly, in this paper, we evaluated the security of the method with respect to robustness against ciphertext-only attacks including state-of-the-art attacks. In experiments, the method is compared with conventional encryption methods, and it is confirmed to be robust against ciphertext-only attacks if parameters used for image encryption are carefully chosen.</description>

      <title>Gumbel Rao Monte Carlo based Bi-Modal Neural Architecture Search for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfakes pose a critical threat to biometric authentication systems by generating highly realistic synthetic media. Existing multimodal deepfake detectors often struggle to adapt to diverse data and rely on simple fusion methods. To address these challenges, we propose Gumbel-Rao Monte Carlo Bi-modal Neural Architecture Search (GRMC-BMNAS), a novel architecture search framework that employs Gumbel-Rao Monte Carlo sampling to optimize multimodal fusion. It refines the Straight through Gumbel Softmax (STGS) method by reducing variance with Rao-Blackwellization, stabilizing network training. Using a two-level search approach, the framework optimizes the network architecture, parameters, and performance. Crucial features are efficiently identified from backbone networks, while within the cell structure, a weighted fusion operation integrates information from various sources. By varying parameters such as temperature and number of Monte carlo samples yields an architecture that maximizes classification performance and better generalisation capability. Experimental results on the FakeAVCeleb and SWAN-DF datasets demonstrate an impressive AUC percentage of 95.4\%, achieved with minimal model parameters.</description>

      <title>Signal Watermark on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly sophisticated, they raise significant security concerns, including the creation of fake news and academic misuse. Most detectors for identifying model-generated text are limited by their reliance on variance in perplexity and burstiness, and they require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we proposed a watermarking method embedding a specific watermark into the text during its generation by LLMs, based on a pre-defined signal pattern. This technique not only ensures the watermark's invisibility to humans but also maintains the quality and grammatical integrity of model-generated text. We utilize LLMs and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for token probability computation and detection of the signal watermark. The unique application of signal processing principles within the realm of text generation by LLMs allows for subtle yet effective embedding of watermarks, which do not compromise the quality or coherence of the generated text. Our method has been empirically validated across multiple LLMs, consistently maintaining high detection accuracy, even with variations in temperature settings during text generation. In the experiment of distinguishing between human-written and watermarked text, our method achieved an AUROC score of 0.97, significantly outperforming existing methods like GPTZero, which scored 0.64. The watermark's resilience to various attacking scenarios further confirms its robustness, addressing significant challenges in model-generated text authentication.</description>

      <title>Bots can Snoop: Uncovering and Mitigating Privacy Risks of Bots in Group Chats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New privacy concerns arise with chatbots on group messaging platforms. Chatbots may access information beyond their intended functionalities, such as messages unintended for chatbots or sender's identities. Chatbot operators may exploit such information to infer personal information and link users across groups, potentially leading to personal data breaches, pervasive tracking, and targeted advertising. Our analysis of conversation datasets shows that (1) chatbots often access far more messages than needed, and (2) when a user joins a new group with chatbots, there is a 3.4% chance that at least one of the chatbots can recognize and associate the user with their previous interactions in other groups. Although state-of-the-art group messaging protocols provide robust end-to-end security and some platforms have implemented policies to limit chatbot access, no platforms successfully combine these features. This paper introduces SnoopGuard, a secure group messaging protocol that ensures user privacy against chatbots while maintaining strong end-to-end security. Our method offers selective message access, preventing chatbots from accessing unrelated messages, and ensures sender anonymity within the group. SnoopGuard achieves $O(\log n + m)$ message-sending complexity for a group of $n$ users and $m$ chatbots, compared to $O(\log(n + m))$ in state-of-the-art protocols, with acceptable overhead for enhanced privacy. Our prototype implementation shows that sending a message in a group of 50 users and 10 chatbots takes about 30 milliseconds when integrated with Message Layer Security (MLS).</description>

      <title>How hard can it be? Quantifying MITRE attack campaigns with attack trees and cATM logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of cyber threats grows more complex by the day. Advanced Persistent Threats carry out systematic attack campaigns against which cybersecurity practitioners must defend. Examples of such organized attacks are operations Dream Job, Wocao, WannaCry or the SolarWinds Compromise. To evaluate which risks are most threatening, and which campaigns to prioritize against when defending, cybersecurity experts must be equipped with the right toolbox. In particular, they must be able to (a) obtain likelihood values for each attack campaign recorded in the wild and (b) reliably and transparently operationalize these values to carry out quantitative comparisons among campaigns. This will allow security experts to perform quantitatively-informed decision making that is transparent and accountable. In this paper we construct such a framework by: (1) quantifying the likelihood of attack campaigns via data-driven procedures on the MITRE knowledge base and (2) introducing a methodology for automatic modelling of MITRE intelligence data: this is complete in the sense that it captures any attack campaign via template attack tree models. (3) We further propose a computational framework to carry out this comparisons based on the cATM formal logic, and implement this into an open-source Python tool. Finally, we validate our approach by quantifying the likelihood of all MITRE campaigns, and comparing the likelihood of the Wocao and Dream Job MITRE campaigns -- generated with our proposed approach -- against "ad hoc" traditionally-built attack tree models, demonstrating how our methodology is substantially lighter in modelling effort, and still capable of capturing all the quantitative relevant data.</description>

      <title>MERGE: Matching Electronic Results with Genuine Evidence for verifiable voting in person at remote locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06705v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overseas military personnel often face significant challenges in participating in elections due to the slow pace of traditional mail systems, which can result in ballots missing crucial deadlines. While internet-based voting offers a faster alternative, it introduces serious risks to the integrity and privacy of the voting process. We introduce the MERGE protocol to address these issues by combining the speed of electronic ballot delivery with the reliability of paper returns. This protocol allows voters to submit an electronic record of their vote quickly while simultaneously mailing a paper ballot for verification. The electronic record can be used for preliminary results, but the paper ballot is used in a Risk Limiting Audit (RLA) if received in time, ensuring the integrity of the election. This approach extends the time window for ballot arrival without undermining the security and accuracy of the vote count.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Questions! Towards Backdoor Attacks on Text-to-Visualization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06782v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-visualization (text-to-vis) models have become valuable tools in the era of big data, enabling users to generate data visualizations and make informed decisions through natural language queries (NLQs). Despite their widespread application, the security vulnerabilities of these models have been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose VisPoison, a novel framework designed to identify these vulnerabilities of current text-to-vis models systematically. VisPoison introduces two types of triggers that activate three distinct backdoor attacks, potentially leading to data exposure, misleading visualizations, or denial-of-service (DoS) incidents. The framework features both proactive and passive attack mechanisms: proactive attacks leverage rare-word triggers to access confidential data, while passive attacks, triggered unintentionally by users, exploit a first-word trigger method, causing errors or DoS events in visualizations. Through extensive experiments on both trainable and in-context learning (ICL)-based text-to-vis models, \textit{VisPoison} achieves attack success rates of over 90\%, highlighting the security problem of current text-to-vis models. Additionally, we explore two types of defense mechanisms against these attacks, but the results show that existing countermeasures are insufficient, underscoring the pressing need for more robust security solutions in text-to-vis systems.</description>

      <title>Diffuse or Confuse: A Diffusion Deepfake Speech Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have significantly improved synthetic speech generation. This paper explores diffusion models, a novel method for creating realistic synthetic speech. We create a diffusion dataset using available tools and pretrained models. Additionally, this study assesses the quality of diffusion-generated deepfakes versus non-diffusion ones and their potential threat to current deepfake detection systems. Findings indicate that the detection of diffusion-based deepfakes is generally comparable to non-diffusion deepfakes, with some variability based on detector architecture. Re-vocoding with diffusion vocoders shows minimal impact, and the overall speech quality is comparable to non-diffusion methods.</description>

      <title>On Wagner's k-Tree Algorithm Over Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06856v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The k-Tree algorithm [Wagner 02] is a non-trivial algorithm for the average-case k-SUM problem that has found widespread use in cryptanalysis. Its input consists of k lists, each containing n integers from a range of size m. Wagner's original heuristic analysis suggested that this algorithm succeeds with constant probability if n = m^{1/(\log{k}+1)}, and that in this case it runs in time O(kn). Subsequent rigorous analysis of the algorithm [Lyubashevsky 05, Shallue 08, Joux-Kippen-Loss 24] has shown that it succeeds with high probability if the input list sizes are significantly larger than this.
  We present a broader rigorous analysis of the k-Tree algorithm, showing upper and lower bounds on its success probability and complexity for any size of the input lists. Our results confirm Wagner's heuristic conclusions, and also give meaningful bounds for a wide range of list sizes that are not covered by existing analyses. We present analytical bounds that are asymptotically tight, as well as an efficient algorithm that computes (provably correct) bounds for a wide range of concrete parameter settings. We also do the same for the k-Tree algorithm over Z_m. Finally, we present experimental evaluation of the tightness of our results.</description>

Abstract: We consider differentially private counting when each data point consists of $d$ bits satisfying a partial order. Our main technical contribution is a problem-specific $K$-norm mechanism that runs in time $O(d^2)$. Experiments show that, depending on the partial order in question, our solution dominates existing pure differentially private mechanisms, and can reduce their error by an order of magnitude or more.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{ModSCAN}$: Measuring Stereotypical Bias in Large Vision-Language Models from Vision and Language Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been rapidly developed and widely used in various fields, but the (potential) stereotypical bias in the model is largely unexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering measurement framework, $\texttt{ModSCAN}$, to $\underline{SCAN}$ the stereotypical bias within LVLMs from both vision and language $\underline{Mod}$alities. $\texttt{ModSCAN}$ examines stereotypical biases with respect to two typical stereotypical attributes (gender and race) across three kinds of scenarios: occupations, descriptors, and persona traits. Our findings suggest that 1) the currently popular LVLMs show significant stereotype biases, with CogVLM emerging as the most biased model; 2) these stereotypical biases may stem from the inherent biases in the training dataset and pre-trained models; 3) the utilization of specific prompt prefixes (from both vision and language modalities) performs well in reducing stereotypical biases. We believe our work can serve as the foundation for understanding and addressing stereotypical bias in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Testing Credibility of Public and Private Surveys through the Lens of Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing whether a sample survey is a credible representation of the population is an important question to ensure the validity of any downstream research. While this problem, in general, does not have an efficient solution, one might take a task-based approach and aim to understand whether a certain data analysis tool, like linear regression, would yield similar answers both on the population and the sample survey. In this paper, we design an algorithm to test the credibility of a sample survey in terms of linear regression. In other words, we design an algorithm that can certify if a sample survey is good enough to guarantee the correctness of data analysis done using linear regression tools. Nowadays, one is naturally concerned about data privacy in surveys. Thus, we further test the credibility of surveys published in a differentially private manner. Specifically, we focus on Local Differential Privacy (LDP), which is a standard technique to ensure privacy in surveys where the survey participants might not trust the aggregator. We extend our algorithm to work even when the data analysis has been done using surveys with LDP. In the process, we also propose an algorithm that learns with high probability the guarantees a linear regression model on a survey published with LDP. Our algorithm also serves as a mechanism to learn linear regression models from data corrupted with noise coming from any subexponential distribution. We prove that it achieves the optimal estimation error bound for $\ell_1$ linear regression, which might be of broader interest. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithms while trying to reduce the sample complexity for both public and private surveys. We also numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on real and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Federated Neural Nonparametric Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are effective for modeling event occurrences over time, but they struggle with sparse and uncertain events in federated systems, where privacy is a major concern. To address this, we propose \textit{FedPP}, a Federated neural nonparametric Point Process model. FedPP integrates neural embeddings into Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox Processes (SGCPs) on the client side, which is a flexible and expressive class of TPPs, allowing it to generate highly flexible intensity functions that capture client-specific event dynamics and uncertainties while efficiently summarizing historical records. For global aggregation, FedPP introduces a divergence-based mechanism that communicates the distributions of SGCPs' kernel hyperparameters between the server and clients, while keeping client-specific parameters local to ensure privacy and personalization. FedPP effectively captures event uncertainty and sparsity, and extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in federated settings, particularly with KL divergence and Wasserstein distance-based global aggregation.</description>

      <title>Minimally Intrusive Access Management to Content Delivery Networks based on Performance Models and Access Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to managing access to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), focusing on combating the misuse of tokens through performance analysis and statistical access patterns. In particular, we explore the impact of token sharing on the content delivery infrastructure, proposing the definition of acceptable request limits to detect and block abnormal accesses. Additionally, we introduce countermeasures against piracy, such as degrading the quality of service for pirate users to discourage them from illegal sharing, and using queuing models to quantify system performance in different piracy scenarios. Adopting these measures can improve the consistency and efficiency of CDN access and cost management, protecting the infrastructure and the legitimate user experience.</description>

      <title>Private and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning based on Differentially Private Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05733v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces two primary challenges: the risk of privacy leakage due to parameter sharing and communication inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose DPSFL, a federated learning method that utilizes differentially private sketches. DPSFL compresses the local gradients of each client using a count sketch, thereby improving communication efficiency, while adding noise to the sketches to ensure differential privacy (DP). We provide a theoretical analysis of privacy and convergence for the proposed method. Gradient clipping is essential in DP learning to limit sensitivity and constrain the addition of noise. However, clipping introduces bias into the gradients, negatively impacting FL performance. To mitigate the impact of clipping, we propose an enhanced method, DPSFL-AC, which employs an adaptive clipping strategy. Experimental comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate the superiority of our methods concerning privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improved Sample Complexity for Private Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differentially private (DP) optimization algorithms for stochastic and empirical objectives which are neither smooth nor convex, and propose methods that return a Goldstein-stationary point with sample complexity bounds that improve on existing works. We start by providing a single-pass $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm that returns an $(\alpha,\beta)$-stationary point as long as the dataset is of size $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(1/\alpha\beta^{3}+d/\epsilon\alpha\beta^{2}+d^{3/4}/\epsilon^{1/2}\alpha\beta^{5/2}\right)$, which is $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ times smaller than the algorithm of Zhang et al. [2024] for this task, where $d$ is the dimension. We then provide a multi-pass polynomial time algorithm which further improves the sample complexity to $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(d/\beta^2+d^{3/4}/\epsilon\alpha^{1/2}\beta^{3/2}\right)$, by designing a sample efficient ERM algorithm, and proving that Goldstein-stationary points generalize from the empirical loss to the population loss.</description>

      <title>The Cyber Alliance Game: How Alliances Influence Cyber-Warfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-warfare has become the norm in current ongoing military conflicts. Over the past decade, numerous examples have shown the extent to which nation-states become vulnerable if they do not focus on building their cyber capacities. Adding to the inherent complexity of cyberwar scenarios, a state is usually a member of one or more alliances. Alliance policies and internal struggles could shape the individual actions of member states; intuitively, this also holds for the cyber domain.
  In this paper, we define and study a simple Cyber Alliance Game with the objective of understanding the fundamental influence of alliances on cyber conflicts between nation-states. Specifically, we focus on the decision of whether to exploit a newly found vulnerability individually or share it with the alliance. First, we characterize the impact of vulnerability-sharing rewards on the resulting equilibrium. Second, we study the implications of the internal power structure of alliances on cyberwar outcomes and infer the expected behavior of Dictator, Veto, and Dummy players. Finally, we investigate how alliances can nudge their members via rewards and punishments to adhere to their defensive or offensive cyber policy. We believe that our results contribute to the fundamental understanding of real-world cyber-conflicts by characterizing the impact of alliances.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Functional Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, a user that holds a ciphertext and a function-key can learn the result of applying the function to the plaintext message. Security requires that the user does not learn anything beyond the function evaluation. On the other hand, unclonable encryption (UE) is a uniquely quantum primitive, which ensures that an adversary cannot duplicate a ciphertext to decrypt the same message multiple times. In this work we introduce unclonable quantum functional encryption (UFE), which both extends the notion of FE to the quantum setting and also possesses the unclonable security of UE. We give a construction for UFE that supports arbitrary quantum messages and polynomialy-sized circuit, and achieves unclonable-indistinguishable security for independently sampled function keys. In particular, our UFE guarantees that two parties cannot simultaneously recover the correct function outputs using two independently sampled function keys. Our construction combines quantum garbled circuits [BY22], and quantum-key unclonable encryption [AKY24], and leverages techniques from the plaintext expansion arguments in [Hir+23]. As an application we give the first construction for public-key UE with variable decryption keys. Lastly, we establish a connection between quantum indistinguishability obfuscation (qiO) and quantum functional encryption (QFE); Showing that any multi-input indistinguishability-secure quantum functional encryption scheme unconditionally implies the existence of qiO.</description>

      <title>Filtered Randomized Smoothing: A New Defense for Robust Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classifiers have recently been used for the modulation classification of RF signals. These classifiers have shown impressive performance gains relative to conventional methods, however, they are vulnerable to imperceptible (low-power) adversarial attacks. Some of the prominent defense approaches include adversarial training (AT) and randomized smoothing (RS). While AT increases robustness in general, it fails to provide resilience against previously unseen adaptive attacks. Other approaches, such as Randomized Smoothing (RS), which injects noise into the input, address this shortcoming by providing provable certified guarantees against arbitrary attacks, however, they tend to sacrifice accuracy.
  In this paper, we study the problem of designing robust DNN-based modulation classifiers that can provide provable defense against arbitrary attacks without significantly sacrificing accuracy. To this end, we first analyze the spectral content of commonly studied attacks on modulation classifiers for the benchmark RadioML dataset. We observe that spectral signatures of un-perturbed RF signals are highly localized, whereas attack signals tend to be spread out in frequency. To exploit this spectral heterogeneity, we propose Filtered Randomized Smoothing (FRS), a novel defense which combines spectral filtering together with randomized smoothing. FRS can be viewed as a strengthening of RS by leveraging the specificity (spectral Heterogeneity) inherent to the modulation classification problem. In addition to providing an approach to compute the certified accuracy of FRS, we also provide a comprehensive set of simulations on the RadioML dataset to show the effectiveness of FRS and show that it significantly outperforms existing defenses including AT and RS in terms of accuracy on both attacked and benign signals.</description>

      <title>Can DeepFake Speech be Reliably Detected?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly those with voice cloning capabilities, have made voice impersonation readily accessible, raising ethical and legal concerns due to potential misuse for malicious activities like misinformation campaigns and fraud. While synthetic speech detectors (SSDs) exist to combat this, they are vulnerable to ``test domain shift", exhibiting decreased performance when audio is altered through transcoding, playback, or background noise. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by deliberate manipulation of synthetic speech aimed at deceiving detectors. This work presents the first systematic study of such active malicious attacks against state-of-the-art open-source SSDs. White-box attacks, black-box attacks, and their transferability are studied from both attack effectiveness and stealthiness, using both hardcoded metrics and human ratings. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust detection methods in the face of evolving adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>Root Defence Strategies: Ensuring Safety of LLM at the Decoding Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its helpfulness compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Cheating Automatic LLM Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Cheating-LLM-Benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity Threat Hunting and Vulnerability Analysis Using a Neo4j Graph Database of Open Source Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open source intelligence is a powerful tool for cybersecurity analysts to gather information both for analysis of discovered vulnerabilities and for detecting novel cybersecurity threats and exploits. However the scale of information that is relevant for information security on the internet is always increasing, and is intractable for analysts to parse comprehensively. Therefore methods of condensing the available open source intelligence, and automatically developing connections between disparate sources of information, is incredibly valuable. In this research, we present a system which constructs a Neo4j graph database formed by shared connections between open source intelligence text including blogs, cybersecurity bulletins, news sites, antivirus scans, social media posts (e.g., Reddit and Twitter), and threat reports. These connections are comprised of possible indicators of compromise (e.g., IP addresses, domains, hashes, email addresses, phone numbers), information on known exploits and techniques (e.g., CVEs and MITRE ATT&amp;CK Technique ID's), and potential sources of information on cybersecurity exploits such as twitter usernames. The construction of the database of potential IoCs is detailed, including the addition of machine learning and metadata which can be used for filtering of the data for a specific domain (for example a specific natural language) when needed. Examples of utilizing the graph database for querying connections between known malicious IoCs and open source intelligence documents, including threat reports, are shown. We show three specific examples of interesting connections found in the graph database; the connections to a known exploited CVE, a known malicious IP address, and a malware hash signature.</description>

      <title>Secure Composition of Robust and Optimising Compilers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure that secure applications do not leak their secrets, they are required to uphold several security properties such as spatial and temporal memory safety as well as cryptographic constant time. Existing work shows how to enforce these properties individually, in an architecture-independent way, by using secure compiler passes that each focus on an individual property. Unfortunately, given two secure compiler passes that each preserve a possibly different security property, it is unclear what kind of security property is preserved by the composition of those secure compiler passes. This paper is the first to study what security properties are preserved across the composition of different secure compiler passes. Starting from a general theory of property composition for security-relevant properties (such as the aforementioned ones), this paper formalises a theory of composition of secure compilers. Then, it showcases this theory a secure multi-pass compiler that preserves the aforementioned security-relevant properties. Crucially, this paper derives the security of the multi-pass compiler from the composition of the security properties preserved by its individual passes, which include security-preserving as well as optimisation passes. From an engineering perspective, this is the desirable approach to building secure compilers.</description>

      <title>Practical, Private Assurance of the Value of Collaboration via Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two parties wish to collaborate on their datasets. However, before they reveal their datasets to each other, the parties want to have the guarantee that the collaboration would be fruitful. We look at this problem from the point of view of machine learning, where one party is promised an improvement on its prediction model by incorporating data from the other party. The parties would only wish to collaborate further if the updated model shows an improvement in accuracy. Before this is ascertained, the two parties would not want to disclose their models and datasets. In this work, we construct an interactive protocol for this problem based on the fully homomorphic encryption scheme over the Torus (TFHE) and label differential privacy, where the underlying machine learning model is a neural network. Label differential privacy is used to ensure that computations are not done entirely in the encrypted domain, which is a significant bottleneck for neural network training according to the current state-of-the-art FHE implementations. We formally prove the security of our scheme assuming honest-but-curious parties, but where one party may not have any expertise in labelling its initial dataset. Experiments show that we can obtain the output, i.e., the accuracy of the updated model, with time many orders of magnitude faster than a protocol using entirely FHE operations.</description>

      <title>Kick Bad Guys Out! Conditionally Activated Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04055v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where malicious clients submit poisoned models to disrupt the convergence or plant backdoors that cause the global model to misclassify some samples. Current defense methods are often impractical for real-world FL systems, as they either rely on unrealistic prior knowledge or cause accuracy loss even in the absence of attacks. Furthermore, these methods lack a protocol for verifying execution, leaving participants uncertain about the correct execution of the mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection strategy that is designed for real-world FL systems. Our approach activates the defense only when potential attacks are detected, and enables the removal of malicious models without affecting the benign ones. Additionally, we incorporate zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the integrity of the proposed defense mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing FL system security against a comprehensive set of adversarial attacks in various ML tasks.</description>

      <title>Complexity Assessment of Analog and Digital Security Primitives Signals Using the Disentropy of Autocorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of regularity in signals can be of great importance, typically in medicine to analyse electrocardiogram (ECG) or electromyography (EMG) signals, but also in climate studies, finance or security. In this work we focus on security primitives such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) or Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs). Such primitives must have a high level of complexity or entropy in their responses to guarantee enough security for their applications. There are several ways of assessing the complexity of their responses, especially in the binary domain. With the development of analog PUFs such as optical (photonic) PUFs, it would be useful to be able to assess their complexity in the analog domain when designing them, for example, before converting analog signals into binary. In this numerical study, we decided to explore the potential of the disentropy of autocorrelation as a measure of complexity for security primitives as PUFs, TRNGs or PRNGs with analog output or responses. We compare this metric to others used to assess regularities in analog signals such as Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Fuzzy Entropy (FuzEn). We show that the disentropy of autocorrelation is able to differentiate between well-known PRNGs and non-optimised or bad PRNGs in the analog and binary domain with a better contrast than ApEn and FuzEn. Next, we show that the disentropy of autocorrelation is able to detect small patterns injected in PUFs responses and then we applied it to photonic PUFs simulations.</description>

      <title>Metric Differential Privacy at the User-Level Via the Earth Mover's Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric differential privacy (DP) provides heterogeneous privacy guarantees based on a distance between the pair of inputs. It is a widely popular notion of privacy since it captures the natural privacy semantics for many applications (such as, for location data) and results in better utility than standard DP. However, prior work in metric DP has primarily focused on the item-level setting where every user only reports a single data item. A more realistic setting is that of user-level DP where each user contributes multiple items and privacy is then desired at the granularity of the user's entire contribution. In this paper, we initiate the study of one natural definition of metric DP at the user-level. Specifically, we use the earth-mover's distance ($d_\textsf{EM}$) as our metric to obtain a notion of privacy as it captures both the magnitude and spatial aspects of changes in a user's data.
  We make three main technical contributions. First, we design two novel mechanisms under $d_\textsf{EM}$-DP to answer linear queries and item-wise queries. Specifically, our analysis for the latter involves a generalization of the privacy amplification by shuffling result which may be of independent interest. Second, we provide a black-box reduction from the general unbounded to bounded $d_\textsf{EM}$-DP (size of the dataset is fixed and public) with a novel sampling based mechanism. Third, we show that our proposed mechanisms can provably provide improved utility over user-level DP, for certain types of linear queries and frequency estimation.</description>

      <title>LightDE: A Lightweight Method for Eliminating Dangling Pointers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread presence of Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities poses a serious threat to software security, with dangling pointers being considered the primary cause of these vulnerabilities. However, existing methods for defending against UAF vulnerabilities by eliminating dangling pointers need to interrupt the program's execution when encountering pointer assignment operations in order to store the memory addresses of the pointers in a specific data structure. This makes these methods not lightweight. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel approach called LightDE. This method does not require storing the memory addresses of pointers during program execution. LightDE uses our proposed structure-sensitive pointer analysis method to determine which objects pointers point to and stores the pointing relationships in the program's data segment during program compilation. Since LightDE only needs to verify if pointers identified by the pointer analysis point to released objects when eliminating dangling pointers, it is very lightweight. Our experimental results show that LightDE can effectively defend against UAF vulnerabilities and the performance overhead it introduces is very low.</description>

      <title>An Efficient TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol with VC Certificate Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a step forward in the design and implementation of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake protocol that enables the use of Verifiable Credential (VC) while maintaining full compliance with RFC-8446 and preserving all the security features of TLS 1.3. The improvement over our previous work lies in the handshake design, which now only uses messages already defined for TLS 1.3. The design has an incredibly positive impact on the implementation, as we made minimal changes to the OpenSSL library and relied mostly on a novel external provider to handle VC and Decentralized IDentifier (DID) related operations. The experimental results prove the feasibility of the design and show comparable performance to the original solution based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 certificates. These results pave the way for the adoption of Self-Sovereign Identity in large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems, with a clear benefit in terms of reducing the cost of identity management.</description>

      <title>A new approach to delegate signing rights to proxy signers using isogeny-based cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-governance is a two-way protocol through which one can use government services, share data and request information. It refers to the use of communication and information technologies to provide government services to public in an efficient and fast manner. In addition, any document submitted to the e-Government system must be authenticated by a government officer using a digital signature scheme. In the context of digital signatures, the proxy signature is an important cryptographic primitive that allows the original signer to delegate signing authority to another signer (proxy signer). The proxy signature has a number of important applications in the e-government system. There are now a large amount of proxy signature schemes. The security of most of them relies on the following hard problems: the discrete logarithm problem and the factorization of integers problem. However, a large-scale quantum computer can solve them in polynomial time due to Shor's algorithm. As a consequence, there is a need for a quantum computer-resistant proxy signature to secure e-governance system from quantum adversaries. In this work, we propose the first post-quantum isogeny based proxy signature scheme CSI-PS (commutative supersingular isogeny proxy signature). Our construction is proven to be uf-cma secure under the hardness of the group action inverse problem (GAIP) based on isogeny.</description>

Abstract: Creating an adversary resilient construction of the Learned Bloom Filter with provable guarantees is an open problem. We define a strong adversarial model for the Learned Bloom Filter. Our adversarial model extends an existing adversarial model designed for the Classical (i.e not ``Learned'') Bloom Filter by prior work and considers computationally bounded adversaries that run in probabilistic polynomial time (PPT). Using our model, we construct an adversary resilient variant of the Learned Bloom Filter called the Downtown Bodega Filter. We show that: if pseudo-random permutations exist, then an Adversary Resilient Learned Bloom Filter may be constructed with $2\lambda$ extra bits of memory and at most one extra pseudo-random permutation in the critical path. We construct a hybrid adversarial model for the case where a fraction of the query workload is chosen by an adversary. We show realistic scenarios where using the Downtown Bodega Filter gives better performance guarantees compared to alternative approaches in this hybrid model.</description>

      <title>Effective and Evasive Fuzz Testing-Driven Jailbreaking Attacks against LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates, our method starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks.
  We evaluated our method on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, our method achieves attack success rates of over 90%,80% and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60%. Additionally, our method can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, our method can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, our method demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses. We will open-source our codes upon publication.</description>

      <title>Research Directions for Verifiable Crypto-Physically Secure TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A niche corner of the Web3 world is increasingly making use of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to build decentralized infrastructure. One of the motivations to use TEEs is to go beyond the current performance limitations of cryptography-based alternatives such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and multi-party computation (MPC). Despite their appealing advantages, current TEEs suffer from serious limitations as they are not secure against physical attacks, and their attestation mechanism is rooted in the chip manufacturer's trust. As a result, Web3 applications have to rely on cloud infrastruture to act as trusted guardians of hardware-based TEEs and have to accept to trust chip manufacturers. This work aims at exploring how we could potentially architect and implement chips that would be secure against physical attacks and would not require putting trust in chip manufacturers. One goal of this work is to motivate the Web3 movement to acknowledge and leverage the substantial amount of relevant hardware research that already exists. In brief, a combination of: (1) physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to secure the root-of-trust; (2) masking and redundancy techniques to secure computations; (3) open source hardware and imaging techniques to verify that a chip matches its expected design; can help move towards attesting that a given TEE can be trusted without the need to trust a cloud provider and a chip manufacturer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new efficient updatable encryption (UE) scheme based on FrodoPKE learning with errors key encapsulation. We analyse the security of the proposed scheme in the backward-leak uni-directional setting within the rand-ind-eu-cpa model. Since the underlying computationally hard problem here is LWE, the scheme is secure against both classical and quantum attacks.</description>

      <title>A Bias-Accuracy-Privacy Trilemma for Statistical Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous notion of data privacy, used for private statistics. The canonical algorithm for differentially private mean estimation is to first clip the samples to a bounded range and then add noise to their empirical mean. Clipping controls the sensitivity and, hence, the variance of the noise that we add for privacy. But clipping also introduces statistical bias. This tradeoff is inherent: we prove that no algorithm can simultaneously have low bias, low error, and low privacy loss for arbitrary distributions.
  Additionally, we show that under strong notions of DP (i.e., pure or concentrated DP), unbiased mean estimation is impossible, even if we assume that the data is sampled from a Gaussian. On the positive side, we show that unbiased mean estimation is possible under a more permissive notion of differential privacy (approximate DP) if we assume that the distribution is symmetric.</description>

      <title>Transferability Bound Theory: Exploring Relationship between Adversarial Transferability and Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prevailing belief in attack and defense community is that the higher flatness of adversarial examples enables their better cross-model transferability, leading to a growing interest in employing sharpness-aware minimization and its variants. However, the theoretical relationship between the transferability of adversarial examples and their flatness has not been well established, making the belief questionable. To bridge this gap, we embark on a theoretical investigation and, for the first time, derive a theoretical bound for the transferability of adversarial examples with few practical assumptions. Our analysis challenges this belief by demonstrating that the increased flatness of adversarial examples does not necessarily guarantee improved transferability. Moreover, building upon the theoretical analysis, we propose TPA, a Theoretically Provable Attack that optimizes a surrogate of the derived bound to craft adversarial examples. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmark datasets and various real-world applications show that TPA can craft more transferable adversarial examples compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We hope that these results can recalibrate preconceived impressions within the community and facilitate the development of stronger adversarial attack and defense mechanisms.

      <title>PrivImage: Differentially Private Synthetic Image Generation using Diffusion Models with Semantic-Aware Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) image data synthesis, which leverages the DP technique to generate synthetic data to replace the sensitive data, allowing organizations to share and utilize synthetic images without privacy concerns. Previous methods incorporate the advanced techniques of generative models and pre-training on a public dataset to produce exceptional DP image data, but suffer from problems of unstable training and massive computational resource demands. This paper proposes a novel DP image synthesis method, termed PRIVIMAGE, which meticulously selects pre-training data, promoting the efficient creation of DP datasets with high fidelity and utility. PRIVIMAGE first establishes a semantic query function using a public dataset. Then, this function assists in querying the semantic distribution of the sensitive dataset, facilitating the selection of data from the public dataset with analogous semantics for pre-training. Finally, we pre-train an image generative model using the selected data and then fine-tune this model on the sensitive dataset using Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). PRIVIMAGE allows us to train a lightly parameterized generative model, reducing the noise in the gradient during DP-SGD training and enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIVIMAGE uses only 1% of the public dataset for pre-training and 7.6% of the parameters in the generative model compared to the state-of-the-art method, whereas achieves superior synthetic performance and conserves more computational resources. On average, PRIVIMAGE achieves 30.1% lower FID and 12.6% higher Classification Accuracy than the state-of-the-art method. The replication package and datasets can be accessed online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address private deep offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the goal is to train a policy on standard control tasks that is differentially private (DP) with respect to individual trajectories in the dataset. To achieve this, we introduce PriMORL, a model-based RL algorithm with formal differential privacy guarantees. PriMORL first learns an ensemble of trajectory-level DP models of the environment from offline data. It then optimizes a policy on the penalized private model, without any further interaction with the system or access to the dataset. In addition to offering strong theoretical foundations, we demonstrate empirically that PriMORL enables the training of private RL agents on offline continuous control tasks with deep function approximations, whereas current methods are limited to simpler tabular and linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We furthermore outline the trade-offs involved in achieving privacy in this setting.</description>

      <title>Position: Towards Resilience Against Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current research on defending against adversarial examples focuses primarily on achieving robustness against a single attack type such as $\ell_2$ or $\ell_{\infty}$-bounded attacks. However, the space of possible perturbations is much larger than considered by many existing defenses and is difficult to mathematically model, so the attacker can easily bypass the defense by using a type of attack that is not covered by the defense. In this position paper, we argue that in addition to robustness, we should also aim to develop defense algorithms that are adversarially resilient -- defense algorithms should specify a means to quickly adapt the defended model to be robust against new attacks. We provide a definition of adversarial resilience and outline considerations of designing an adversarially resilient defense. We then introduce a subproblem of adversarial resilience which we call continual adaptive robustness, in which the defender gains knowledge of the formulation of possible perturbation spaces over time and can then update their model based on this information. Additionally, we demonstrate the connection between continual adaptive robustness and previously studied problems of multiattack robustness and unforeseen attack robustness and outline open directions within these fields which can contribute to improving continual adaptive robustness and adversarial resilience.</description>

      <title>Defensive Unlearning with Adversarial Training for Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, but they also pose safety risks, such as the potential generation of harmful content and copyright violations. The techniques of machine unlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these risks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images containing concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to enhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of adversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust unlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this effectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a straightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs' image generation quality post-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization on an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure robustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text encoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet, ensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a plug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn across various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity, objects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also achieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore robust DM unlearning through AT, setting it apart from existing methods that overlook robustness in concept erasing.

      <title>One Perturbation is Enough: On Generating Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Vision-Language Pre-training Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have exhibited unprecedented capability in many applications by taking full advantage of the multimodal alignment. However, previous studies have shown they are vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial samples. Despite recent success, these methods are generally instance-specific and require generating perturbations for each input sample. In this paper, we reveal that VLP models are also vulnerable to the instance-agnostic universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). Specifically, we design a novel Contrastive-training Perturbation Generator with Cross-modal conditions (C-PGC) to achieve the attack. In light that the pivotal multimodal alignment is achieved through the advanced contrastive learning technique, we devise to turn this powerful weapon against themselves, i.e., employ a malicious version of contrastive learning to train the C-PGC based on our carefully crafted positive and negative image-text pairs for essentially destroying the alignment relationship learned by VLP models. Besides, C-PGC fully utilizes the characteristics of Vision-and-Language (V+L) scenarios by incorporating both unimodal and cross-modal information as effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that C-PGC successfully forces adversarial samples to move away from their original area in the VLP model's feature space, thus essentially enhancing attacks across various victim models and V+L tasks.

      <title>Private prediction for large-scale synthetic text generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach for generating differentially private synthetic text using large language models (LLMs), via private prediction. In the private prediction framework, we only require the output synthetic data to satisfy differential privacy guarantees. This is in contrast to approaches that train a generative model on potentially sensitive user-supplied source data and seek to ensure the model itself is safe to release.
  We prompt a pretrained LLM with source data, but ensure that next-token predictions are made with differential privacy guarantees. Previous work in this paradigm reported generating a small number of examples (&lt;10) at reasonable privacy levels, an amount of data that is useful only for downstream in-context learning or prompting. In contrast, we make changes that allow us to generate thousands of high-quality synthetic data points, greatly expanding the set of potential applications. Our improvements come from an improved privacy analysis and a better private selection mechanism, which makes use of the equivalence between the softmax layer for sampling tokens in LLMs and the exponential mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a novel use of public predictions via the sparse vector technique, in which we do not pay privacy costs for tokens that are predictable without sensitive data; we find this to be particularly effective for structured data.</description>

      <title>Training quantum machine learning models on cloud without uploading the data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the linearity of quantum unitary operations, we propose a method that runs the parameterized quantum circuits before encoding the input data. This enables a dataset owner to train machine learning models on quantum cloud computation platforms, without the risk of leaking the information about the data. It is also capable of encoding a vast amount of data effectively at a later time using classical computations, thus saving runtime on quantum computation devices. The trained quantum machine learning models can be run completely on classical computers, meaning the dataset owner does not need to have any quantum hardware, nor even quantum simulators. Moreover, our method mitigates the encoding bottleneck by reducing the required circuit depth from $O(2^{n})$ to $O(n)$, and relax the tolerance on the precision of the quantum gates for the encoding. These results demonstrate yet another advantage of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning models over existing classical neural networks, and broaden the approaches to data security.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel family of adversarial attacks that exploit the inability of language models to interpret ASCII art. To evaluate these attacks, we propose the ToxASCII benchmark and develop two custom ASCII art fonts: one leveraging special tokens and another using text-filled letter shapes. Our attacks achieve a perfect 1.0 Attack Success Rate across ten models, including OpenAI's o1-preview and LLaMA 3.1.

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Memorization in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization of training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to training data memorization than unconditional DPMs, and the motivated data extraction methods are mostly for conditional DPMs. However, these understandings are primarily empirical, and extracting training data from unconditional models has been found to be extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs under the assumption of model convergence. Our theoretical analysis indicates that extracting data from unconditional models can also be effective by constructing a proper surrogate condition. Based on this result, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on the generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our SIDE can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</description>

      <title>Secure Software/Hardware Hybrid In-Field Testing for System-on-Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) incorporate built-in self-test (BIST) modules deeply integrated into the device's intellectual property (IP) blocks. Such modules handle hardware faults and defects during device operation. As such, BIST results potentially reveal the internal structure and state of the device under test (DUT) and hence open attack vectors. So-called result compaction can overcome this vulnerability by hiding the BIST chain structure but introduces the issues of aliasing and invalid signatures. Software-BIST provides a flexible solution, that can tackle these issues, but suffers from limited observability and fault coverage. In this paper, we hence introduce a low-overhead software/hardware hybrid approach that overcomes the mentioned limitations. It relies on (a) keyed-hash message authentication code (KMAC) available on the SoC providing device-specific secure and valid signatures with zero aliasing and (b) the SoC processor for test scheduling hence increasing DUT availability. The proposed approach offers both on-chip- and remote-testing capabilities. We showcase a RISC-V-based SoC to demonstrate our approach, discussing system overhead and resulting compaction rates.</description>

      <title>MIBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Model Inversion Attack and Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim at leveraging the output information of target models to reconstruct privacy-sensitive training data, raising widespread concerns on privacy threats of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Unfortunately, in tandem with the rapid evolution of MI attacks, the lack of a comprehensive, aligned, and reliable benchmark has emerged as a formidable challenge. This deficiency leads to inadequate comparisons between different attack methods and inconsistent experimental setups. In this paper, we introduce the first practical benchmark for model inversion attacks and defenses to address this critical gap, which is named \textit{MIBench}. This benchmark serves as an extensible and reproducible modular-based toolbox and currently integrates a total of 16 state-of-the-art attack and defense methods. Moreover, we furnish a suite of assessment tools encompassing 9 commonly used evaluation protocols to facilitate standardized and fair evaluation and analysis. Capitalizing on this foundation, we conduct extensive experiments from multiple perspectives to holistically compare and analyze the performance of various methods across different scenarios, which overcomes the misalignment issues and discrepancy prevalent in previous works. Based on the collected attack methods and defense strategies, we analyze the impact of target resolution, defense robustness, model predictive power, model architectures, transferability and loss function. Our hope is that this \textit{MIBench} could provide a unified, practical and extensible toolbox and is widely utilized by researchers in the field to rigorously test and compare their novel methods, ensuring equitable evaluations and thereby propelling further advancements in the future development.</description>
