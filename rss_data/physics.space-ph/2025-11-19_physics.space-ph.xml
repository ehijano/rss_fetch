      <title>Dual Origins of Rapid Flare Ribbon Downflows in an X9-class Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detect rapid downflows of 150-217 km/s in IRIS Si IV 1402.77 nm measurements of an X9-class solar flare on 2024 October 3rd. The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Solar Prominences: Plasma Origin and Mechanisms</title>

Abstract: Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.</description>

      <title>LdT: A new index of ionospheric activity based on GNSS-derived rates of change in TEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06056</link>

Abstract: Many aspects of our societies now depend upon satellite telecommunications, such as those requiring Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). GNSS is based on radio waves that propagate through the ionosphere and experience complicated propagation effects caused by inhomogeneities in its electron density. The Earth's ionosphere forms part of the solar-terrestrial environment, and its state is determined by the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of its electron density. It varies in response to the "space weather" combination of solar activity and geomagnetic conditions. Notably, the radio waves used in satellite telecommunications suffer due to the dispersive nature of the ionospheric plasma.
  Scales and indices that summarise the state of the solar-terrestrial environment due to solar activity and geomagnetic conditions already exist. However, the response of the ionosphere to active geomagnetic conditions, its geoeffectiveness, and its likely impact on systems and services are not encapsulated by these. This is due to the ionosphere's intrinsic day-to-day variability, persistent seasonal patterns, and because radio wave measurements of the ionosphere depend upon many factors.
  Here we develop a novel index that describes the state of the ionosphere during specific space weather conditions. It is based on propagation disturbances in GNSS signals, and is able to characterise the spatio-temporal evolution of ionospheric disturbances in near real time. This new scale encapsulates day-to-day variability, seasonal patterns, and the geo-effective response of the ionosphere to disturbed space weather conditions; and can be applied to data from any GNSS network. It is intended that this new scale will be utilised by agencies providing space weather services, as well as by service operators to appreciate the current conditions in the ionosphere, thus informing their operations.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application, for example, to the cases of the eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$ and our solar system, although they are not limited to such interesting astronomical scenarios alone. The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>
