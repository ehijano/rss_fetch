      <title>Using gauge invariance to symmetrize the energy-momentum tensor of electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that using Noether's Theorem explicitly employing gauge invariance for variations of the electromagnetic four-potential $A^\mu$ straightforwardly ensures that the resulting electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is symmetric. The Belinfante symmetrization procedure is not necessary. The method is based on Bessel-Hagen's 1921 clarification of Noether's original procedure, suggesting that the symmetry problem arises from an incomplete implementation of Noether's Theorem. The derivation addresses in some detail where the usual application of Noether's Theorem falls short, what the Belinfante procedure actually does to fix the problem, and why the usual unsymmetric canonical energy-momentum tensor can only be used for extracting four-momentum conservation based on translational invariance, but will provide meaningless results when applied to rotations or boosts, unless modified appropriately.</description>

      <title>Polyvinylidene fluoride transducer shape optimization for the characterization of anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the ultrasonic determination of mechanical properties, it is common to use oblique incident waves to characterize fluid-immersed anisotropic samples. The lateral displacement of the ultrasonic field owing to leaky guided wave phenomena poses a challenge for data inversion because beam spreading is rarely well represented by plane-wave models. In this study, a finite beam model based on the angular spectrum method was developed to estimate the influence of the transducer shape and position on the transmitted signals. Additionally, anisotropic solids were considered so that the beam skewing effect was contemplated. A small-emitter large-receiver configuration was chosen, and the ideal shape and position of the receiving transducer were obtained through a meta-heuristic optimization approach with the goal of achieving a measurement system that sufficiently resembles plane-wave propagation. A polyvinylidene fluoride receiver was fabricated based on the findings and tested in three cases: a single-crystal silicon wafer, a lightly anisotropic stainless-steel plate, and a highly anisotropic composite plate. Good agreement was found between the measurements and the plane-wave model.</description>
