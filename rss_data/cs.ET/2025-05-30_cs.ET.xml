      <title>CrossNAS: A Cross-Layer Neural Architecture Search Framework for PIM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the CrossNAS framework, an automated approach for exploring a vast, multidimensional search space that spans various design abstraction layers-circuits, architecture, and systems-to optimize the deployment of machine learning workloads on analog processing-in-memory (PIM) systems. CrossNAS leverages the single-path one-shot weight-sharing strategy combined with the evolutionary search for the first time in the context of PIM system mapping and optimization. CrossNAS sets a new benchmark for PIM neural architecture search (NAS), outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and energy efficiency while maintaining comparable or shorter search times.</description>

      <title>Routing-Aware Placement for Zoned Neutral Atom-based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to solve previously intractable problems, with neutral atoms emerging as a promising technology. Zoned neutral atom architectures allow for immense parallelism and higher coherence times by shielding idling atoms from interference with laser beams. However, in addition to hardware, successful quantum computation requires sophisticated software support, particularly compilers that optimize quantum algorithms for hardware execution. In the compilation flow for zoned neutral atom architectures, the effective interplay of the placement and routing stages decides the overhead caused by rearranging the atoms during the quantum computation. Sub-optimal placements can lead to unnecessary serialization of the rearrangements in the subsequent routing stage. Despite this, all existing compilers treat placement and routing independently thus far - focusing solely on minimizing travel distances. This work introduces the first routing-aware placement method to address this shortcoming. It groups compatible movements into parallel rearrangement steps to minimize both rearrangement steps and travel distances. The implementation utilizing the A* algorithm reduces the rearrangement time by 17% on average and by 49% in the best case compared to the state-of-the-art. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap.</description>

      <title>MenTeR: A fully-automated Multi-agenT workflow for end-to-end RF/Analog Circuits Netlist Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate, time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation, MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention. MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human designers.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Challenge CNNS in Medical Image Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a multimodal AI framework designed for precisely classifying medical diagnostic images. Utilizing publicly available datasets, the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy, F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated $CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of ARA Wireless Living Lab for Rural Broadband and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the broadband gap between rural and urban regions requires rural-focused wireless research and innovation. In the meantime, rural regions provide rich, diverse use cases of advanced wireless, and they offer unique real-world settings for piloting applications that advance the frontiers of wireless systems (e.g., teleoperation of ground and aerial vehicles). To fill the broadband gap and to leverage the unique opportunities that rural regions provide for piloting advanced wireless applications, we design and implement the ARA wireless living lab for research and innovation in rural wireless systems and their applications in precision agriculture, community services, and so on. ARA focuses on the unique community, application, and economic context of rural regions, and it features the first-of-its-kind, real-world deployment of long-distance, high-capacity terrestrial wireless x-haul and access platforms as well as low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications platforms across a rural area of diameter over 30 km. With both software-defined radios and programmable COTS systems, and through effective orchestration of these wireless resources with fiber as well as compute resources embedded end-to-end across user equipment (UE), base stations (BS), edge, and cloud, including support for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), ARA offers programmability, performance, robustness, and heterogeneity at the same time, thus enabling rural-focused co-evolution of wireless and applications while helping advance the frontiers of wireless systems in domains such as Open RAN, NextG, and agriculture applications.</description>
