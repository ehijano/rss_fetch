      <title>Hydrodynamic equations for a U(N) invariant superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the appropriate set of hydrodynamic equations in a U(N) invariant superfluid that couple the dynamics of superflow and magnetization. In the special case when both the superfluid and normal velocities are zero, the hydrodynamic equations reduce to a generalized version of Landau-Lifshitz equation for ferromagnetism with U(N) symmetry. When both velocities are non-zero, there appears couplings between the superflow and magnetization dynamics, and the superfluid velocity no longer satisfies the irrotational condition. On the other hand, the magnitude of magnetization is no longer a constant of motion as was the case for the standard Landau-Lifshitz theory. In comparison with the simple superfluid, the first sound and second sounds are modified by a non-zero magnetization through various thermodynamic functions. For U(2) invariant superfluid, we get both (zero-) sound wave and a spin wave at zero temperature. It is found that the dispersion of spin wave is always quadratic, which is consistent with detailed microscopic analysis. In the Appendix, we show that the hydrodynamic equation for a U(N) invariant superfluid can be obtained from the general hydrodynamic equation with arbitrary internal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Observing S-Matrix Pole Flow in Resonance Interplay: Cold Collisions of Ultracold Atoms in a Miniature Laser-based Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of experiments exploring resonances in the collision of ultracold clouds of atoms. Using a laser-based accelerator that capitalizes on the energy resolution provided by the ultracold atomic setting, we unveil resonance phenomena such as Feshbach and shape resonances in their quintessential form by literally photographing the halo of outgoing scattered atoms. We exploit the tunability of magnetic Feshbach resonances to instigate an interplay between scattering resonances. By experimentally recording the scattering in a parameter space spanned by collision energy and magnetic field, we capture the imprint of the $S$-matrix pole flow in the complex energy plane. After revisiting experiments that place a Feshbach resonance in the proximity of a shape resonance and an anti-bound state, respectively, we discuss the possibility of using $S$-matrix pole interplay between two Feshbach resonances to create a bound-state-in-the-continuum.</description>

      <title>Fate of Two-Particle Bound States in the Continuum in non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil the existence of two-particle bound state in the continuum (BIC) in a one-dimensional interacting nonreciprocal lattice with a generalized boundary condition. By applying the Bethe-ansatz method, we can exactly solve the wavefunction and eigenvalue of the bound state in the continuum band, which enable us to precisely determine the phase diagrams of BIC. Our results demonstrate that the non-reciprocal hopping can delocalize the bound state and thus shrink the region of BIC. By analyzing the wavefunction, we identify the existence of two types of BICs with different spatial distributions and analytically derive the corresponding threshold values for the breakdown of BICs. The BIC with similar properties is also found to exist in another system with an impurity potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spatial phase coherence in a dissipative Bose-Hubbard atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the loss of spatial coherence of one-dimensional bosonic gases in optical lattices illuminated by a near-resonant excitation laser. Because the atoms recoil in a random direction after each spontaneous emission, the atomic momentum distribution progressively broadens. Equivalently, the spatial correlation function (the Fourier-conjugate quantity of the momentum distribution) progressively narrows down as more photons are scattered. Here we measure the correlation function of the matter field for fixed distances corresponding to nearest-neighbor (n-n) and next-nearest-neighbor (n-n-n) sites of the optical lattice as a function of time, hereafter called n-n and n-n-n correlators. For strongly interacting lattice gases, we find that the n-n correlator $C_1$ decays as a power-law at long times, $C_1\propto 1/t^{\alpha}$, in stark contrast with the exponential decay expected for independent particles. The power-law decay reflects a non-trivial dissipative many-body dynamics, where interactions change drastically the interplay between fluorescence destroying spatial coherence, and coherent tunnelling between neighboring sites restoring spatial coherence at short distances. The observed decay exponent $\alpha \approx 0.54(6) $ is in good agreement with the prediction $\alpha=1/2$ from a dissipative Bose-Hubbard model accounting for the fluorescence-induced decoherence. Furthermore, we find that the n-n correlator $C_1$ controls the n-n-n correlator $C_2$ through the relation $C_2 \approx C_1^2$, also in accordance with the dissipative Bose-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Fundamental role of nonlocal orders in 1D Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal order parameters capture the presence of correlated fluctuations between specific degrees of freedom, in otherwise disordered quantum matter. Here we provide a further example of their fundamental role, deriving the ground state phase diagram of the filling one extended Bose Hubbard model exclusively in terms of their ordering. By means of a density matrix renormalization group numerical analysis, we show that besides the (even) parity order characteristic of the Mott insulating phase, and the string order non vanishing in the Haldane insulator, the recently proposed odd parity order completes the picture, becoming nonvanishing at the transition from the normal superfluid to the paired superfluid phase. The above three nonlocal parameters capture all the distinct phases, including the density wave phase which local order is seen as the simultaneous presence of correlated fluctuations in different channels. They provide a unique tool for the experimental observation of the full phase diagram of strongly correlated quantum matter, by means of local density measurements.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of Efimov physics in ultracold atomic gases with realistic three-body multichannel interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a detailed and self-contained description of a recently developed theoretical and numerical method for the simulation of three identical bosonic alkali-metal atoms near a Feshbach resonance, where the Efimov effect is induced. The method is based on a direct construction of the off-shell two-body transition matrix from exact eigenfunctions of the embedded two-body Hamiltonians, obtained using realistic parameterizations of the interaction potentials which accurately reproduce the molecular energy levels. The transition matrix is then inserted into the appropriate three-body integral equations, which may be efficiently solved on a computer. We focus especially on the power of our method in including rigorously the effects of multichannel physics on the three-body problem, which are usually accounted for only by various approximations. We demonstrate the method for ${}^7$Li, where we recently showed that a correct inclusion of this multichannel physics resolves the long-standing disagreement between theory and experiment regarding the Efimovian three-body parameter. We analyze the Efimovian enhancement of the three-body recombination rate on both sides of the Feshbach resonance, revealing strong sensitivity to the spin structure of the model thus indicating the prevalence of three-body spin-exchange physics. Finally, we discuss an extension of our methodology to the calculation of three-body bound-state energies.</description>

      <title>A cavity-microscope for micrometer-scale control of atom-photon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers the possibility to observe and control the motion of few or individual atoms, enabling the realization of various quantum technological tasks such as quantum-enhanced metrology or quantum simulation of strongly-correlated matter. A core limitation of these experiments lies in the mode structure of the cavity field, which is hard-coded in the shape and geometry of the mirrors. As a result, most applications of cavity QED trade spatial resolution for enhanced sensitivity. Here, we propose and demonstrate a cavity-microscope device capable of controlling in space and time the coupling between atoms and light in a single-mode high-finesse cavity, reaching a spatial resolution an order-of-magnitude lower than the cavity mode waist. This is achieved through local Floquet engineering of the atomic level structure, imprinting a corresponding atom-field coupling. We illustrate this capability by engineering micrometer-scale coupling, using cavity-assisted atomic measurements and optimization. Our system forms an optical device with a single optical axis and has the same footprint and complexity as a standard Fabry-Perot cavity or confocal lens pair, and can be used for any atomic species. This technique opens a wide range of perspectives from ultra-fast, cavity-enhanced mid-circuit readout to the quantum simulation of fully connected models of quantum matter such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Enhanced Superradiance of a Ryderg-Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superradiant phase transition of an array of Rydberg atoms in a dissipative microwave cavity. Under the interplay of the cavity field and the long-range Rydberg interaction, the steady state of the system exhibits an interaction-enhanced superradiance, with vanishing critical atom-cavity coupling rates at a discrete set of interaction strengths. We find that, while the phenomenon can be analytically understood in the case of constant all-to-all interaction, the enhanced superradiance persists under the spatially dependent dipolar interaction, but shifted in the critical interaction strengths. The diverging susceptibility at these critical points is captured by emergent quantum Rabi models, each of which comprises a pair of collective atomic states with different numbers of atomic excitations. These collective states become degenerate at the critical interaction strengths, resulting in a superradiant phase for an arbitrarily small atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Inverse Participation Ratio Estimation in multi-qubit and multi-qudit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Participation Ratios (IPRs) and the related Participation Entropies quantify the spread of a quantum state over a selected basis of the Hilbert space, offering insights into the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of the system. In this work, we propose three quantum algorithms to estimate IPRs on multi-qubit and multi-qudit quantum devices. The first algorithm allows for the estimation of IPRs in the computational basis by single-qubit measurements, while the second one enables measurement of IPR in the eigenbasis of a selected Hamiltonian, without the knowledge about the eigenstates of the system. Next, we provide an algorithm for IPR in the computational basis for a multi-qudit system. We discuss resources required by the algorithms and benchmark them by investigating the one-axis twisting protocol, the thermalization in a deformed PXP model, and the ground state of a spin-$1$ AKLT chain in a transverse field.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation and odd-even effect in finite-temperature electron gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed "odd-parity" modes). Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature, thus covering the temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.1T_F$; (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling; (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, not just temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>Reversal of quantised Hall drifts at non-interacting and interacting topological boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport properties of gapless edge modes at boundaries between topologically distinct domains are of fundamental and technological importance. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of topological edge states and their response to interparticle interactions. Here, we experimentally study long-distance quantised Hall drifts in a harmonically confined topological pump of non-interacting and interacting ultracold fermionic atoms. We find that quantised drifts halt and reverse their direction when the atoms reach a critical slope of the confining potential, revealing the presence of a topological boundary. The drift reversal corresponds to a band transfer between a band with Chern number $C = +1$ and a band with $C = -1$ via a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for non-interacting particles. We establish that a non-zero repulsive Hubbard interaction leads to the emergence of an additional edge in the system, relying on a purely interaction-induced mechanism, in which pairs of fermions are split.</description>

Abstract: The existence and dynamics of stable quantized vortices is an important subject of quantum many-body physics. Spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC), a special type of spin-orbit coupling, has been experimentally achieved to create vortices in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). Here, we generalize the concept of SOAMC to a two-component polariton BEC and analyze the emergence and configuration of vortices under a finite-size circular pumping beam. We find that the regular configuration of vortex lattices induced by a finite-size circular pump is significantly distorted by the spatially dependent Raman coupling of SOAMC, even in the presence of a repulsive polariton interaction which can assist the forming of stable vortex configuration. Meanwhile, a pair of vortices induced by SOAMC located at the center of polariton cloud remains stable. When the Raman coupling is sufficiently strong and interaction is weak, the vortices spiraling in from the edge of polariton cloud will disrupt the polariton BEC.</description>

      <title>Interaction driven topological phase transitions of hardcore bosons on a two-leg ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of hardcore bosons possessing nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions on a two-leg ladder. We show that by allowing nearest neighbour dimerized interactions instead of hopping dimerization, the system exhibits topological phases and phase transitions under proper conditions. First, by assuming uniform hopping throughout the ladder, we show that when interaction along the legs are dimerized and the dimerization pattern is different in the legs, a trivial rung-Mott insulator to a topological bond order phase transition occurs as a function of the dimerization strength. However, for a fixed dimerization strength, the system exhibits a topological to trivial phase transition with increase in the rung hopping. A completely different scenario appears when the rung interaction is turned on. We obtain that for a ladder with uniform hopping, the repulsive interaction either turns the topological phase into a trivial rung-Mott insulator or a charge density wave phase. Such topological features are absent when the dimerization pattern in the nearest neighbour interaction is considered to be identical in both the legs of the ladder. We numerically obtain the ground state properties and also show the signatures of topological phase transitions through Thouless charge pumping.</description>

Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a quantum optimal control protocol to engineer current states: quantum states characterized by Rydberg excitations propagating in a given spatially closed tweezer networks. Indeed, current states with different winding numbers can be generated on demand. Besides those ones with single winding number, superposition of quantum current states characterized by more winding numbers can be obtained. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature of the flow experimentally without the need of accessing high order correlators.</description>
