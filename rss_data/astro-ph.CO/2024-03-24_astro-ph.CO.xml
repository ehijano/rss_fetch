      <title>Fast likelihood-free inference in the LSS Stage IV era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming large-scale structure (LSS) Stage IV surveys will provide us with unprecedented data to probe the nature of dark matter and dark energy. However, analysing these data with conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods will be challenging, due to the increase in the number of nuisance parameters and the presence of intractable likelihoods. In light of this, we present the first application of Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE) (a recent approach in simulation-based inference) to LSS photometric probes: weak lensing, galaxy clustering and the cross-correlation power spectra. In order to analyse the hundreds of spectra simultaneously, we find that a pre-compression of data using principal component analysis, as well as parameter-specific data summaries lead to highly accurate results. Using expected Stage IV experimental noise, we are able to recover the posterior distribution for the cosmological parameters with a speedup factor of $\sim 40-60$ compared to classical MCMC methods. To illustrate that the performance of MNRE is not impeded when posteriors are highly non-Gaussian, we test a scenario of two-body decaying dark matter, finding that Stage IV surveys can improve current bounds on the model by up to one order of magnitude. This result supports that MNRE is a powerful framework to constrain the standard cosmological model and its extensions with next-generation LSS surveys.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Collapse of Pressureless Matter in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If an early matter phase of the Universe existed after inflation with the proper power spectrum, enhanced density perturbations can decouple from the Hubble flow, turn around and collapse. In contrast to what happens in a radiation dominated Universe where pressure nullifies deviations from sphericity in these perturbations, in a matter dominated Universe, the lack of pressure although on the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it allows small deviations from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse takes place. The subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical deviations grow, the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich pancake". After that, the more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent relaxation begins where shells of the cloud cross and the matter is redistributed within a factor of a few of the free fall timescale, reaching a spherical virialized state. During the whole process, strong gravitational waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the collapse and the small time interval that the effect takes place. The emission of gravitational waves during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be easily estimated with an analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to capture the behaviour of matter during this stage in order to estimate the precise spectrum of gravitational waves produced in this scenario.</description>

      <title>First investigation of void statistics in numerical relativity simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply and extend standard tools for void statistics to cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global average and the kinetic curvature density parameter in the centre of voids reaches ~60-80%. Within the limits of resolution of the simulations, the results are consistent with the parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested disks in FR I radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of 17 FR I radio galaxies constructed from the 3CR catalog, which is characterized by edge-darkened radio structures, is studied. The optical core luminosities derived from Hubble Space Telescope observation are used to estimate the Eddington ratios which are found to be below $10^{-3.4}$ for this sample. This is supported by the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich optical diagnostic diagrams derived with the spectroscopic observation of Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, suggesting that these sources are of low ionization nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs). It implies that the accretion in these FR I sources can be modeled as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). Given the low accretion rate, the predicted jet power with a fast-spinning black hole (BH) $a=0.95$ in the Blandford-Znajek mechanics is lower than the estimated one for almost all the sources in our sample. Such powerful jets indicate the presence of magnetically arrested disks (MAD) in the inner region of the ADAF, in the sense that the magnetic fields in the inner accretion zone are strong. Moreover, we show that, even in the MAD scenario, the BH spins in the sample are most likely moderate and/or fast with $a\gtrsim0.5$.</description>

      <title>Structure Formation in Various Dynamical Dark Energy Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the impact of the nature of Dark Energy (DE) on structure formation, focusing on the matter power spectrum and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). By analyzing the matter power spectrum at redshifts $z = 0$ and $z = 5$, as well as the ISW effect on the scale of $\ell = 10-100$, the study provides valuable insights into the influence of DE equations of state (EoS) on structure formation. The findings reveal that dynamical DE models exhibit a stronger matter power spectrum compared to constant DE models, with the JBP model demonstrating the highest amplitude and the CPL model the weakest. Additionally, the study delves into the ISW effect, highlighting the time evolution of the ISW source term $\mathcal{F}(a)$ and its derivative $d\mathcal{F}(a)/da$, and demonstrating that models with constant DE EoS exhibit a stronger amplitude of $\mathcal{F}(a)$ overall, while dynamical models such as CPL exhibit the highest amplitude among the dynamical models, whereas JBP has the lowest. The study also explores the ISW auto-correlation power spectrum and the ISW cross-correlation power spectrum, revealing that dynamical DE models dominate over those with constant DE EoS across various surveys. Moreover, it emphasizes the potential of studying the non-linear matter power spectrum and incorporating datasets from the small scales to further elucidate the dynamical nature of dark energy. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of both the matter power spectrum and the ISW signal in discerning the nature of dark energy, paving the way for future research to explore the matter power spectrum at higher redshifts and in the non-linear regime, providing deeper insights into the dynamical nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Can the NANOGrav observations constrain the geometry of the universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides an elegant explanation for the nearly flat universe observed today, which represents one of the pillars of the standard cosmological model. However, recent studies have reported some deviations from a flat geometry, arguing that a closed universe would be instead favored by observations. Given its central role played in the cosmological context, this paper revisits the issue of spatial curvature in light of the stochastic gravitational wave background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration. For this purpose, we investigate the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation and their propagation in the post-inflationary universe. We propose a new parametrization of the gravitational wave power spectrum, taking into account spatial curvature, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index of tensor perturbations. Therefore, we compare the theoretical predictions with NANOGrav data to possibly constrain the geometry of the universe. We find that the choice of the priors has a significant effect on the computed posterior distributions. In particular, using flat uniform priors results in $\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= 0.00 \pm 0.67$ at the 68\% confidence level. On the other hand, imposing a Planck prior, we obtain $\Omega_{\mathcal{K},0}= -0.05 \pm 0.17$ at the 68\% confidence level. This result aligns with the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and no deviations from a flat universe are found.</description>

      <title>Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure I: a running threshold for thin discs and size predictors from the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a series of studies on the connection between galaxy morphology and the structure of host dark-matter (DM) haloes using cosmological simulations. In this work, we introduce a new kinematic decomposition scheme that features physical identification of morphological components, enabling robust separation of thin and thick discs; and measure a wide range of halo properties, including their locations in the cosmic web, internal structures, and assembly histories. Our analysis of the TNG50 simulation reveals that the orbital-circularity threshold for disc differentiation varies across galaxies, with systematic trends in mass and redshift, so the widely used decomposition method with constant circularity cuts is oversimplified and underestimates thin disc at JWST redshifts. The energy threshold between the stellar halo and the inner galaxy is also a function of mass and redshift, minimizing at the sub-Galactic halo mass, where the circularity threshold peaks. Revisiting the issue of galaxy size predictor, we show that disc sizes in TNG50 exhibit correlations with three structural parameters besides virial mass and redshift: 1) a positive correlation with halo spin $\lambda$ across redshifts -- stronger than previously reported for zoom-in simulations but still weaker than the simple $r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir} \propto \lambda$ scaling; 2) an anti-correlation with DM concentration $c$ that is well described by $r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir} \propto c^{-0.7}$ even when $c$ is measured in the DM only run; 3) more actively accreting haloes having slightly larger discs, as well as more significant stellar haloes and lower thin-to-thick ratio. Disc mass fraction is higher in rounder haloes and in cosmic knots and filaments, implying that disc development needs both stable halo conditions and continuous material supply. Our methodology is public and adaptable to other simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Duals from Equations of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holography relates gravitational theories in five dimensions to four-dimensional quantum field theories in flat space. Under this map, the equation of state of the field theory is encoded in the black hole solutions of the gravitational theory. Solving the five-dimensional Einstein's equations to determine the equation of state is an algorithmic, direct problem. Determining the gravitational theory that gives rise to a prescribed equation of state is a much more challenging, inverse problem. We present a novel approach to solve this problem based on physics-informed neural networks. The resulting algorithm is not only data-driven but also informed by the physics of the Einstein's equations. We successfully apply it to theories with crossovers, first- and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Delicate curvature bounces in the no-boundary wave function and in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed. Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent Boosted Dark Matter from Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse neutrinos from past supernovae in the Universe present us with a unique opportunity to test dark matter (DM) interactions. These neutrinos can scatter and boost the DM particles in the Milky Way halo to relativistic energies allowing us to detect them in terrestrial laboratories. Focusing on generic models of DM-neutrino and electron interactions, mediated by a vector or a scalar boson, we implement energy-dependent scattering cross-sections and perform detailed numerical analysis of DM attenuation due to electron scattering in-medium while propagating towards terrestrial experiments. We set new limits on DM-neutrino and electron interactions for DM with masses in the range $\sim (0.1, 10^4)~$MeV, using recent data from XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and PandaX-4T direct detection experiments. We demonstrate that consideration of energy-dependent cross-sections for DM interactions can significantly affect constraints previously derived under the assumption of constant cross-sections, modifying them by multiple orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Model for Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a parametric model for studying self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The model uses an analytical density profile, calibrated using a controlled N-body SIDM simulation that covers the entire gravothermal evolution, including core-forming and -collapsing phases. By normalizing the calibrated density profile, we obtain a universal description for SIDM halos at any evolution phase. The model allows us to infer properties of SIDM halos based on their cold dark matter (CDM) counterparts. As a basic application, we only require two characteristic parameters of an isolated CDM halo at $z=0$. We then extend the model to incorporate effects induced by halo mass changes, such as major mergers or tidal stripping, making it applicable to both isolated halos and subhalos. The parametric model is tested and validated using cosmological zoom-in SIDM simulations available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the products of structure formation through myriad physical processes that affect their growth and evolution throughout cosmic history. As a result, the matter distribution within galaxy clusters, or their shape, is influenced by cosmology and astrophysical processes, in particular the accretion of new material due to gravity. We introduce an analysis method to investigate the 3D triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters from the Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton -- Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation (CHEX-MATE). In this work, the first paper of a CHEX-MATE triaxial analysis series, we focus on utilizing X-ray data from XMM and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect maps from Planck and ACT to obtain a three dimensional triaxial description of the intracluster medium (ICM) gas. We present the forward modeling formalism of our technique, which projects a triaxial ellipsoidal model for the gas density and pressure to compare directly with the observed two dimensional distributions in X-rays and the SZ effect. A Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to estimate the posterior distributions of the model parameters. Using mock X-ray and SZ observations of a smooth model, we demonstrate that the method can reliably recover the true parameter values. In addition, we apply the analysis to reconstruct the gas shape from the observed data of one CHEX-MATE galaxy cluster, Abell 1689, to illustrate the technique. The inferred parameters are in agreement with previous analyses for that cluster, and our results indicate that the geometrical properties, including the axial ratios of the ICM distribution, are constrained to within a few percent. With much better precision than previous studies, we thus further establish that Abell 1689 is significantly elongated along the line of sight, resulting in its exceptional gravitational lensing properties.</description>

      <title>CMB delensing with deep learning</title>

Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for this analysis is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Neural style transfer of weak lensing mass maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new generative model of projected cosmic mass density maps inferred from weak gravitational lensing observations of distant galaxies (weak lensing mass maps). We construct the model based on a neural style transfer so that it can transform Gaussian weak lensing mass maps into deeply non-Gaussian counterparts as predicted in ray-tracing lensing simulations. We develop an unpaired image-to-image translation method with Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle GAN), which learn efficient mapping from an input domain to a target domain. Our model is designed to enjoy important advantages; it is trainable with no need for paired simulation data, flexible to make the input domain visually meaningful, and expandable to rapidly-produce a map with a larger sky coverage than training data without additional learning. Using 10,000 lensing simulations, we find that appropriate labeling of training data based on field variance requires the model to exhibit a desired diversity of various summary statistics for weak lensing mass maps. Compared with a popular log-normal model, our model improves in predicting the statistical natures of three-point correlations and local properties of rare high-density regions. We also demonstrate that our model enables us to produce a continuous map with a sky coverage of $\sim166\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ but similar non-Gaussian features to training data covering $\sim12\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ in a GPU minute. Hence, our model can be beneficial to massive productions of synthetic weak lensing mass maps, which is of great importance in future precise real-world analyses.</description>

      <title>Concerning S$H_0$ES Data: Discrepant $W_{0,VI}$ Absolute Magnitudes for Cepheids in the Keystone Galaxy NGC4258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: S$H_0$ES $VI$-band photometry for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield discrepant absolute magnitudes. Specifically, the 2016 and 2022 published S$H_0$ES Cepheid data for NGC4258 exhibit a substantial offset of $\Delta W_{0,VI}\simeq0^{\rm m}.3$. That adds to a suite of existing concerns associated with the S$H_0$ES analysis, which in sum imply that their relatively non-changing Hubble constant for nearly twenty years warrants scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Universe with Next Generation Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we use simple performance metrics to assess the science capabilities of future ground-based gravitational-wave detector networks -- composed of A+ or Voyager upgrades to the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories and proposed next generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. These metrics refer to coalescences of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and binary black holes (BBHs) and include: (i) network detection efficiency and detection rate of cosmological sources as a function of redshift, (ii) signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy with which intrinsic and extrinsic parameters would be measured, and (iii) enabling multimessenger astronomy with gravitational waves by accurate 3D localization and early warning alerts. We further discuss the science enabled by the small population of rare and extremely loud events. While imminent upgrades will provide impressive advances in all these metrics, next generation observatories will deliver an improvement of an order-of-magnitude or more in most metrics. In fact, a network containing two or three such facilities will detect half of all the BNS and BBH mergers up to a redshift of $z=1$ and $z=20$, respectively, give access to hundreds of BNSs and ten thousand BBHs with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 100, readily localize hundreds to thousands of mergers to within $1\,{\rm deg^2}$ on the sky and better than 10% in luminosity distance, respectively, and consequently, enable mutlimessenger astronomy through follow-up surveys in the electromagnetic spectrum several times a week. Such networks will further shed light on potential cosmological merger populations and detect an abundance of high-fidelity BNS and BBH signals which will allow investigations of the high-density regime of matter at an unprecedented level and enable precision tests of general relativity in the strong-filed regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from phase transitions and cosmic strings in neutrino mass models with multiple majorons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the origin of Majorana masses within the majoron model and how this can lead to the generation of a distinguishable primordial stochastic background of gravitational waves. We first show how in the simplest majoron model only a contribution from cosmic string can be within the reach of planned experiments. We then consider extensions containing multiple complex scalars, demonstrating how in this case a spectrum comprising contributions from both a strong first order phase transition and cosmic strings can naturally emerge. We show that the interplay between multiple scalar fields can amplify the phase transition signal, potentially leading to double peaks over the wideband sloped spectrum from cosmic strings. We also underscore the possibility of observing such a gravitational wave background to provide insights into the reheating temperature of the universe. We conclude highlighting how the model can be naturally combined with scenarios addressing the origin of matter of the universe, where baryogenesis occurs via leptogenesis and a right-handed neutrino plays the role of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictivity of many non-thermal dark matter (DM) models is marred by the gravitational production background. This problem is ameliorated in models with lower reheating temperature $T_R$, which allows for dilution of gravitationally produced relics. We study the freeze-in dark matter production mechanism in the thermal bath with the electroweak scale temperature. The process is Boltzmann-suppressed if the dark matter mass is above $T_R$. In this case, the coupling to the thermal bath has to be significant to account for the observed dark matter relic density. As a result, the direct DM detection experiments already probe such freeze-in models, excluding significant parts of parameter space. The forthcoming experiments will explore this framework further, extending to lower couplings and higher reheating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Limits on dark matter annihilation in prompt cusps from the isotropic gamma-ray background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that thermally produced dark matter will form highly concentrated, low-mass cusps in the early universe that often survive until the present. While these cusps contain a small fraction of the dark matter, their high density significantly increases the expected gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation, particularly in searches of large angular regions. We utilize 14 years of Fermi-LAT data to set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation through a detailed study of the isotropic gamma-ray background, excluding with 95% confidence dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states for dark matter masses below 120 GeV.</description>

      <title>Testing strengths, limitations and biases of current Pulsar Timing Arrays detection analyses on realistic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art searches for gravitational waves (GWs) in pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian and stationary process described by a power-law. In practice, none of these properties are expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which is expected to be the primary signal in the PTA band. We perform a systematic investigation of the performance of current search algorithms, using a simple power law model to characterize GW signals in realistic datasets. We use, as the baseline dataset, synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA (EPTA) second data release (DR2). Thus, we include in the dataset uneven time stamps, achromatic and chromatic red noise and multi-frequency observations. We then inject timing residuals from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs, performing a methodical investigation of the recovered signal. We find that current search models are efficient at recovering the GW signal, but several biases can be identified due to the signal-template mismatch, which we identify via probability-probability (P-P) plots and quantify using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics. We discuss our findings in light of the signal observed in the EPTA DR2 and corroborate its consistency with an SMBHB origin.</description>

      <title>Generation of realistic input parameters for simulating atmospheric point-spread functions at astronomical observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulated astronomical images are an important tool in developing and measuring the performance of image-processing algorithms, particularly for high precision measurements of cosmic shear -- correlated distortions of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing caused by the large-scale mass distribution in the Universe. For unbiased measurements of cosmic shear, all other sources of correlated image distortions must be modeled or removed. One such source is the correlated blurring of images due to optical turbulence in the atmosphere, which dominates the point-spread function (PSF) for ground-based instruments. In this work, we leverage data from weather forecasting models to produce wind speeds and directions, and turbulence parameters, that are realistically correlated with altitude. To study the resulting correlations in the size and shape of the PSF, we generate simulated images of the PSF across a ~10 square-degree field of view -- the size of the camera focal plane for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile -- using weather data and historical seeing for a geographic location near the Observatory. We make quantitative predictions for two-point correlation functions (2PCF) that are used in analyses of cosmic shear. We observe a strong anisotropy in the two-dimensional 2PCF, which is expected based on observations in real images, and study the dependence of the orientation of the anisotropy on dominant wind directions near the ground and at higher altitudes.
  The code repository for producing the correlated weather parameters for input to simulations (psf-weather-station) is public at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/psf-weather-station.</description>
