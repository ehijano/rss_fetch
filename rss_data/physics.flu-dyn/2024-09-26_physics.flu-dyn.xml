      <title>Modeling of thin liquid films with arbitrary many layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the generalization of the thin film equation (TFE) to arbitrarily many immiscible liquid layers. Then, we provide different pathways for deriving the hydrodynamic pressure within the individual layers, showing how to understand the equation as a Cahn-Hilliard-type conservation equation and providing an algorithm to derive the associated Onsager Matrix. Furthermore, we employ a numerical solver based on the multilayer shallow water-lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for two and three liquid layers in pseudo two and three dimensions to gain insights into the dynamics of the system and to validate the model. We perform a linear stability analysis and assess droplet equilibrium shapes. Furthermore, we compare the dynamics of the proposed thin film equation to full Navier-Stokes simulations and show the possible equilibrium states of the multilayer liquid thin film system.</description>

      <title>Biglobal linear stability analysis of a ducted 2D premixed flame: intrinsic thermoacoustic mode and role of exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to establish a detailed description of the physical mechanisms of intrinsic thermoacoustic modes and their interplay with duct acoustic modes. The biglobal linear stability analysis of an anchored laminar flame in an acoustic duct is carried out by exploiting the linearized compressible reactive flow equations. The pure intrinsic thermoacoustic mode is first identified and characterized under conditions where the eigenfrequencies of duct acoustic modes are sufficiently high and no mode interplay is present. Parameter variations, considering the inflow Mach number and acoustic reflection coefficients, are conducted to study the behaviors of eigenmode trajectories in the proximity of an exceptional point. Near the exceptional point, trajectory veering and mode switching are observed, and the extreme sensitivity renders the mode trajectory highly dependent on the choices of parameter and parameter variation path. One important finding is that different parameter variation paths can lead to inconsistent results in mode origin identification. Hence, we propose to characterize the thermoacoustic modes based on the flow structures. Specifically, the Helmholtz decomposition is employed to extract the potential and solenoidal components of the thermoacoustic modes. Intrinsic thermoacoustic modes and duct acoustic modes exhibit distinct flow structures, which are clearly distinguishable through the decomposed fields. Near the exceptional point, thermoacoustic modes display characteristics common to both intrinsic and duct modes. The results from compressible reactive flow analysis reveal that the flow structure of eigenmodes offers new insights into intrinsic thermoacoustic modes and mode interplay near the exceptional point.</description>

      <title>Dispersion and mixing in heterogeneous compressible porous media under transient forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic forcing of flow in compressible porous media is an important driver for solute dispersion and mixing in geological and engineered porous media subject for example to tides, pumping and recharge cycles, or fluid injection and withdrawal cycles with a wide range of environmental and industrial applications. The combination of periodic forcing, spatial medium heterogeneity and medium compressibility leads to intricate spatio-temporal flow, dispersion and mixing patterns. We analyze these patterns using detailed numerical simulations based on a stochastic representation of the spatial medium heterogeneity. Solute dispersion is characterized by the interface length and width, mixing in terms of the dilution index and the distribution of concentration point values. Poincar\'e maps show how the interplay of heterogeneity and compressibility leads to the creation of stable regions that inhibit the advancement and dispersion of the mixing interface, and chaotic regions that at the same time enhance solute mixing. This means that spatial heterogeneity in combination with temporal forcing can lead to the containment of solute and at the same time promote mixing.</description>

      <title>A comparison of h- and p-refinement to capture wind turbine wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a critical aspect of wind energy research - the development of wind turbine wake and its significant impact on wind farm efficiency. The study focuses on the exploration and comparison of two mesh refinement strategies, h- and p-refinement, in their ability to accurately compute the development of wind turbine wake. The h-refinement method refines the mesh by reducing the size of the elements, while the p-refinement method increases the polynomial degree of the elements, potentially reducing the error exponentially for smooth flows. A comprehensive comparison of these methods is presented that evaluates their effectiveness, computational efficiency, and suitability for various scenarios in wind energy. The findings of this research could potentially guide future studies and applications in wind turbine wake modeling, thus contributing to the optimization of wind farms using high-order h/p methods. This study fills a gap in the literature by thoroughly investigating the application of these methods in the context of wind turbine wake development.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a fluid flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions. The fluid imposes elastic, viscous, and active stresses on such surfaces, which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stress in a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two-dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring the active stresses in active anisotropic biological systems. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Early theories on fluid resistance and translation of Euler's "Dilucidationes de resistentia fluidorum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1763, Euler published "Dilucidationes de resistentia fluidorum" (Explanations on the resistance of fluids), a memoir that challenges the fluid resistance theories proposed by Isaac Newton and d'Alembert. Euler's work explores the resistance experienced by solid bodies moving through fluids, critiquing both Newton's "common rule" and d'Alembert's paradox, which predicted zero resistance for non-viscous fluids. Euler's treatise is divided into two parts: the first focuses on the mathematical modeling of fluid flow patterns, while the second addresses the calculation of fluid resistance on surfaces. Despite significant advancements, Euler's work remains constrained by the limitations of non-viscous fluid assumptions, ultimately grappling with the same paradoxes he sought to overcome. This paper reviews the key contributions and limitations of "Dilucidationes", emphasizing the ongoing relevance of Euler's insights in the context of classical fluid dynamics. Additionally, it highlights the translation capabilities of AI-powered tools, specifically ChatGPT, in translating complex mathematical texts, marking a noticeable improvement in handling notation-heavy content.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Surrogate Models for Airfoil Flow Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging neural networks as surrogate models for turbulence simulation is a topic of growing interest. At the same time, embodying the inherent uncertainty of simulations in the predictions of surrogate models remains very challenging. The present study makes a first attempt to use denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to train an uncertainty-aware surrogate model for turbulence simulations. Due to its prevalence, the simulation of flows around airfoils with various shapes, Reynolds numbers, and angles of attack is chosen as the learning objective. Our results show that DDPMs can successfully capture the whole distribution of solutions and, as a consequence, accurately estimate the uncertainty of the simulations. The performance of DDPMs is also compared with varying baselines in the form of Bayesian neural networks and heteroscedastic models. Experiments demonstrate that DDPMs outperform the other methods regarding a variety of accuracy metrics. Besides, it offers the advantage of providing access to the complete distributions of uncertainties rather than providing a set of parameters. As such, it can yield realistic and detailed samples from the distribution of solutions. We also evaluate an emerging generative modeling variant, flow matching, in comparison to regular diffusion models. The results demonstrate that flow matching addresses the problem of slow sampling speed typically associated with diffusion models. As such, it offers a promising new paradigm for uncertainty quantification with generative models.</description>

      <title>Scattering of surface waves by ocean currents: the U2H map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean turbulence at meso- and submesocales affects the propagation of surface waves through refraction and scattering, inducing spatial modulations in significant wave height (SWH). We develop a theoretical framework that relates these modulations to the current that induces them. We exploit the asymptotic smallness of the ratio of typical current speed to wave group speed to derive a linear map -- the U2H map -- between surface current velocity and SWH anomaly. The U2H map is a convolution, non-local in space, expressible as a product in Fourier space by a factor independent of the magnitude of the wavenumber vector. Analytic expressions of the U2H map show how the SWH responds differently to the vortical and divergent parts of the current, and how the anisotropy of the wave spectrum is key to large current-induced SWH anomalies. We implement the U2H map numerically and test its predictions against WAVEWATCH III numerical simulations for both idealised and realistic current configurations.</description>

      <title>Role of melting and solidification in the spreading of an impacting water drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study reports experiments of water droplet impacting on ice or on a cold metallic substrate, with the aim of understanding the effect of phase change on the impingement process. Both liquid and substrate temperatures are varied, as well as the height of fall. The dimensionless maximum spreading diameter, $\beta_m$, is found to increase with both temperatures as well as with the impact velocity. Furthermore, $\beta_m$ is reduced when solidification, which enhances dissipation, is present, whereas fusion favours the liquid film spreading. These observations are rationalized by extending an existing model of effective viscosity, in which phase change alters the size and shape of the developing viscous boundary layer, thereby modifying the value of $\beta_m$. The use of this correction allows to adapt a scaling law existing for isothermal drop impacts to propose a universal law giving the maximum diameter of an impacting water droplet in the presence of melting or solidification.</description>

      <title>Fourier neural operators for spatiotemporal dynamics in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows for most real-world applications remains an outstanding computational challenge. Several machine learning approaches have recently been proposed to alleviate the computational cost even though they become unstable or unphysical for long time predictions. We identify that the Fourier neural operator (FNO) based models combined with a partial differential equation (PDE) solver can accelerate fluid dynamic simulations and thus address computational expense of large-scale turbulence simulations. We treat the FNO model on the same footing as a PDE solver and answer important questions about the volume and temporal resolution of data required to build pre-trained models for turbulence. We also discuss the pitfalls of purely data-driven approaches that need to be avoided by the machine learning models to become viable and competitive tools for long time simulations of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Osmosis drives explosions and methane release in Siberian permafrost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mysterious craters, with anomalously high concentrations of methane, have formed in the Yamal and Taymyr peninsulas of Siberia since 2014. While thawing permafrost owing to climate warming promotes methane releases, it is unknown how such release might be associated with explosion and crater formation. A significant volume of surface ice-melt water can migrate downward driven by osmotic pressure associated with a cryopeg, a lens of salty water below. Overpressure reached at depth may lead to the cracking of the soil and subsequent decomposition of methane hydrates, with implications for the climate.</description>
