      <title>Benefits and Limitations of Communication in Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly, (ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory. Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable multi-agent reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Static Sandboxes Are Inadequate: Modeling Societal Complexity Requires Open-Ended Co-Evolution in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.}</description>

      <title>Stop Reducing Responsibility in LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Systems to Local Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) unlock new potentials in distributed reasoning, collaboration, and task generalization but also introduce additional risks due to unguaranteed agreement, cascading uncertainty, and adversarial vulnerabilities. We argue that ensuring responsible behavior in such systems requires a paradigm shift: from local, superficial agent-level alignment to global, systemic agreement. We conceptualize responsibility not as a static constraint but as a lifecycle-wide property encompassing agreement, uncertainty, and security, each requiring the complementary integration of subjective human-centered values and objective verifiability. Furthermore, a dual-perspective governance framework that combines interdisciplinary design with human-AI collaborative oversight is essential for tracing and ensuring responsibility throughout the lifecycle of LLM-MAS. Our position views LLM-MAS not as loose collections of agents, but as unified, dynamic socio-technical systems that demand principled mechanisms to support each dimension of responsibility and enable ethically aligned, verifiably coherent, and resilient behavior for sustained, system-wide agreement.</description>

      <title>The Role of Social Learning and Collective Norm Formation in Fostering Cooperation in LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs) explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts, where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and effective governance of AI-mediated environments.</description>

      <title>Joint Active RIS Configuration and User Power Control for Localization: A Neuroevolution-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies user localization aided by a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS). A feedback link from the Base Station (BS) to the user is adopted to enable dynamic power control of the user pilot transmissions in the uplink. A novel multi-agent algorithm for the joint control of the RIS phase configuration and the user transmit power is presented, which is based on a hybrid approach integrating NeuroEvolution (NE) and supervised learning. The proposed scheme requires only single-bit feedback messages for the uplink power control, supports RIS elements with discrete responses, and is numerically shown to outperform fingerprinting, deep reinforcement learning baselines and backpropagation-based position estimators.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agents Enable Autonomous Design and Image Analysis of Microwell Microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwell microfluidics has been utilized for single-cell analysis to reveal heterogeneity in gene expression, signaling pathways, and phenotypic responses for identifying rare cell types, understanding disease progression, and developing more precise therapeutic strategies. However, designing microwell microfluidics is a considerably complex task, requiring knowledge, experience, and CAD software, as well as manual intervention, which often fails initial designs, demanding multiple costly and time-consuming iterations. In this study, we establish an autonomous large language model (LLM)-driven microwell design framework to generate code-based computer-aided design (CAD) scripts, that enables the rapid and reproducible creation of microwells with diverse geometries and imaging-based analysis. We propose a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-logistic regression framework based on integrating high-level semantic descriptions generated by MLLMs with image embeddings for image classification tasks, aiming to identify microwell occupancy and microwell shape. The fused multimodal representation is input to a logistic regression model, which is both interpretable and computationally efficient. We achieved significant improvements, exceeding 0.92 for occupancy classification and 0.99 for shape classification, across all evaluated MLLMs, compared with 0.50 and 0.55, respectively, when relying solely on direct classification. The MLLM-logistic regression framework is a scalable, efficient solution for high-throughput microwell image analysis. Our study demonstrates an autonomous design microwell platform by translating natural language prompts into optimized device geometries, CAD scripts and image analysis, facilitating the development of next-generation digital discovery by integration of literature mining, autonomous design and experimental data analysis.</description>

      <title>GenCellAgent: Generalizable, Training-Free Cellular Image Segmentation via Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool $\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models. It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust, adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing annotation burden and matching user preferences.</description>

      <title>Formalizing the Safety, Security, and Functional Properties of Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical, especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion, providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together, these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17 properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic, these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>When Planners Meet Reality: How Learned, Reactive Traffic Agents Shift nuPlan Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane, interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However, when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.</description>

Abstract: Source seeking is an important topic in robotic research, especially considering sound-based sensors since they allow the agents to locate a target even in critical conditions where it is not possible to establish a direct line of sight. In this work, we design a multi- agent switching mode control strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered: single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent searches for the targets independently from the others.</description>

      <title>SADCHER: Scheduling using Attention-based Dynamic Coalitions of Heterogeneous Robots in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Sadcher, a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams that incorporates dynamic coalition formation and task precedence constraints. Sadcher is trained through Imitation Learning and combines graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards between robots and tasks. Based on the predicted rewards, a relaxed bipartite matching step generates high-quality schedules with feasibility guarantees. We explicitly model robot and task positions, task durations, and robots' remaining processing times, enabling advanced temporal and spatial reasoning and generalization to environments with different spatiotemporal distributions compared to training. Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, our method can scale to larger task sets and team sizes. Sadcher outperforms other learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small and medium-sized teams with computation times suitable for real-time operation. We also explore sampling-based variants and evaluate scalability across robot and task counts. In addition, we release our dataset of 250,000 optimal schedules: https://autonomousrobots.nl/paper_websites/sadcher_MRTA/</description>

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models and vision-language models, AI agents have evolved from isolated, task-specific systems into autonomous, interactive entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting without human intervention. As these agents proliferate across virtual and physical environments, from virtual assistants to embodied robots, the need for a unified, agent-centric infrastructure becomes paramount. In this survey, we introduce the Internet of Agents (IoA) as a foundational framework that enables seamless interconnection, dynamic discovery, and collaborative orchestration among heterogeneous agents at scale. We begin by presenting a general IoA architecture, highlighting its hierarchical organization, distinguishing features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next, we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task matching, consensus and conflict-resolution mechanisms, and incentive models. Finally, we identify open research directions toward building resilient and trustworthy IoA ecosystems.</description>

      <title>ABMax: A JAX-based Agent-based Modeling Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce ABMax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, ABMax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of ABMax</description>

      <title>Inferring Foresightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, specifying how far into the future each agent plans. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in foresightedness, or how much they care about their current cost in relation to their past and future costs. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's foresightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific objective function parametrization that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters to solve for agents' foresightedness. We conduct three experiments: one with synthetically generated delivery robot motion, one with real-world data involving people walking, biking, and driving vehicles, and one using high-fidelity simulators. The results of these experiments demonstrate that explicitly inferring agents' foresightedness enables game-theoretic models to make 33% more accurate models for agents' behavior.</description>

      <title>RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.</description>

      <title>RareAgent: Self-Evolving Reasoning for Drug Repurposing in Rare Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore, knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies, while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions. Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than source identity.

      <title>Ax-Prover: A Deep Reasoning Agentic Framework for Theorem Proving in Mathematics and Quantum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this, Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models (LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers, while it largely outperforms them on the new benchmarks. This shows that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex cryptography theorem.</description>
