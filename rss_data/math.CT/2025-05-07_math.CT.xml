      <title>Lifting couplings in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper makes mathematically precise the idea that conditional probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the category with weights, which one can interpret as "lengths" or "costs", forming a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can interpret as "lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost".</description>

      <title>Biased elementary doctrines and quotient completions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we fill the gap between the elementary quotient completion introduced by Maietti and Rosolini and the exact completion of a category with weak finite limits, as described by Carboni and Vitale. To achieve this, we generalize Lawvere's elementary doctrines to apply to categories with weak finite products, referring to these structures as biased elementary doctrines. We present two main constructions: the first, called strictification, produces an elementary doctrine from a biased one, while the second is an extension of the elementary quotient completion that generalizes the exact completion of a category with weak finite limits, even when weak finite products are involved.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of modules on atomic sites and discrete representations of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish close relations among sheaves of modules on atomic sites, representations of categories, and discrete representations of topological groups. We characterize sheaves of modules on atomic sites as saturated representations, which are precisely representations right perpendicular to torsion representations in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. Consequently, the category of sheaves is equivalent to the Serre quotient of the category of presheaves by the category of torsion presheaves. We also interpret the sheaf cohomology functors as derived functors of the torsion functor and for some special cases as the local cohomology functors. These results as well as a classical theorem of Artin provides us a new approach to study discrete representations of topological groups. In particular, by importing established facts in representation stability theory, we explicitly classify simple or indecomposable injective discrete representations of some topological groups such as the infinite symmetric group, the infinite general or special linear group over a finite field, and the automorphism group of the linearly ordered set $\mathbb{Q}$. We also show that discrete representations $V$ of these topological groups satisfy a certain stability property.</description>

      <title>When is the partial map classifier a Sierpi\'nski cone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between partial map classifiers, Sierpi\'nski cones, and axioms for synthetic higher categories and domains within univalent foundations. In particular, we show that synthetic $\infty$-categories are closed under partial map classifiers assuming Phoa's principle, and we isolate a new reflective subuniverse of types within which the Sierpi\'nski cone (a lax colimit) can be computed as a partial map classifier by strengthening the Segal condition.</description>
