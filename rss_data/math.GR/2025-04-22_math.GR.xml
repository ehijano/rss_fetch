      <title>On dissociated infinite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is threefold. First, we describe the notion of dissociation for closed subgroups of the group of permutations on a countably infinite set and explain its numerous consequences on unitary representations (classification of unitary representations, Property (T), Howe-Moore property, etc.) and on ergodic actions (non-existence of type III non-singular actions, Stabilizer rigidity, etc.). Some of the results presented here are new, others were proved in different contexts. Second, we introduce a new method to prove dissociation. It is based on a reinforcement of the classical notion of strong amalgamation, where we allow to amalgamate over countable sets. Third, we apply this technique of amalgamation to provide new examples of dissociated closed permutation groups, including isometry groups of some metrically homogeneous graphs, automorphism groups of diversities, and more.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and opposition in spherical buildings of exceptional type, V: The $\mathsf{E}_8$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automorphism of a spherical building is called \textit{domestic} if it maps no chamber to an opposite chamber. In previous work the classification of domestic automorphisms in large spherical buildings of types $\mathsf{F}_4$, $\mathsf{E}_6$, and $\mathsf{E}_7$ have been obtained, and in the present paper we complete the classification of domestic automorphisms of large spherical buildings of exceptional type of rank at least~$3$ by classifying such automorphisms in the $\mathsf{E}_8$ case. Applications of this classification are provided, including Density Theorems showing that each conjugacy class in a group acting strongly transitively on a spherical building intersects a very small number of $B$-cosets, with $B$ the stabiliser of a fixed choice of chamber.</description>

      <title>Some questions related to free-by-cyclic groups and tubular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a CAT(0) free-by-cyclic tubular group with one vertex is virtually special, but many of them cannot virtually act freely and cocompactly on CAT(0) cube complexes. This partially confirms a question of Brady--Soroko \cite[Section 9: Question 1]{BS} and answers a question of Lyman \cite[Question 1]{Ly} in the negative. Furthermore, we provide examples of free-by-cyclic groups amalgamated along cyclic subgroups that are not virtually free-by-cyclic. This answers negatively a question of Hagen--Wise \cite[Remark 3.6]{hw}. Lastly, we exhibit an example of a cyclic-subgroup-separable tubular group that does not have the property (VRC) (i.e. every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract). This answers a question of Minasyan \cite[Question 11.6]{min} in the negative.</description>

      <title>On characterization of groups by isomorphism type of Gruenberg-Kegel graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gruenberg-Kegel graph (or the prime graph) $\Gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the graph whose vertex set is the set of prime divisors of $|G|$ and in which two distinct vertices $r$ and $s$ are adjacent if and only if there exists an element of order $rs$ in $G$. A group $G$ is recognizable by isomorphism type of Gruenberg--Kegel graph if for every group $H$ the isomorphism between $\Gamma(H)$ and $\Gamma(G)$ as abstract graphs (i.\,e. unlabeled graphs) implies that $G\cong H$. In this paper, we prove that finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type ${^2}E_6(2)$ and $E_8(q)$ for $q \in \{3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 17\}$ are recognizable by isomorphism type of Gruenberg-Kegel graph.</description>

      <title>On minimal shapes and topological invariants in hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. The main tool is a layer decomposition due to Rietman--Nienhuis--Oitmaa and Moran, which allows us to prove convergence towards the Cheeger constant when these shapes exhaust the lattice. Furthermore, we apply a celebrated result of Floyd--Plotnick, which will allow us to compute the Euler characteristic for these graphs in terms of certain growth functions and the number of $n$-sized animals on those lattices.</description>

      <title>Linear maps preserving product of involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An element of the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ of $n \times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is called an involution if its square equals the identity matrix. Gustafson, Halmos, and Radjavi proved that any product of involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ can be expressed as a product of at most four involutions. In this article, we investigate the bijective linear preservers of the sets of products of two, three, or four involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$.</description>

      <title>A uniform Tits alternative for endomorphisms of the projective line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent article of J.P. Bell, K. Huang, W. Peng and T.J. Tucker establishes an analog of the Tits alternative for semigroups of endomorphisms of the projective line. The proof involves a ping-pong argument on arithmetic height functions. Extending this method, we obtain a uniform version of the same alternative. In particular, we show that semigroups of $\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{P}^{1})$ of exponential growth are of uniform exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Endocabling of involutive solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, with an application to solutions whose diagonal is a cyclic permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce endocabling as a technique to deform involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation (``solutions'', for short) by means of $\lambda$-endomorphisms of their associated permutation brace, thus generalizing the cabling method by Lebed, Vendramin and Ram\'{i}rez. In the first part of the article, we define endocabling and investigate the behaviour of solutions and their invariants under endocabling. In the second part, we apply our findings to solutions of size $n$ whose diagonal map is an $n$-cycle: we will prove that solutions with this property whose size is an odd prime power, are of finite multipermutation level. Furthermore, solutions with this property whose size is a power of $2$, will be proven either to be of finite multipermutation level or to admit an iterated retraction onto a unique solution of size $4$.
  We formulate our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>

      <title>The Diophantine problem in isotropic reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin to study model-theoretic properties of non-split isotropic reductive group schemes. In this paper we show that the base ring $K$ is e-interpretable in the point group $G(K)$ of every sufficiently isotropic reductive group scheme $G$. In particular, the Diophantine problems in $K$ and $G(K)$ are equivalent. We also compute the centralizer of the elementary subgroup of $G(K)$ and the common normalizer of all its root subgroups.</description>

Abstract: In this expository note, we discuss normal generators for mapping class groups of surfaces.

      <title>Sombor Spectrum of Super Graphs defined on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a simple graph $A$ on a group $G$ and an equivalence relation $B$ on $G$, the $B$ super $A$ graph is defined as a simple graph, whose vertex set is $G$ and two vertices $g$, $h$ are adjacent if either they are in the same equivalence class or there exist $g^{\prime} \in[g]$ and $h^{\prime} \in[h]$ such that $g^{\prime}$ and $h^{\prime}$ are adjacent in $A$. In the literature, the $B$ super $A$ graphs have been investigated by considering $A$ to be either power graph, enhanced power graph, or commuting graph and $B$ to be an equality, order or conjugacy relation. In this paper, we investigate the Sombor spectrums of these $B$ super $A$ graphs for certain non-abelian groups, viz. the dihedral group, generalized quaternion group and the semidihedral group, respectively.</description>

      <title>Explicit Lossless Vertex Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the first construction of explicit constant-degree lossless vertex expanders. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and sufficiently large $d$, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of $d$-regular graphs where every small set $S$ of vertices has $(1-\varepsilon)d|S|$ neighbors (which implies $(1-2\varepsilon)d|S|$ unique-neighbors). Our results also extend naturally to construct biregular bipartite graphs of any constant imbalance, where small sets on each side have strong expansion guarantees. The graphs we construct admit a free group action, and hence realize new families of quantum LDPC codes of Lin and M. Hsieh with a linear time decoding algorithm.
  Our construction is based on taking an appropriate product of a constant-sized lossless expander with a base graph constructed from Ramanujan Cayley cubical complexes.</description>

Abstract: It is known that a cocompact special group $G$ does not contain $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ if and only if it is hyperbolic; and it does not contain $\mathbb{F}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$ if and only if it is toric relatively hyperbolic. Pursuing in this direction, we show that $G$ does not contain $\mathbb{F}_2 \times \mathbb{F}_2$ if and only if it is weakly hyperbolic relative to cyclic subgroups, or cyclically hyperbolic for short. This observation motivates the study of cyclically hyperbolic groups, which we initiate in the class of groups acting geometrically on CAT(0) cube complexes. Given such a group $G$, we first prove a structure theorem: $G$ virtually splits as the direct sum of a free abelian group and an acylindrically hyperbolic cubulable group. Next, we prove a strong Tits alternative: every subgroup $H \leq G$ either is virtually abelian or it admits a series $H=H_0 \rhd H_1 \rhd \cdots \rhd H_k$ where $H_k$ is acylindrically hyperbolic and where $H_i/H_{i+1}$ is finite or free abelian. As a consequence, $G$ is SQ-universal and it cannot contain subgroups such that products of free groups and virtually simple groups.</description>

Abstract: Arithmetical properties of a finite group are properties of the group which are defined by its arithmetical parameters such as the order of the group, the element orders and so on. In this paper, we discuss a number of results on arithmetical properties of finite groups and characterizations of finite groups by their arithmetical parameters obtained recently. This paper is based on the talk by the author given in frame of (WM)^2 - World Meeting for Women in Mathematics-2022.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial properties of Gruenberg--Kegel graphs of finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is a finite group, then the spectrum $\omega(G)$ is the set of all element orders of $G$. The prime spectrum $\pi(G)$ is the set of all primes belonging to $\omega(G)$. A simple graph $\Gamma(G)$ whose vertex set is $\pi(G)$ and in which two distinct vertices $r$ and $s$ are adjacent if and only if $rs \in \omega(G)$ is called the Gruenberg-Kegel graph or the prime graph of $G$.
  In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is a group of even order, then the set of vertices which are non-adjacent to $2$ in $\Gamma(G)$ form a union of cliques. Moreover, we decide when a strongly regular graph is isomorphic to the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a finite group. Besides this, we prove that a complete bipartite graph with each part of size at least $3$ can not be isomorphic to the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a finite group.</description>

Abstract: J. S. Wilson proved in 1971 an isomorphism between the structural lattice associated to a group belonging to his second class of groups with every proper quotient finite and the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of Cantor's ternary set. In this paper we generalize this isomorphism to the class of branch groups. Moreover, we show that for every faithful branch action of a group $G$ on a spherically homogeneous rooted tree $T$ there is a canonical $G$-equivariant isomorphism between the Boolean algebra associated with the structure lattice of $G$ and the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of the boundary of $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a connected isotropic reductive not necessarily split $k$-group $\mathcal{G}$ with irreducible relative root system, we construct root group data (RGD) system of affine type for significant subgroups of $\mathcal{G}(k[t,t^{-1}])$, which can be extended to the whole group $\mathcal{G}(k[t,t^{-1}])$ under certain additional requirements. We rely on the relative pinning maps from paper "Elementary subgroups of isotropic reductive groups" by V. Petrov and A. Stavrova to construct the affine root groups. To verify the RGD axioms, we utilize the properties of the affine root groups, and the properties of reflections associated with the $k$-roots of $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Cyclicity, hypercyclicity and randomness in self-similar groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of cyclicity and hypercyclicity in self-similar groups as an analogue of cyclic and hypercyclic vectors for an operator on a Banach space. We derive a sufficient condition for cyclicity of non-finitary automorphisms in contracting discrete automata groups. In the profinite setting we prove that fractal profinite groups may be regarded as measure-preserving dynamical systems and derive a sufficient condition for the ergodicity and the mixing properties of these dynamical systems. Furthermore, we show that a Haar-random element in a super strongly fractal profinite group is hypercyclic almost surely as an application of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for free semigroup actions.</description>

      <title>Graphical models for topological groups: A case study on countable Stone spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analogy with the Cayley graph of a group with respect to a finite generating set or the Cayley--Abels graph of a totally disconnected, locally compact group, we detail countable connected graphs associated to Polish groups that we term Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graphs. A group admitting a Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graph acts on it continuously, coarsely metrically properly and cocompactly by isometries of the path metric. By an expansion of the Milnor--Schwarz lemma, it follows that the group is generated by a coarsely bounded set and the group equipped with a word metric with respect to a coarsely bounded generating set and the graph are quasi-isometric. In other words, groups admitting Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graphs are topological analogues of finitely generated groups. Our goal is to introduce this topological perspective on the work of Rosendal to a geometric group theorist.
  We apply these concepts to homeomorphism groups of countable Stone spaces. We completely characterize when these homeomorphism groups are coarsely bounded, when they are locally bounded (all of them are), and when they admit a Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graph, and if so produce a coarsely bounded generating set.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any surface of genus at least 3 equipped with any choice of framing, the graph of non-separating curves with winding number 0 with respect to the framing is hierarchically hyperbolic but not Gromov hyperbolic. We also describe how to build analogues of the curve graph for marked strata of abelian differentials that capture the combinatorics of their boundaries, analogous to how the curve graph captures the combinatorics of the augmented Teichmueller space. These curve graph analogues are also shown to be hierarchically, but not Gromov, hyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: We investigate expansiveness, topological stability, and shadowing for continuous actions of semigroups on compact Hausdorff spaces. We characterize semigroups for which all full shifts are expansive. We show that every expansive continuous monoid action on a compact Hausdorff space which has the shadowing property is topologically stable, and that a subshift with finite alphabet over a monoid has the shadowing property if and only if it is of finite type.</description>

      <title>Generalized Legendrian racks: Classification, tensors, and knot coloring invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the Legendrian Reidemeister moves. We study algebraic aspects of GL-racks and coloring invariants of Legendrian links.
  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a given rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks. We also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles and the categorical center of GL-racks.
  Then we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.
  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal algebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units. The induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and similarly for medial GL-racks.
  Answering another open question, we use GL-racks to distinguish Legendrian knots whose classical invariants are identical. In particular, we complete the classification of Legendrian $8_{13}$ knots.
  Finally, we use exhaustive search algorithms to classify GL-racks up to order 8.</description>
