      <title>Homological Lemmas in a Non-pointed Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that non-pointed versions of the classical homological lemmas hold in regular protomodular categories equipped with a suitable posetal monocoreflective subcategory. Examples of such categories are all protomodular varieties of universal algebras having more than one constant, like the ones of unitary rings, Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras and MV-algebras, their topological models, and the dual category of every elementary topos.</description>

      <title>Equivalence and Conditional Independence in Atomic Sheaf Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a semantic foundation for logics for reasoning in settings that possess a distinction between equality of variables, a coarser equivalence of variables, and a notion of conditional independence between variables. We show that such relations can be modelled naturally in atomic sheaf toposes.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Games over Relational Structures: The Origin of Game Comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoiler-Duplicator games are used in finite model theory to examine the expressive power of logics. Their strategies have recently been reformulated as coKleisli maps of game comonads over relational structures, providing new results in finite model theory via categorical techniques. We present a novel framework for studying Spoiler-Duplicator games by viewing them as event structures. We introduce a first systematic method for constructing comonads for all one-sided Spoiler-Duplicator games: game comonads are now realised by adjunctions to a category of games, generically constructed from a comonad in a bicategory of game schema (called signature games). Maps of the constructed categories of games are strategies and generalise coKleisli maps of game comonads; in the case of one-sided games they are shown to coincide with suitably generalised homomorphisms. Finally, we provide characterisations of strategies on two-sided Spoiler-Duplicator games; in a common special case they coincide with spans of event structures.</description>

      <title>Group completion via the action $\infty$-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a generalization of Quillen's $S^{-1}S$ construction for arbitrary $E_n$-monoids as an $E_{n-1}$-monoidal $\infty$-category and show that its realization models the group completion provided that $n \geq 2$. We will also show how this construction is related to a variety of other constructions of the group completion.</description>

      <title>K-theory and lozalizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>

      <title>Scoped Effects as Parameterized Algebraic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Notions of computation can be modelled by monads. Algebraic effects offer a characterization of monads in terms of algebraic operations and equational axioms, where operations are basic programming features, such as reading or updating the state, and axioms specify observably equivalent expressions. However, many useful programming features depend on additional mechanisms such as delimited scopes or dynamically allocated resources. Such mechanisms can be supported via extensions to algebraic effects including scoped effects and parameterized algebraic theories. We present a fresh perspective on scoped effects by translation into a variation of parameterized algebraic theories. The translation enables a new approach to equational reasoning for scoped effects and gives rise to an alternative characterization of monads in terms of generators and equations involving both scoped and algebraic operations. We demonstrate the power of our fresh perspective by way of equational characterizations of several known models of scoped effects.</description>
