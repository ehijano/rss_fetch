      <title>Fundamental limitations of thermoradiative energy conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental limits of various energy conversion approaches is essential for assessing their efficiency and power output. In this work, we derive general performance bounds for thermoradiative heat engines that exchange heat radiatively with a cold sink, establishing power-versus-efficiency thermodynamic bounds for several configurations. We find that the performance of these engines is always bounded by that of radiative engines, which harness the thermal radiation emitted by a hot source, making thermoradiative engines inherently less favorable for energy conversion. By unifying the results of radiative and thermoradiative engines within a common thermodynamic framework, which also encompasses dual-engine configurations that combine both features, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamic limits of radiative energy conversion. Our framework offers general metrics for evaluating specific devices and raises critical questions regarding the relevance of thermoradiative cells for energy production.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Link Between Nanomorphology and Energetic Disorder in 3D Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is highly sensitive to both nanomorphology and energetic disorder arising from microscopic molecular packing and structural defects. However, most models used to understand these devices are either one-dimensional effective medium approximations that neglect spatial and energetic disorder or three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations that are computationally intensive. In this work, we present the results from a three-dimensional hybrid model capable of operating at both high carrier densities and incorporating the effects of energetic disorder. We first generate realistic morphologies using a phase-field approach that accounts for solvent evaporation during film formation. Using these example morphologies, we systematically study the interplay between energetic disorder and configurational disorder at carrier densities representative of real device operation. This enables us to separate and visualize the impact of the nanomorphology and energetic disorder on device performance. Our results reveal that, even when macroscopic percolation pathways remain intact, energetic disorder limits performance primarily through suppressed charge extraction in interconnected domains. This suggest that optimizing molecular packing at the nanoscale is as critical as controlling phase separation at the mesoscale, highlighting the need for multiscale design strategies in next-generation BHJ devices.</description>

      <title>Device-scale modeling of valley photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Poisson/drift-diffusion model that includes valley scattering effects for simulating valley photovoltaic devices. The valley photovoltaic concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.</description>

      <title>Thermal quench modeling of REBCO racetrack coils under conduction cooling at 30 K for aircraft electric propulsion motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconducting (HTS) racetrack coils are promising components for lightweight, high-power electric machines due to their exceptional current-carrying capacity. However, self-heating due to AC loss or DC short circuits can cause electro-thermal quench, which poses a significant challenge for the design and reliability of superconducting motors. Here, we apply an electro-magneto-thermal computational approach that integrates the Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) method for electromagnetic modelling with the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for electrothermal analyses. The investigation focuses on the response of an HTS racetrack coil subjected to DC voltages ranging from low (1 V) to high values (1000 V) at operating temperature of 30 K. Computations were conducted under two thermal boundary conditions: complete adiabatic conditions and cooling applied to one side of the coil with the top surface at 30 K. We found that at higher voltages, the current exceeds the critical value, causing rapid thermal runaway that damages the superconducting material. In contrast, at lower voltages, the coil presents periodic oscillations in current and temperature, demonstrating a complex interplay of thermal diffusion and electromagnetic stability. This study provides critical insights into the thermal management and fault response of HTS coils for aviation applications, particularly in the design of superconducting motors for electric aircraft.</description>

      <title>On the surface Bloch waves in truncated periodic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much like their counterparts in elastic solids, waves in periodic media can be broadly classified into Floquet-Bloch body waves, and evanescent surface waves. Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface Bloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann data. To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients as a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model of the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms, and ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a geometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the surface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber normal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber in the direction of the SB wave. In this way the sought boundary layer is derived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose strengths are obtained by imposing the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. With the QEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both dispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a low-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration of the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of the SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut. For completeness, our analysis includes an account for the power flow and ``skin depth'' of a surface Bloch wave, both of which are critical for the energetic relevance of boundary layers.</description>

      <title>A Wide-Input 0.25 um BCD LDO with Dual-Stage Amplifier and Active Ripple Cancellation for High PSRR and Fast Transient Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand for on-chip low-dropout regulators (LDOs) with both high power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and fast transient response is growing as system-on-chip (SoC) integration increases. However, conventional LDO architectures face difficulty achieving these performance metrics simultaneously over wide input voltage ranges. This paper presents a wide-input linear regulator implemented in 0.25 um BCD technology that attains high PSRR and swift load-transient performance while maintaining low quiescent current. The proposed LDO employs a dual-stage error amplifier architecture and active ripple cancellation along both the power path and the error amplifier's supply to significantly enhance PSRR across frequency. An adaptive fast feedback branch together with an on-chip frequency compensation network is introduced to accelerate transient response without compromising stability. A two-stage PSRR analytical model and a three-frequency-band PSRR interpretation framework are developed to guide the design. Cadence Spectre simulations of the 14 V-output LDO demonstrate a -75 dB low-frequency PSRR, and during a 50 uA - 4 mA load step the output voltage droop is kept under 0.65 V with recovery within 16 us. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and analysis, indicating that the design meets the stringent requirements of analog/RF SoCs and portable electronics.</description>

      <title>Energy recovery from Ginkgo biloba urban pruning wastes: pyrolysis optimization and fuel property enhancement for high grade charcoal productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ginkgo biloba trees are widely planted in urban areas of developed countries for their resilience, longevity and aesthetic appeal. Annual pruning to control tree size, shape and interference with traffic and pedestrians generates large volumes of unutilized Ginkgo biomass. This study aimed to valorize these pruning residues into charcoal by optimizing pyrolysis conditions and evaluating its fuel properties. The pyrolysis experiment was conducted at 400 to 600 degrees Celsius, after oven drying pretreatment. The mass yield of charcoal was found to vary from 27.33 to 32.05 percent and the approximate volume shrinkage was found to be 41.19 to 49.97 percent. The fuel properties of the charcoals were evaluated using the moisture absorption test, proximate and ultimate analysis, thermogravimetry, calorimetry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The calorific value improved from 20.76 to 34.26 MJ per kg with energy yield up to 46.75 percent. Charcoal exhibited superior thermal stability and better combustion performance. The results revealed satisfactory properties compared with other biomass, coal and biochar standards. The product complied with first grade standards at 550 and 600 degrees Celsius and second grade wood charcoal standards at other temperatures. However, higher concentrations of some heavy metals like Zn indicate the need for pretreatment and further research on copyrolysis for resource optimization. This study highlights the dual benefits of waste management and renewable energy, providing insights for urban planning and policymaking.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond Engineering of magnetic Domain Walls via Nonequilibrium Spin Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical control of magnetic textures offers new opportunities for energy-efficient, high-speed spintronic devices. While uniform magnetization reversal via all-optical switching is well established, the formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) under ultrafast excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we use Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation to directly image the real-time formation of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. We observe a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs form and spontaneously vanish within picoseconds. Multiscale simulations combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics reveal a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs. This nonequilibrium mechanism explains the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering, and establishes a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials on femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations of Short-range Ordering with Light Interstitials in Inconel Superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employed hybrid Monte Carlo Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the short-range ordering behavior of Ni-based superalloys doped with boron or carbon. The simulations revealed that both boron and carbon dissociated from their host Ti atoms to achieve energetically favored ordering with Cr, Mo, and Nb. Boron clusters formed as B2, surrounded by Mo, Nb, and Cr, while carbon preferentially clustered with Cr to form a Cr23C6 local motif and with Nb to form Nb2C. Distinct preferences for interstitial sites were observed, with boron favoring tetrahedral sites and carbon occupying octahedral sites. In the presence of a vacancy, B2 shifted from the tetrahedral site to the vacancy, where it remained coordinated with Mo, Nb, and Cr. Similarly, carbon utilized vacancies to form Nb2C clusters. Excess energy calculations showed that B and C exhibited strong thermodynamic stability within their short-range ordered configurations. However, under Ti-rich conditions, C was more likely to segregate into TiC, despite preexisting ordering with Cr. This shift in stability suggests that increased Ti availability would alter carbide formation pathways, drawing C away from Cr-rich networks and promoting the development of TiC. Such redistribution may disrupt the continuity of Cr-based carbide networks, which play a critical role in stabilizing grain boundaries and impeding crack propagation. These effects further underscore the impact of interstitial-induced ordering on phase stability and microstructural evolution. This work provides an atomistic perspective on how boron- and carbon-induced ordering influences microstructure and mechanical properties. These findings highlight the critical role of interstitial-induced short-range ordering and demonstrate that this mechanism can be leveraged as a design principle to fine-tune alloy microstructures for specific engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers, formed by tightly focused propagating laser beams, offer the unique capability to trap and control microscopic particles over a broad size range. However, the diffraction inherent to propagating optical fields, limits the resulting resolution and the accuracy of particle manipulation. Here we show that the phenomenon of ``auto-focusing'' inherent to hyperbolic materials in cylinder geometry, can be used for spatial control with nanometer accuracy. Furthermore, due to highly efficient light focusing in hyperbolic media that is not restricted by diffraction, the resulting electromagnetically induced forces exceed those of conventional optical tweezers by several orders of magnitude, which allows more efficient particle manipulation at reduced illumination intensity.</description>

      <title>Noise-Limited Sensitivity in Cavity Optomechanical Molecular Sensing Enabled by Quantum Zero-Point Displacement Coupling and Strong Photon-Phonon Interaction for Chiral Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a quantum-limited optomechanical sensing platform for real-time detection and discrimination of chiral molecules, based on a multilayer hybrid plasmonic-mechanical resonator. Leveraging quantum zero-point motion and engineered photon-phonon interactions, the system achieves ultrahigh displacement sensitivity that approaches the fundamental quantum limit. The multilayer architecture, composed of alternating dielectric and metallic films, supports mechanical resonances with quality factors reaching approximately ten thousand in the megahertz frequency range. These resonances coherently modulate the optical field through radiation pressure and dynamical backaction. Power spectral density measurements reveal distinct mechanical peaks at 0.68, 2.9, 4.3, 5.5, and 6.8 MHz, with optomechanical coupling strengths exceeding twice the intrinsic baseline, enabling highly efficient signal transduction. Lorentzian fitting confirms the presence of sharp mechanical linewidths, while the total force noise, including thermal, shot, and technical contributions, remains below the threshold required for detecting sub-piconewton forces. Time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, which is typically insensitive to chirality, here reveals enantioselective dynamics arising from asymmetric optomechanical interactions, enabling clear spectral distinction between d- and l-enantiomers. Finite-element simulations validate the strong spatial overlap between optical confinement and mechanical displacement modes. This platform offers a scalable and tunable approach to quantum-limited, high-sensitivity chiral molecule detection, with applications in coherent control, precision spectroscopy, and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>On-chip Single-crystal Plasmonic Optoelectronics for Efficient Hot Carrier Collection and Photovoltage Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-area chemically synthesized single-crystal metals with nanometer-scale thickness have emerged as promising materials for on-chip nanophotonic applications, owing to their superior plasmonic properties compared to nanofabricated polycrystalline counterparts. While much recent attention has focused on their optical properties, the combined optimal electrical and optical characteristics, which hold great potential for high-performance optoelectronic functionalities, remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a single-crystal plasmonic optoelectronic platform based on nanowires fabricated from synthesized gold flakes and demonstrate its capabilities for highly enhanced hot carrier collection, electroluminescence, and photovoltage detection. Notably, single-crystal gold nanogap devices exhibit an order of magnitude higher open-circuit photovoltage compared to polycrystalline devices, representing one of the highest reported photovoltage sensing performances in terms of on-chip device density and responsivity per area. Our analysis revealed that this enhancement is attributed mostly to the suppression of electron-phonon scattering and improved hot carrier tunneling efficiency in single-crystal devices. These results highlight the potential of large-scale single-crystal nanostructures for both fundamental studies of nanoscale hot carrier transport and scalable electrically driven nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Integrated Spectropolarimeter by Metasurface-Based Diffractive Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional spectrometer and polarimeter systems rely on bulky optics, fundamentally limiting compact integration and hindering multi-dimensional optical sensing capabilities. Here, we propose a spectropolarimeter enabled by metasurface-based diffractive optical networks that simultaneously performs spectrometric and polarimetric measurements in a compact device. By leveraging the wavelength- and polarization-dependent phase modulation of metasurfaces, our system encodes the spectral and polarization information of incident light into spatially resolved intensity distributions, which are subsequently decoded by a trained deep neural network, enabling simultaneous high-accuracy reconstruction of both spectral compositions and Stokes parameters through a single-shot measurement. Experiments validate the proposed network's accurate reconstruction of the spectral and polarization information across a broad wavelength range, and further confirm its imaging capability. Notably, we demonstrate a chip-integrated sensor prototype combing both measurement functionalities into a commercial CMOS image sensor. This integrated platform provides a compact solution for on-chip multi-dimensional optical sensing, holding significant potential for versatile sensing, biomedical diagnosis, and industrial metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks on Arbitrary Spatial Networks with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms provide a highly promising platform for quantum computation, leveraging their strong tunable interactions to encode and manipulate information in the electronic states of individual atoms. Key advantages of Rydberg atoms include scalability, reconfigurable connectivity, and native multi-qubit gates, making them particularly well-suited for addressing complex network problems. These problems can often be framed as graph-based tasks, which can be efficiently addressed using quantum walks. In this work, we propose a general implementation of staggered quantum walks with Rydberg atoms, with a particular focus on spatial networks. We also present an efficient algorithm for constructing the tessellations required for the staggered quantum walk. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposal achieves quadratic speedup in spatial search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Strain Effects in a Directly Bonded Diamond-on-Insulator Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. This study investigates strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO$_2$/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of $\approx$0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of $\approx$0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Key Design Factors for Thermal Comfort in Underground Space Through Global Sensitivity Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study identified the key design factors related to thermal comfort in naturally ventilated underground spaces under high temperature condition (outdoor Tmax = 42.9$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) in Fuzhou, China. Fuzhou has a humid subtropical climate and is one of the three hottest cities in China in 2024. The reference roof measurement point showed the highest heat exposure (36.3% &gt;35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) followed by pedestrian-level areas (20.4% &gt;35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$), while the underground remained consistently cooler (0% &gt;35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) in environmental conditions (e.g., AT, GT, MRT, V, RH). Underground spaces showed the most stable and lowest PET (mean PET = 35.4$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) due to high thermal mass and shading, although moderate to intense thermal stresses still existed. Pedestrian-level spaces displayed greater PET variation (mean = 37.4$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) influenced by direct and diffuse solar radiation, while roofs suffered from extreme heat stress (mean PET = 40.6$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) peaking at 100% frequency from 9:00 to 14:00. Four distinct periods including early morning transition, evening transition, cooling, and heat stressing were identified for optimal underground space utilization as heat shelter. The global sensitivity analysis showed that variations in MET explained 60% of the variance in PET within the underground environment, followed by AT (20%), V (10%), MRT (5%), and RH (5%). The partial dependence analysis indicated that PET in underground space rose by approximately 7$^\circ\mathrm{C}$ when MET increased from 1 to 5 met, while a 1 m/s rise in V led to a 2$^\circ\mathrm{C}$ reduction in PET, suggesting shaded areas with good ventilation can significantly improve thermal comfort even if AT remains moderately high.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A highly effective method of the device linearity calculation on the stage of the device development is worked out and reported. The method allows expressing the linearity in terms of the achievable spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the created devices, in particular superconductive electronic devices, and therefore can be easy correlated with the obtained experimental data. The algorithm scheme and the method accuracy are considered and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Programming of refractive functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snell's law dictates the phenomenon of light refraction at the interface between two media. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary programming of light refraction through an engineered material where the direction of the output wave can be set independently for different directions of the input wave, covering arbitrarily selected permutations of light refraction between the input and output apertures. Formed by a set of cascaded transmissive layers with optimized phase profiles, this refractive function generator (RFG) spans only a few tens of wavelengths in the axial direction. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions, where a distinct refractive function is implemented at each wavelength through the same engineered material volume, i.e., the permutation of light refraction is switched from one desired function to another function by changing the illumination wavelength. As experimental proofs of concept, we demonstrate permutation and negative refractive functions at the terahertz part of the spectrum using 3D-printed materials. Arbitrary programming of refractive functions enables new design capabilities for optical materials, devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dynamics of Sub-Millisecond Electroadhesive Engagement and Release Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroadhesive clutches are electrically controllable switchable adhesives commonly used in soft robots and haptic user interfaces. They can form strong bonds to a wide variety of surfaces at low power consumption. However, electroadhesive clutches in the literature engage to and release from substrates several orders of magnitude slower than a traditional electrostatic model would predict. Large release times, in particular, can limit electroadhesion's usefulness in high-bandwidth applications. We develop a novel electromechanical model for electroadhesion, factoring in polarization dynamics, the drive circuitry's rise and fall times, and contact mechanics between the dielectric and substrate. We show in simulation and experimentally how different design parameters affect the engagement and release times of centimeter-scale electroadhesive clutches to metallic substrates, and we find that the model accurately captures the magnitude and trends of our experimental results. In particular, we find that higher drive frequencies, narrower substrate aspect ratios, and faster drive circuitry output stages enable significantly faster release times. The fastest clutches have engagement times less than 15 us and release times less than 875 us, which are 10x and 17.1x faster, respectively, than the best times found in prior literature on centimeter-scale electroadhesive clutches.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Grey Wolf Differential Evolution Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Low loss monolithic barium titanate on insulator integrated photonics with intrinsic quality factor &gt;1 million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BTO) has been experiencing a surge of interest for integrated photonics technologies because of its large nonlinear optical coefficients, especially the Pockels coefficient, and in part due to newly available thin-film substrates. In this work, we report on the development of a redeposition-free dry etching technique for monolithic BTO-on-insulator photonics, that produces very low-roughness and high-verticality waveguides. Using this, we experimentally demonstrate the first BTO microresonators with intrinsic Q-factor $&gt; 1$ million, and waveguide propagation loss as small as 0.32 dB/cm, representing the lowest losses reported in any BTO-based integrated platform to date. We additionally demonstrate Mach-Zehnder amplitude modulators with $V_{\pi}L = 0.54$ V$\cdot$cm and effective electro-optic coefficient $r_\text{eff} = 162$ pm/V.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mobility in Spatial Biodiversity Models through Recurrence Quantification Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrence plots and their associated quantifiers provide a robust framework for detecting and characterising complex patterns in non-linear time-series. In this paper, we employ recurrence quantification analysis to investigate the dynamics of the cyclic, non-hierarchical May-Leonard model, also referred to as rock--paper--scissors systems, that describes competitive interactions among three species. A crucial control parameter in these systems is the species' mobility $m$, which governs the spatial displacement of individuals and profoundly influences the resulting dynamics. By systematically varying $m$ and constructing suitable recurrence plots from numerical simulations, we explore how recurrence quantifiers reflect distinct dynamical features associated with different ecological states. We then introduce an ensemble-based approach that leverages statistical distributions of recurrence quantifiers, computed from numerous independent realisations, allowing us to identify dynamical outliers as significant deviations from typical system behaviour. Through detailed numerical analyses, we demonstrate that these outliers correspond to divergent ecological regimes associated with specific mobility values, providing also a robust manner to infer the mobility parameter from observed numerical data. Our results highlight the potential of recurrence-based methods as diagnostic tools for analysing spatial ecological systems and extracting ecologically relevant information from their non-linear dynamical patterns.</description>
