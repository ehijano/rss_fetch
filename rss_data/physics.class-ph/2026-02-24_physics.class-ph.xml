      <title>Damped harmonic oscillator revisited: a new approach to energy decay in the case of Coulomb, Stokes, and Newton damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate formulas are derived to describe energy loss in a harmonic oscillator that experiences three distinct damping mechanisms: constant-magnitude (Coulomb), velocity-proportional (Stokes), and velocity-squared (Newton), using fundamental mathematical methods and physical insight. Our methodology leverages an understanding of the free harmonic oscillator and the inherent link between energy dissipation rates and the power exerted by damping forces. We establish a direct analytical framework for assessing the energy of a damped harmonic oscillator, obviating the need for amplitude-based equations. The simplicity of our findings is accompanied by their remarkable accuracy when validated against exact or computational simulations. In addition to an excellent approximate description of the energy decay, we also show how to derive an exact solution in the case of Stokes damping without relying on the standard procedure for solving second-order differential equations. The theoretical underpinnings and mathematical strategies employed are well-suited for undergraduate-level or advanced high school physics instruction.</description>

      <title>On the adiabatic invariance of the trapped wave's action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown (Gavrilov et al., Nonlinear Dyn, 112, 2024) that in a linear continuum system with time-varying parameters, the amplitude of a strongly localized mode can be calculated as a function of current parameter values and does not depend on the history of parameters change. This fact allows one to introduce the adiabatic invariant for such a system according to the general definition as a quantity that remains approximately constant in a system with several slowly time-varying parameters. In this paper, we show that, introduced in such a way, the adiabatic invariant can be calculated as the ratio of localized mode energy and its frequency. This yields a dramatically simplified way to solve a class of problems concerning localized oscillation of continuum systems with discrete inclusions, although it is not always clear enough what "the mode energy" is. The observed fact allows one to consider newly introduced adiabatic invariants as a straightforward generalization of a notion known to Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Twisted multilayer moir\'e water waves topologically robust to disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, stacking and twisting multilayer periodic lattices into superlattices, have become cornerstones of many physical systems from condensed matter to wave phenomena, but have never been properly studied in water waves. Here, we demonstrate twisted multilayer moir\'e water surface waves carrying robust skyrmionic topologies. Using a custom water tank of circular multi-channel phased array, we precisely generate water-wave skyrmion lattices and superimpose them into moir\'e superlattices with higher-order topological textures, e.g., skyrmion bags and clusters, programmed via the twist angle. We also quantitatively compare the topological robustness of bilayer and trilayer configurations under spatiotemporal perturbations. The trilayer moir\'e superlattices exhibit more enhanced stability, stronger field localization and energy concentration than the bilayer. Our work establishes water waves as a macroscopic, tunable, and visually accessible platform for moir\'e physics, towards robust particle manipulation and classical analogues of topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This text is the support for the course of Modeling of Solids, of the Master of Mechanics of the University Paris-Saclay - Curriculum MMM: Mathematical Methods for Mechanics, held at Versailles. The course is the continuation of the course Continuum Mechanics - Solids, and as such it is an introduction, for graduate students, to some typical topics of the theory of solid bodies. The different arguments are dealt with in a simple, succinct way, the objective being to give to students the fundamentals of each argument. Only static problems are considered, being the dynamic of structures dealt with in other courses.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</description>
