      <title>Coordinating cooperation in stag-hunt game: Emergence of evolutionarily stable procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are bounded rational at best and this, we argue, has worked in their favour in the hunter-gatherer society where emergence of a coordinated action, leading to cooperation, is otherwise the standard stag-hunt dilemma (when individuals are rational). In line with the fact the humans strive for developing self-reputation by having less propensity to cheat than to be cheated, we observe that the payoff structure of the stag-hunt game appropriately modifies to that of coordination-II game. Subsequently, within the paradigm of evolutionary game theory, we establish that a population -- consisting of procedural rational players (a type of bounded rationality) -- is unequivocally evolutionarily stable against emergence of more rational strategies in coordination-II game. The cooperation is, thus, shown to have been established by evolutionary forces picking less rational individuals.</description>

      <title>A control theoretical approach to gene regulation raises quantitative constraints for dynamic homeostasis in stochastic gene expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell phenotype dynamic homeostasis contrasts with the inherent randomness of intracellular reactions. Although feedback control of master regulatory genes (MRG) is a key strategy for maintaining gene network expression ranges limited, understanding the quantitative constraints and corresponding mechanisms enabling such a dynamic stability under noise remains elusive. Here we model MRG expression as a stochastic process and downstream genes as sensors which response conditionally induce MRG activity. We show that at homeostatic regime: i. the trajectories of the MRG expression levels can be adjusted towards specific ranges using both the exact solutions of the stochastic model and the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA); ii. there exists a sampling rate which optimizes the feedback control of the MRG activity, and non-optimal controls resulting in alternative homeostatic dynamics; iii. the feedback control of MRG activity leads to updates which intensities and time intervals are non-linearly related; iv. the ON state probability of an MRG promoter has dynamics confined within a narrow domain. Our results help to understand the quantitative constraints underpinning dynamic homeostasis despite randomness, the mechanisms underlying alternative, non-optimal, homeostatic regimes, and may be useful for theoretically prototyping therapies aiming at gene networks modulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of binding three independent ligands to a single scaffold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note considers a system in which three ligands can independently bind to a scaffold. Such systems arise in diverse applications, including immunotherapy and synthetic biology. It is shown that there are unique steady states in each conservation class, and these are asymptotically stable. The dependency of the steady-state amount of fully bound complex, as a function of total scaffold, is analyzed as well.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation of methods to analyze motion changes in single-particle experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments can reveal valuable information about the heterogeneity of transport processes and interactions between cell components. These characteristics are seen as motion changes in the particle trajectories. Despite the existence of multiple approaches to carry out this type of analysis, no objective assessment of these methods has been performed so far. Here, we report the results of a competition to characterize and rank the performance of these methods when analyzing the dynamic behavior of single molecules. To run this competition, we implemented a software library that simulates realistic data corresponding to widespread diffusion and interaction models, both in the form of trajectories and videos obtained in typical experimental conditions. The competition constitutes the first assessment of these methods, providing insights into the current limitations of the field, fostering the development of new approaches, and guiding researchers to identify optimal tools for analyzing their experiments.</description>
