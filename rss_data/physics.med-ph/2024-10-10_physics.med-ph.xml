      <title>Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: A Novel Tool for Assessing Daily Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement Integrating Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elevated stress negatively impacts health, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, weak immunity, anxiety, and cognitive decline. Current lab-based methods lack real-time stress measurement, while saliva diagnostics offers a convenient and non-invasive alternative. This work proposes repurposing dental floss as a thread-analytical saliva diagnostic device. This method uses flossing to collect and transport saliva to a flexible electrochemical sensor via capillary microfluidics, where cortisol, a stress biomarker, is measured. By integrating an electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymer specific to cortisol (cort-eMIP) on a porous-laser-engraved-graphene (PLEG) working electrode, the saliva-floss platform shows a detection range of 0.10-10000 pg mL-1 (R2 = 0.9916) with a detection limit of 0.023 pg mL-1 for cortisol (in buffer medium). The saliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 5 minutes. The thread-based microfluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability when testing artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64 to 102.4 percent recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%, demonstrating high accuracy and precision. Validated using human saliva samples in a stress study, it showed a high correlation (r= 0.9910) with conventional ELISA assays. Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a convenient way to monitor daily stress levels and can be extended to detect other critical salivary biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Simulating the blood transfusion system in Kenya: Modelling methods and exploratory analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of collecting blood from donors and making it available for transfusion requires a complex series of operations involving multiple actors and resources at each step. Ensuring hospitals receive adequate and safe blood for transfusion is a common challenge across low- and middle-income countries, but is rarely addressed from a system level. This paper presents the first use of discrete event simulation to study the blood system in Kenya and to explore the effect of variations and perturbations at different steps of the system on meeting patient blood demand. A process map of the Kenyan blood system was developed to capture critical steps from blood donation to transfusion using interviews with blood bank, hospital, and laboratory personnel at four public hospitals across three counties in Kenya. The blood system was simulated starting with blood collection, a blood bank where blood is tested and stored before it is issued, a major hospital attached to the blood bank, and several smaller hospitals served by the same blood bank. Values for supply-side parameters were based mainly on expert opinion; demand-side parameters were based on data from blood requisitions made in hospital wards, and dispatch of blood from the hospital laboratory. Illustrative examples demonstrate how the model can be used to explore the impacts of changes in blood collection (e.g., prioritising different donor types), blood demand (e.g., differing clinical case mix), and blood distribution (e.g., restocking strategies) on meeting demand at patient level. The model can reveal potential process impediments in the blood system and aid in choosing strategies for improving blood collection, distribution or use. Such a systems approach allows for interventions at different steps in the blood continuum to be tested on blood availability for different patients presenting at diverse hospitals across the country.</description>

      <title>A 3D-Printed Table for Hybrid X-ray CT and Optical Imaging of a Live Mouse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal imaging has shown great potential in cancer research by concurrently providing anatomical, functional, and molecular information in live, intact animals. During preclinical imaging of small animals like mice, anesthesia is required to prevent movement and improve image quality. However, their high surface area-to-body weight ratio predisposes mice, particularly nude mice, to hypothermia under anesthesia. To address this, we developed a detachable mouse scanning table with heating function for hybrid x-ray and optical imaging modalities, without introducing metal artifacts. Specifically, we employed Polylactic Acid (PLA) 3D printing technology to fabricate a customized scanning table, compatible with both CT and optical imaging systems. This innovation enables seamless transportation of the table between different imaging setups, while its detachable design facilitates maintaining a clutter-free operational environment within the imaging systems. This is crucial for accommodating various projects within the same scanner. The table features positioned fixation points to secure mice, ensuring positional consistency across imaging modalities. Additionally, we integrated a carbon nanotube-based heating pad into the table to regulate the body temperature of mice during examinations, providing an ethical and effective temperature maintenance solution. Our evaluations confirmed the table's ability to maintain a 30g water bag at approximately 40$^\circ$C, effectively regulating mouse body temperature to an optimal 36$^\circ$C during preclinical imaging sessions. This scanning table serves as a useful tool in preclinical cancer research, offering a versatile tool that upholds animal welfare standards.</description>

      <title>Methods for Few-View CT Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is an essential non-destructive three dimensional imaging modality used in medicine, security screening, and inspection of manufactured components. Typical CT data acquisition entails the collection of a thousand or more projections through the object under investigation through a range of angles covering one hundred eighty degrees or more. It may be desirable or required that the number of projections angles be reduced by one or two orders of magnitude for reasons such as acquisition time or dose. Unless specialized reconstruction algorithms are applied, reconstructing with fewer views will result in streak artifacts and failure to resolve object boundaries at certain orientations. These artifacts may substantially diminish the usefulness of the reconstructed CT volumes.
  Here we develop constrained and regularized numerical optimization methods to reconstruct CT volumes from 4-28 projections. These methods entail utilization of novel data fidelity and convex and non-convex regularization terms. In addition, the methods outlined here are usually carried out by a sequence of two or three numerical optimization methods in sequence.
  The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated on four measured and three simulated few-view CT data sets. We show that these methods outperform other state of the art few-view numerical optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Proton arc therapy plan optimization with energy layer pre-selection driven by organ at risk sparing and delivery time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. As proton arc therapy (PAT) approaches clinical implementation, optimizing treatment plans for this innovative delivery modality remains challenging, especially in addressing arc delivery time. Existing algorithms for minimizing delivery time are either optimal but computationally demanding or fast but at the expense of sacrificing many degrees of freedom. In this study, we introduce a flexible method for pre-selecting energy layers (EL) in PAT treatment planning before the actual robust spot weight optimization. Our EL pre-selection method employs metaheuristics to minimize a bi-objective function, considering a dynamic delivery time proxy and tumor geometrical coverage penalized as a function of selected organs-at-risk crossing. It is capable of parallelizing multiple instances of the problem. We evaluate the method using three different treatment sites, providing a comprehensive dosimetric analysis benchmarked against dynamic proton arc plans generated with early energy layer selection and spot assignment (ELSA) and IMPT plans in RayStation TPS. The algorithm efficiently generates Pareto-optimal EL pre-selections in approximately 5 minutes. Subsequent PAT treatment plans derived from these selections and optimized within the TPS, demonstrate high-quality target coverage, achieving a high conformity index, and effective sparing of organs at risk. These plans meet clinical goals while achieving a 20 to 40% reduction in delivery time compared to ELSA plans. The proposed algorithm offers speed and efficiency, producing high-quality PAT plans by placing proton arc sectors to efficiently reduce delivery time while maintaining good target coverage and healthy tissues sparing.</description>
