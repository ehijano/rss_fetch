      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. We additionally observe that moving to strong cavity field gradients leads to an instability towards a sliding Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, featuring a strong density modulation in the gradient direction. Finally, by exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometry of the Haldane Model under a Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Capillary condensation between non-parallel walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the condensation of fluids confined by a pair of non-parallel plates of finite height $H$. We show that such a system experiences two types of condensation, termed single- and double-pinning, which can be characterized by one (single-pinning) or two (double-pinning) edge contact angles describing the shape of menisci pinned at the system edges. For both types of capillary condensation we formulate the Kelvin-like equation and determine the conditions under which the given type of condensation occurs. We construct the global phase diagram revealing a reentrant phenomenon pertinent to the change of the capillary condensation type upon varying the inclination of the walls. Asymptotic properties of the system are discussed and a link with related phase phenomena in different systems is made. Finally, we show that the change from a single- to a double-pinned state is a continuous transition, the character of which depends on the wetting properties of the walls.</description>

      <title>Correlated insulators and charge density wave states in chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of displacement-field-tuned correlated insulators at integer and half-integer fillings in chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene (CTTBG), we study the single-particle and interacting physics of CTTBG. We find that there are two inequivalent stacking orders, {\it i.e.}, ABABBC and ABABAB, and both exhibit flat bands with nontrivial topology. We then use the Hartree-Fock approximation to calculate the rich phase diagram of CTTBG at all integer and half-integer fillings in both stacking orders and under the vertical displacement field. Under a small displacement field, the groundstates are flavor polarized states for ABABBC stacking order and intervalley coherent states for ABABAB stacking order at all integer and half-integer fillings. A larger displacement field will turn them into layer-polarized states. At half-integer fillings, the groundstates also exhibit charge density wave (CDW) order. For ABABAB stacking, the groundstates are always $2\times1$ stripe state among a range of displacement fields. For ABABBC stacking, the groundstates are also $2\times1$ stripe states under a small displacement field and a larger displacement will possibly favor further translation-symmetry-breaking, depending on filling and the direction of the displacement field. We demonstrate that the CDW states observed in the experiment can originate from the strong Coulomb interaction of the flat band electrons.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of the heat capacity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory and mechanistic understanding of the thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently missing. We develop a theoretical quantum confinement description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for the heat capacity. In particular, due to the suppression of vibrational modes caused by the thin film confinement, the vibrational density of states (VDOS) deviates from the Debye quadratic law in frequency and is, instead, cubic in frequency. This leads to a temperature dependence of the heat capacity which is $\sim T^4$ instead of Debye's $\sim T^3$ law. Furthermore, the new theory predicts a linear increase of the heat capacity upon increasing the nanometric film thickness. Both dependencies are found in excellent agreement with recent experimental data on NbTiN thin films.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the local mechanical properties of twisted double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical measurements of minimally twisted van der Waals materials remained elusive despite their fundamental importance for device realisation. Here, we use Ultrasonic Force Microscopy (UFM) to locally quantify the variation of out-of-plane Young's modulus in minimally twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG). We reveal a softening of the Young's modulus by 7\% and 17\% along single and double domain walls, respectively. Our experimental results are confirmed by force-field relaxation models. This study highlights the strong tunability of nanomechanical properties in engineered twisted materials, and paves the way for future applications of designer 2D nanomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Determining the purity of single-helical proteins from electronic specific heat measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the electronic specific heat (ESH) at constant volume (Cv) of single-helical proteins modeled within the tight-binding (TB) framework. We study the effects of helical symmetry, long-range hopping, environment and biological defects on thermal properties. We employ a general TB model to incorporate all parameters relevant to the helical structure of the protein. In order to provide additional insights into our results for the ESH, we also study the electronic density of states for various disorder strengths. We observe that the variation of the specific heat with disorder is very different in low and high temperature regimes, though the variation of ESH with temperature possesses a universal pattern upon varying disorder strengths related to environmental effects. Lastly, we propose an interesting application of the ESH spectra of proteins. We show that by studying the ESH of single-helical proteins, one can distinguish a defective sample from a pure one. This observation can serve as the basis of a screening technique that can be applied prior to a whole genome testing, thereby saving valuable time &amp; resources.</description>

      <title>New regime of the Coulomb blockade in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider how the absence of thermalisation affects the classical Coulomb blockade regime in quantum dots. By solving the quantum kinetic equation in the experimentally accessible regime when the dot has two relevant occupation states, we calculate the current-voltage characteristics for arbitrary coupling to the leads. If the couplings are strongly asymmetric, we have found that the Coulomb staircase practically reduces to the first step independent of the charging energy when the latter is larger than the Fermi energy, while the standard thermalised results are recovered in the opposite case. If the couplings are of the same order, the absence of thermalisation has a new, striking signature - a robust additional peak in the differential conductance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat and disorder are opponents of magnetism. This fact, expressed in Curie's law established more than a century ago, holds even in the highly non-equilibrium interaction of ultra-intense laser pulses with magnetic matter. In contradiction to this, here we demonstrate that optical excitation of a ferromagnet can abrogate the link between temperature and order and observe 100 femtosecond class laser pulses to drive a reduction in spin entropy, concomitant to an increase in spin polarization and magnetic moment persisting after relaxation back to local charge equilibrium. This both establishes disorder as an unexpected resource for magnetic control at ultrafast times and, by the provision of a purely electronic mechanism that does not involve reconfiguration of the crystal lattice, suggests a novel scheme for spin-based signal processing and information storage significantly faster than current methodology.</description>

      <title>Correlated magnetism of moir\'e exciton-polaritons on a triangular electron-spin lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate evidence of correlated magnetism for exciton-polaritons in a MoSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ moir\'e heterostructure with near-parallel alignment subject to electron doping. In our experiments, interactions between electrons and moir\'e excitons are controlled electrostatically by field-effect doping, and the polaritonic regime of strong light-matter coupling is established in an open cryogenic microcavity. Remarkably, at filling fractions around one electron per moir\'e cell, we observe drastic and nonlinear enhancement of the effective polariton Land\'e factor as a hallmark of correlated magnetism, which is cavity-controlled via resonance tuning of light and matter polariton constituents. Our work establishes moir\'e van der Waals heterostructures as an outstanding platform for studies of correlated phenomena in the presence of strong light-matter coupling and many-body phases of lattice-ordered excitons, charges and spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e systems featuring flat electronic bands exhibit a vast landscape of emergent exotic quantum states, making them one of the resourceful platforms in condensed matter physics in recent times. Tuning these systems via twist angle and the electric field greatly enhances our comprehension of their strongly correlated ground states. Here, we report a technique to investigate the nuanced intricacies of band structures in dual-gated multilayer graphene systems. We utilize the Landau levels of a decoupled monolayer graphene to extract the electric field-dependent bilayer graphene charge neutrality point gap. Then, we extend this method to analyze the evolution of the band gap and the flat bandwidth in twisted mono-bilayer graphene. The band gap maximizes at the same displacement field where the flat bandwidth minimizes, indicating the strongest electron-electron correlation, which is supported by directly observing the emergence of a strongly correlated phase. Moreover, we extract integer and fractional gaps to further demonstrate the strength of this method. Our technique gives a new perspective and paves the way for improving the understanding of electronic band structure in versatile flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Giant spatial anisotropy of magnon lifetime in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials with zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) but spin-split electronic bands (like ferromagnets) over a fraction of reciprocal space. As in antiferromagnets, magnons in altermagnets come in two flavours, that either add one or remove one unit of spin to the $S=0$ ground state. However, in altermagnets these two magnon modes are non-degenerate along some directions in reciprocal space. Here we show that the lifetime of altermagnetic magnons has a very strong dependence on both flavour and direction. Strikingly, coupling to Stoner modes leads to a complete suppression of magnon propagation along selected spatial directions. This giant anisotropy will impact electronic, spin, and energy transport properties and may be exploited in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of brightened dark excitons in a high-angle incommensurate Moir\'e homobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last few years have witnessed a surge in interest and research efforts in the field of twistronics, especially in low-angle twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalocogenides. These novel material platforms have been demonstrated to host periodic arrays of excitonic quantum emitters, interlayer excitons with long lifetimes, and exotic many-body states. While much remains to be known and understood about these heterostructures, the field of high-angle, incommensurate bilayers is even less explored. At twist angles larger than a few degrees, the presence of periodicity in these bilayers becomes chaotic, making the systems essentially aperiodic and incommensurate in nature due to the limitations of fabrication techniques. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of a brightened dark intralayer exciton in twisted molybdenum diselenide homobilayer. We show that this dark exciton diffuses across the excitation spot more efficiently as compared to trions or excitons, reaching diffusion lengths greater than 4 microns. Temperature-dependent spectra provide corroborative evidence and reveal a brightened dark trion. Our results reveal some of the richness of the physics of these high-angle systems.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED theory of direct and dual Shapiro steps with finite-size transmission line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of direct and dual Shapiro steps for a Josephson junction coupled to a finite-size transmission line resonator. We treat both problems through a circuit QED approach with a large, but finite number of photon modes. For the dual case, we do not assume the (approximate) charge-phase duality, but include the full multi-band dynamics for the Josephson junction. Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach reproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the number of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and thermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated Wigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the dual steps. We show how the dual steps are very sensitive to these fluctuations and identify the key physical parameters for the junction and the transmission line controlling their robustness, which is essential for applications to close the quantum metrological triangle.</description>

      <title>Ultraclean suspended graphene by radiolysis of adsorbed water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to intrinsic properties of a 2D material is challenging due to the absence of a bulk that would dominate over surface contamination, and this lack of bulk also precludes effective conventional cleaning methods that are almost always sacrificial. Suspended graphene and carbon contaminants represent the most salient challenge. This work has achieved ultraclean graphene, attested by electron energy loss (EEL) spectra unprecedentedly exhibiting fine-structure features expected from bonding and band structure. In the cleaning process in a transmission electron microscope, radicals generated by radiolysis of intentionally adsorbed water remove organic contaminants, which would otherwise be feedstock of the notorious electron irradiation induced carbon deposition. This method can be readily adapted to other experimental settings and other materials, to enable previously inhibited undertakings that rely on the intrinsic properties or ultimate thinness of 2D materials. Importantly, the method is surprisingly simple and robust, easily implementable with common lab equipment.</description>

Abstract: The strong coupling of plasmonic resonance modes in conductive pyramidal nanoparticles leads to an increase in the density of free charges on the surface. By ensuring plasmonic coupling in the pyramidal nanoparticle lattice, the achieved field intensity is potentiated. At the same time, a strong coupling between resonant modes is guaranteed, which results in the formation of new hybrid modes. In this manuscript, we demonstrated a tunable double anticrossing interaction that results from the interaction between two Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) modes and a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) wave. The tuning is done as a function of the variation of the angle of incidence of the input electric field. From the double anticrossing, an increase in field intensity in a blue-shifted LSPR mode located in the red wavelength region is observed. This demonstrates that at certain angles of incidence, the intensity field obtained is strongly favored, which would be beneficial for applications such as Surface Enhancement Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Nanoparticle-based lattices have been widely used for biosensor applications. However, one of the major limitations of this type of device is the low tolerance to high concentrations of biomolecules, which significantly affects their performance. According to the studies carried out for this manuscript, it was demonstrated that the implemented geometry allows for the observation of an LSPR mode, which is responsible for the control and synchronization of other perceived resonances. This mode remains almost invariant when subjected to structural variations or changes in the angle of incidence of the electric field. These characteristics eliminate the limitation mentioned above, allowing for sensitivities 10^3 times higher than those achieved in conventional systems based on LSPR used to detect P. brasiliensis antigen.</description>

Abstract: Kondo lattice systems are recognized for potentially hosting a variety of rich topological phases. Several pioneering studies have demonstrated significant anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects in these systems, attributed to the Berry curvature of the hybridization bands. In this study, we investigate UBiTe, a ferromagnetic Kondo lattice system. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity is closely tied to the Kondo coherence temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that slight shifts in the Fermi level across three different samples significantly influence this intrinsic contribution, in alignment with the Berry curvature localized within the narrow hybridization bands. This provides a stark contrast to the less pronounced sensitivity observed in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals, underscoring the distinctive electronic properties of Kondo lattice systems. The anomalous Hall conductivity of one samples ranks among the highest reported for topological magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: The notion of the flow introduced by Kitaev is a manifestly topological formulation of the winding number on a real lattice. First, we show in this paper that the flow is quite useful for practical numerical computations for systems without translational invariance. Second, we extend it to three dimensions. Namely, we derive a formula of the flow on a three-dimensional lattice, which corresponds to the conventional winding number when systems have translational invariance.</description>

      <title>On-demand heralded MIR single-photon source using a cascaded quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for generating single photons in the mid-Infrared (MIR) using a solid-state or molecular quantum emitter. The scheme utilises cavity QED effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a new quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.</description>

      <title>Engineering band structures of two-dimensional materials with remote moire ferroelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stacking order and twist angle provide abundant opportunities for engineering band structures of two-dimensional materials, including the formation of moire bands, flat bands, and topologically nontrivial bands. The inversion symmetry breaking in rhombohedral-stacked transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) endows them with an interfacial ferroelectricity associated with an out-of-plane electric polarization. By utilizing twist angle as a knob to construct rhombohedral-stacked TMDCs, antiferroelectric domain networks with alternating out-of-plane polarization can be generated. Here, we demonstrate that such spatially periodic ferroelectric polarizations in parallel-stacked twisted WSe2 can imprint their moire potential onto a remote bilayer graphene. This remote moire potential gives rise to pronounced satellite resistance peaks besides the charge-neutrality point in graphene, which are tunable by the twist angle of WSe2. Our observations of ferroelectric hysteresis at finite displacement fields suggest the moire is delivered by a long-range electrostatic potential. The constructed superlattices by moire ferroelectricity represent a highly flexible approach, as they involve the separation of the moire construction layer from the electronic transport layer. This remote moire is identified as a weak potential and can coexist with conventional moire. Our results offer a comprehensive strategy for engineering band structures and properties of two-dimensional materials by utilizing moire ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Ubiquity of the spin-orbit induced magnon nonreciprocity in ultrathin ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of magnons along a symmetry path may depend on the direction of propagation, similar to many other quasiparticles in nature. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as nonreciprocity. In addition to the fact that it is of great interest to understand the fundamental physical mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal propagation, the phenomenon of magnon nonreciprocity may be used to design magnon-based logic devices. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a significantly large spin-orbit coupling can lead to giant nonreciprocity of exchange-dominated terahertz magnons, when they are excited by means of spin-polarized electrons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126702 (2024)]. Here, by providing experimental results on two additional systems we demonstrate the generality of the observed phenomenon. Comparing the results of a Co/Ni bilayer on Ir(001) to those of a Co double layer on Ir(001) and W(110) we unravel the impact of the interfacial electronic hybridization on the observed phenomenon and provide further insights into the microscopic mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal magnon excitation. It was observed that the interfacial electronic hybridization, which is governing the magnetic properties of the interface atomic layer, is somewhat important but is not crucial for the magnon nonreciprocity. On the other hand the choice of the incident energy of the incoming electron beam is decisive for the observation of the effect. Our results indicate that depending on the energy of the incident electron beam and the scattering geometry the magnon nonreciprocity can be tuned and even be inverted for some ranges of the magnon momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency $1/f^\alpha$ charge noise significantly hinders the performance of voltage-controlled spin qubits in quantum dots. Here, we utilize fractional calculus to design voltage control pulses yielding the highest average fidelities for noisy quantum gate operations. We focus specifically on the exponential voltage control of the exchange interaction generating two-spin $\mathrm{SWAP}^k$ gates. When stationary charge noise is the dominant source of gate infidelity, we derive that the optimal exchange pulse is long and weak, with the broad shape of the symmetric beta distribution function with parameter $1-\alpha/2$. The common practice of making exchange pulses fast and high-amplitude still remains beneficial in the case of strongly nonstationary noise dynamics, modeled as fractional Brownian motion. The proposed methods are applicable to the characterization and optimization of quantum gate operations in various voltage-controlled qubit architectures.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators are described by topological invariants that can be computed by integrals over momentum space, but also as traces over local, real-space topological markers. These markers are useful to detect topological insulating phases in disordered crystals, quasicrystals and amorphous systems. Among these markers, only the spectral localizer operator can be used to distinguish topological metals, that show zero-modes of the localizer spectrum. However, it remains unclear whether trivial metals also display zero-modes, and if their localizer spectrum is distinguishable from topological ones. Here, we show that trivial metals generically display zero-modes of the localizer spectrum. The localizer zero-modes are determined by the zero-mode solutions of a Dirac equation with a varying mass parameter. We use this observation, valid in any dimension, to determine the difference between the localizer spectrum of trivial and topological metals, and conjecture the spectrum of the localizer for fractional quantum Hall edges. Because the localizer is a local, real-space operator, it may be used as a tool to differentiate between non-crystalline topological and trivial metals, and characterize strongly correlated systems, for which local topological markers are scarce.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have recently been established experimentally as a highly-tunable condensed matter platform, facilitating the controlled manipulation of band structures and interactions. In several of these materials, Dirac cones are present in the low-energy regime near the Fermi level. Thus, fermionic excitations emerging in these materials close to the Dirac cones have a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi surface as massless relativistic Dirac fermions. Here, we study low-energy fermionic excitations of such Dirac materials in the presence of a mass gap that may be generated by symmetry breaking. Introducing a dynamical Fermi velocity and/or time-dependent mass gap for the Dirac quasiparticles, we exhibit the emergence of an analog of cosmological fermion pair production in terms of observables such as the expected occupation number or two-point correlation functions. We find that it is necessary and sufficient for quasiparticle production that only the ratio between the mass gap and the Fermi velocity is time-dependent. In this way, we establish that highly-tunable Dirac materials can serve as analog models for cosmological spacetime geometries, in particular, for Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker expanding cosmologies. We briefly discuss possibilities for experimental realization</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is central to band topology in condensed matter physics, which allows us to understand and design distinct topological states. In this work, we find another mechanism to analogize the SSH model in a spinful system, realizing an obstructed atomic insulator by introducing intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman field. In our model, the midgap states originate from a quantized hidden polarization with invariant index $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) due to the local inversion symmetry breaking. When the global inversion symmetry is broken, a charge pumping is designed by tuning the polarization. Moreover, by introducing the $p+ip$ superconductor pairing potential, a new topological phase dubbed obstructed superconductor (OSC) is identified. This new state is characterized by invariant index $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) and nonchiral midgap states. More interestingly, these nonchiral edge states result in a chiral-like nonlocal conductance, which is different from the traditional chiral topological superconductor. Our findings not only find another strategy to achieve a spinful SSH model but also predict the existence of OSC, providing a promising avenue for further exploration of its transport properties.</description>

Abstract: We study the spatiotemporal dynamics of ultrafast electron spin transport across nanometer-thick copper layers using broadband terahertz spectroscopy. Our analysis of temporal delays, broadening and attenuation of the spin-current pulse revealed ballistic-like propagation of the pulse peak, approaching the Fermi velocity, and diffusive features including a significant velocity dispersion. A comparison to the frequency-dependent Ficks law identified the diffusion-dominated transport regime for distances larger than 2 nm. The findings lie the groundwork for designing future broadband spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Studying magnon band topology through low-energy magnon excitations: role of anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study topological properties of magnons via creating spin excitations in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets on a two-dimensional square lattice. It is known that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays an important role in coupling between different particle (spin excitation) sectors, here we consider an anisotropic DMI and ascertain the role of the anisotropy parameter in inducing topological phase transitions. We have extended the formalism for studying magnon band topology for the antiferromagnetic case, which facilitates a comparison between the two magnetically ordered systems. Owing to the presence of a two-sublattice structure of an antiferromagnet, a larger number of bands participate in unraveling the topological properties. However, in both the cases, an extended trivial region is observed even with the DMI to be non-zero, which is surprising since the DMI is the origin of finite Berry curvature due to the violation of effective time reversal symmetry. Furthermore, in an antiferromagnet, a smaller anisotropy is capable of inducing a gap-closing transition from a topological to a trivial phase compared to that for a ferromagnet. The nature of the phases in both the cases and the phase transitions therein are characterized by the band structure, presence (or absence) of the chiral edge modes, computation of the thermal Hall effect, etc. Moreover, an external magnetic field is found to play a decisive role in controlling the critical point that demarcates various topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In parallel with advances in microscale imaging techniques, the fields of biology and materials science have focused on precisely extracting particle properties based on their diffusion behavior. Although the majority of real-world particles exhibit anisotropy, their behavior has been studied less than that of isotropic particles. In this study, we introduce a new method for estimating the diffusion coefficients of individual anisotropic particles using short-trajectory data on the basis of a maximum likelihood framework. Traditional estimation techniques often use mean-squared displacement (MSD) values or other statistical measures that inherently remove angular information. Instead, we treated the angle as a latent variable and used belief propagation to estimate it while maximizing the likelihood using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared to conventional methods, this approach facilitates better estimation of shorter trajectories and faster rotations, as confirmed by numerical simulations and experimental data involving bacteria and quantum rods. Additionally, we performed an analytical investigation of the limits of detectability of anisotropy and provided guidelines for the experimental design. In addition to serving as a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems, the proposed method will pave the way for applying maximum likelihood methods to more complex diffusion phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the directionality effects in spontaneous emission and resonance fluorescence of a quantum two-level dipole emitter near an ultrathin closely packed periodically aligned single-wall carbon nanotube film. Such films present an example of highly anisotropic flexible metasurfaces that are now available experimentally. The nanotube alignment is shown to provide an extra measure for quantum control of dipolar spontaneous emission and resonance fluorescence in such systems, in addition to film thickness and composition parameters such as tube diameter, chirality and translational period. The processes studied are shown to be highly anisotropic, being enhanced by orders of magnitude in the direction perpendicular to the alignment and metasurface plane, contrasting with the commonly believed viewpoint of their uncontrollably random directionality.</description>

Abstract: Silicon-based color-centers (SiCCs) have recently emerged as quantum-light sources that can be combined with telecom-range Si Photonics platforms. Unfortunately, using current SiCC fabrication, deterministic control over the vertical emitter position is impossible due to ion-implantation's stochastic nature. To overcome this bottleneck towards high-yield integration, we demonstrate a radically innovative creation method for various SiCCs, solely relying on epitaxial growth of Si and C-doped Si at atypically-low temperatures in a ultra-clean growth environment. These telecom emitters can be confined within sub-1nm thick layers embedded at arbitrary vertical positions within a highly crystalline Si matrix. Tuning growth conditions and doping, different SiCC types, e.g., W-centers, T-centers, G-centers, or derivatives like G'-centers can be created, which are particularly promising as Si-based single-photon sources and spin-photon interfaces. The zero-phonon emission from G'-centers can be conveniently tuned by the C-concentration, leading to a systematic wavelength shift and linewidth narrowing towards low emitter densities.</description>

      <title>Josephson Diode Effect in Topological Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in topological Josephson junctions. By both analytic and numerical calculations, we find that while a Josephson junction in the topological phase may exhibit higher diode efficiency compared to that in the trivial phase, this behavior is not universal. The presence of Majorana bound states is not a sufficient condition for a large diode effect. Furthermore, the diode efficiency undergoes substantial changes only in specific regions along the topological phase transition boundary, and a significant diode effect does coincide with the topological phases. Thereby our paper suggests the utilization of topological superconductivity for enhanced JDE, and also the Josephson diode effect may serve as an indicator for topological superconductor phase. These results suggest a nuanced relationship between the topological aspects of Josephson junctions and Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Maximizing bipolar sensitivity for anomalous Nernst thermopiles in heat flux sensing in amorphous GdCo alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Heat Flux Sensor (HFS) facilitates the visualization of heat flow, unlike a temperature sensor, and is anticipated to be a key technology in managing waste heat. Recently, an HFS utilizing the Anomalous Nernst Effect (ANE) has been proposed garnering significant interest in enhancing the transverse Seebeck coefficient. However, ideal materials for HFS not only require a large transverse Seebeck coefficient but also meet several criteria including low thermal conductivity and a bipolar nature of the transverse Seebeck coefficient, especially a negative coefficient. In this study, we have investigated ANE in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo alloys, revealing their numerous advantages as HFS materials. These include a large transverse Seebeck coefficient, extremely low thermal conductivity, large negative sensitivity, unparalleled bipolar sensitivity, versatility for deposition on various substrates, and a small longitudinal Seebeck coefficient. These qualities position GdCo films as promising candidates for the advancement of HFS technology.</description>

      <title>A lattice formulation of Weyl fermions on a single curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard lattice domain-wall fermion formulation, one needs two flat domain-walls where both of the left- and right-handed massless modes appear. In this work we investigate a single domain-wall system with a nontrivial curved background. Specifically we consider a massive fermion on a $3D$ square lattice, whose domain-wall is a $2D$ sphere. In the free theory, we find that a single Weyl fermion is localized at the wall and it feels gravity through the induced spin connection. With a topologically nontrivial $U(1)$ link gauge field, however, we find a zero mode with the opposite chirality localized at the center where the gauge field is singular. In the latter case, the low-energy effective theory is not chiral but vectorlike. We discuss how to circumvent this obstacle in formulating lattice chiral gauge theory in the single domain-wall fermion system.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory of giant phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac semimetals. Our theory is based on an emergent gauge field approach to the electron-phonon coupling, applicable to both gapless and gapped systems. We find that the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the electrical Hall conductivity through the phonon Hall viscosity. Our theory is combined with the first-principles calculations, allowing us to quantitatively implement it to realistic materials. Magnetic moments are found to be on the order of Bohr magneton for certain phonon modes in graphene and $\text{Cd}_3 \text{As}_2$. Our results provide practical guidance for the dynamical generation of large magnetization in the topological quantum materials.</description>
