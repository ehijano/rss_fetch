      <title>Impact of Forest Canopy Structure on Buoyant Plume Dynamics During Wildland Fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of forest canopy heterogeneity on buoyant plume dynamics resulting from surface thermal anomalies representing wildland fires, utilizing Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The Parallelized Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM) was employed to simulate six canopy configurations: no canopy, homogeneous canopy, external plume-edge canopy, internal plume-edge canopy, 100 m gap canopy, and 200 m gap canopy. Each configuration was analyzed with and without a static surface heat flux patch of 5000 $\mathrm{W \cdot m^{-2}}$, resulting in a resting buoyant plume. Simulations were conducted under three crosswind speeds: 0, 5, and 10 $\mathrm{m \cdot s^{-1}}$. Results show that canopy structure significantly modifies plume behavior, mean flow, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets. Plume updraft speed and tilt varied with canopy configuration and crosswind speed. Pressure gradients associated with plume updrafts were modified based on the canopy configuration, resulting in varying crosswind speed reductions at the plume region. Strong momentum absorption was observed above the canopy for the crosswind cases, with the greatest enhancement in the gap canopies. Momentum injection from below the canopy due to the heat source was also observed, resulting in plume structure modulation based on canopy configuration. TKE was found to be the largest in the gap canopy configurations. TKE budget analysis revealed that buoyant production dominated over shear production. At the center of the heat patch, the gap canopy configurations showed enhanced buoyancy within the gap. Spatial distributions demonstrated increased shear production at the interface between the plume and crosswind.</description>

      <title>Confronting Contemporary Seasonality Changes in East Asian Tropical Cyclone Landfalls with a Multi-Century Historical Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paleoclimate records provide a critical long-term perspective on natural climate variability, essential for understanding contemporary climate change. However, existing paleoclimate proxies lack the spatial-temporal coverage for studying changes in high-impact weather extremes like tropical cyclones (TCs). Here we introduce a multi-source framework that confronts the contemporary changes in TC landfalls in East Asia with a multi-century baseline (1368-1911) reconstructed from historical documents. Leveraging pre-industrial and contemporary data, the analysis reveals that a relatively small shift toward earlier landfalls in the contemporary era (1946-2020). However, this shift falls well within the range of natural fluctuations documented historically (1651-1900). This low signal-to-noise ratio indicates the forced anthropogenic signal of TC landfall timing remains challenging to detect. Besides providing a template for assessing seasonality changes in extremes, our work shows consistent natural controls of TC timing in contemporary and pre-industrial eras, lending credibility to pre-industrial observational datasets and climate simulations.</description>
