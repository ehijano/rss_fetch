      <title>Fast Symbolic Integer-Linear Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we contribute a fast symbolic eigenvalue solver for matrices whose eigenvalues are $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of their entries, alongside efficient general and stochastic $M^{X}$ generators. Users can interact with a few degrees of freedom to create linear operators, making high-dimensional symbolic analysis feasible for when numerical analyses are insufficient.</description>

      <title>Multigrid methods for the Stokes problem on GPU systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a matrix-free multigrid method for solving the Stokes problem, discretized using $H^{\text{div}}$-conforming discontinuous Galerkin methods. We employ a Schur complement method combined with the fast diagonalization method for the efficient evaluation of the local solver within the multiplicative Schwarz smoother. This approach operates directly on both the velocity and pressure spaces, eliminating the need for a global Schur complement approximation. By leveraging the tensor product structure of Raviart-Thomas elements and an optimized, conflict-free shared memory access pattern, the matrix-free operator evaluation demonstrates excellent performance numbers, reaching over one billion degrees of freedom per second on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Numerical results indicate efficiency comparable to that of the three-dimensional Poisson problem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive finite element methods based on flux and stress equilibration using FEniCSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution shows how a-posteriori error estimators based on equilibrated fluxes - H(div) functions fulfilling the underlying conservation law - can be implemented in FEniCSx. Therefore, dolfinx_eqlb is introduced, its algorithmic structure is described and classical benchmarks for adaptive solution procedures for the Poisson problem and linear elasticity are presented.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Model Based Iterative Reconstruction of Symmetric Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction of objects with cylindrical symmetry can be performed with a single projection. When the measured rays are parallel, and the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the optical axis, the data can be modeled with the so-called Abel Transform. The Abel Transform has been extensively studied and many methods exist for accurate reconstruction. However, most CT geometries are cone-beam rather than parallel-beam. Using Abel methods for reconstruction in these cases can lead to distortions and reconstruction artifacts. Here, we develop analytic and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) methods to reconstruct symmetric objects with an arbitrary axis of symmetry from a cone-beam geometry. The MBIR methods demonstrate superior results relative to the analytic inversion methods by mitigating artifacts and reducing noise while retaining fine image features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods using simulated and experimentally-acquired x-ray and neutron projections.</description>

      <title>CDOpt: A Python Package for a Class of Riemannian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization over the embedded submanifold defined by constraints $c(x) = 0$ has attracted much interest over the past few decades due to its wide applications in various areas. Plenty of related optimization packages have been developed based on Riemannian optimization approaches, which rely on some basic geometrical materials of Riemannian manifolds, including retractions, vector transports, etc. These geometrical materials can be challenging to determine in general. Existing packages only accommodate a few well-known manifolds whose geometrical materials are easily accessible. For other manifolds which are not contained in these packages, the users have to develop the geometric materials by themselves. In addition, it is not always tractable to adopt advanced features from various state-of-the-art unconstrained optimization solvers to Riemannian optimization approaches.
  We introduce CDOpt (available at https://cdopt.github.io/), a user-friendly Python package for a class Riemannian optimization. Based on constraint dissolving approaches, Riemannian optimization problems are transformed into their equivalent unconstrained counterparts in CDOpt. Therefore, solving Riemannian optimization problems through CDOpt directly benefits from various existing solvers and the rich expertise gained over decades for unconstrained optimization. Moreover, all the computations in CDOpt related to any manifold in question are conducted on its constraints expression, hence users can easily define new manifolds in CDOpt without any background on differential geometry. Furthermore, CDOpt extends the neural layers from PyTorch and Flax, thus allows users to train manifold constrained neural networks directly by the solvers for unconstrained optimization. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that CDOpt is highly efficient and robust in solving various classes of Riemannian optimization problems.</description>
