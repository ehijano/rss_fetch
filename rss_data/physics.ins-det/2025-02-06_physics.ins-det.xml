      <title>Automated split Hopkinson pressure bar for high throughput dynamic experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing novel materials for impact applications and predicting material behavior using data-driven techniques require extensive datasets, which can be challenging to obtain through conventional experimental methods. While high throughput characterization is feasible at the sample micro and nanoscale, there remains a critical need for an experimental tool capable of facilitating high-throughput measurements at the macroscale. This paper presents the design and development of a fully automated split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) with full-field diagnostics for performing dynamic compression experiments on different materials. The automated SHPB experiments consist of four main components: 1) striker launch and retrieval system, 2) bar repositioning mechanism, 3) automated sample placement system, and 4) diagnostics. Each of these systems employs various electromechanical devices and actuators programmed to work collaboratively to automate the SHPB experimental setup. A data analysis tool has been developed to automate the post-processing of the data obtained from the setup. The setup also incorporates automated high-speed imaging, enabling full-field strain measurement capabilities. To benchmark the setup, fully automated dynamic compression experiments were conducted on 45 Copper 101 samples and 20 3D-printed resin samples. The stress-strain curve was extracted from the raw data using the automated data analysis tool. The efficiency of the data analysis tool is validated by comparing the data with existing data analysis tools for SHPB. The stress-strain response obtained from the copper experiments aligned well with existing data on copper. Furthermore, the full-field strain measurements in experiments show strain values comparable to those of the strain gauge measurements. This advancement has enabled dynamic compression experiments on materials at a rate of 60 samples per hour.</description>

      <title>Exploration of optimized front-end readout circuit for time measurement of large-area SiPM arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detector of TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT) will use large-area silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays combined with photomultiplier tubes to boost photon detection efficiency and pointing capability. An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is being developed to aim at high-resolution time measurement of large-area SiPM arrays. This work researches four architectures of readout circuits including different input stages (common gate stage and negative feedback common gate stage) and discriminators (two types of current discriminator and one voltage discriminator) using a 180 nm CMOS process for optimizing time resolution. The experimental measurements show that single photon time resolutions performed using Hamamatsu S13360-3050PE SiPMs are around 260 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM). A timing jitter less than 500 ps FWHM when connecting a 6x6 mm^2 SiPM array is achieved. The power consumption is less than 7 mW/channel. Additionally, a digital summation is applied to reduce the number of output interfaces. The measured performances of the ASIC cater to the TRIDENT application requirements.</description>

      <title>LUCAS: A CMOS-Based Fast Readout ASIC for Silicon Photomultipliers -- Measurement and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of LUCAS, a low-power, ultra-low jitter ASIC optimized for SiPM readout in Time-of-Flight Computed Tomography (ToF-CT) applications. Leveraging a novel preamplifier design with low input impedance and current-mode operation, LUCAS addresses challenges such as parasitic capacitance of SiPMs and high-speed detection requirements. The ASIC, fabricated in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology, features eight channels with an integrated preamplifier and comparator, achieving an SPTR of 201 ps FWHM at 3.2 mW/ch. Experimental validation includes input impedance measurements, SPTR testing with a pulsed laser source, and energy-to-Time-over-Threshold calibration using monoenergetic X-ray sources. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LUCAS in enhancing timing resolution while minimizing power consumption, offering significant advancements for high-resolution ToF-CT imaging.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian perspective on single-shot laser characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian framework for measuring spatio-temporal couplings (STCs) in ultra-intense lasers that reconceptualizes what constitutes a 'single-shot' measurement. Moving beyond traditional distinctions between single- and multi-shot devices, our approach provides rigorous criteria for determining when measurements can truly resolve individual laser shots rather than statistical averages. This framework shows that single-shot capability is not an intrinsic device property but emerges from the relationship between measurement precision and inherent parameter variability. Implementing this approach with a new measurement device at the ATLAS-3000 petawatt laser, we provide the first quantitative uncertainty bounds on pulse front tilt and curvature. Notably, we observe that our Bayesian method reduces uncertainty by up to 60% compared to traditional approaches. Through this analysis, we reveal how the interplay between measurement precision and intrinsic system variability defines achievable resolution -- insights that have direct implications for applications where precise control of laser-matter interaction is critical.</description>

      <title>Application of Flex-QA Arrays in HTS Magnet Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible PCB quench antennas have been very useful in providing high-quality high-resolution data in low temperature superconducting magnet tests. Similar multi-sensor arrays have been employed recently to cover a high temperature superconductor magnet tested at FNAL. In the present work, data taking conditions and magnet features to support the analysis framework are discussed. Then observations made during complete magnet powering cycles are described and analysis of quench antenna data are presented. Based on results, improvements to instrumentation and data taking are debated. Views on the future of flexible quench antenna sensors for HTS magnet diagnostics and operational support are shared.</description>

      <title>HEP High Power Targetry Roadmap -- Workshop Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a reliable target is already a challenge for MW-class facilities today and has led several major accelerator facilities to operate at lower than design power due to target concerns. With present plans to increase beam power for next generation accelerator facilities in the next decade, timely R and D in support of robust high power targets is critical to secure the full physics benefits of ambitious accelerator power upgrades. A comprehensive R and D program must be implemented to address the many complex challenges faced by multi MW beam intercepting devices. This roadmap is envisioned to be helpful to the DOE-OHEP office when planning and prioritizing future R and D activities as well as leveraging synergies across the Office of Science. The roadmap will be extremely beneficial to the broader (external to DOE HEP) HPT community by communicating OHEP s high level strategy and objectives for HPT R and D and highlighting possible opportunities for collaboration.</description>

      <title>A new method for structural diagnostics with muon tomography and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of the muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of the reconstruction of 1 cm--thick iron tubes inside 30 cm--deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results into a dramatic improvement of the image quality, as well as into a significant reduction of the data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges, $e$, controlled with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-8}$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never demonstrated such an accuracy for a net flow. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty in the milliampere range, but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections. Here, we present a new programmable quantum current generator, which combines both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier in a quantum electrical circuit enabling the current scaling without errors. Thanks to a full quantum instrumentation, we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated currents, in the microampere range, at quantized values, $\pm(n/p)ef_\mathrm{J}$, with relative uncertainties less than $10^{-8}$, where $n$ and $p$ are integer control parameters and $f_\mathrm{J}$ is the Josephson frequency. This experiment sets the basis of a universal quantum realization of the electrical units, for example able of improving high-value resistance measurements and bridging the gap with other quantum current sources.</description>

      <title>Zero- to Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR modality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin interactions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman interactions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength or below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement of spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive means for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting sample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong external magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up new capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to the preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging. Furthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio band, the nuclear spins can be manipulated with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and highly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to high-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive materials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not lead to resonance line broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable practical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative simplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR has become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity and their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization methods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders of magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future avenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.</description>

      <title>Imaging simulation of a dual-panel PET geometry with ultrafast TOF detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), time-of-flight (TOF) information localizes source positions along lines of response. Cherenkov-radiator-integrated microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes have achieved 30 ps TOF resolution, demonstrating cross-sectional imaging without reconstruction. Such ultrafast TOF detectors would free PET from conventional ring geometries. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating imaging characteristics of a dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors using Geant4 simulation. Two detector panels ($142 \times 142~mm^2$), which consisted of 5.0 mm-thick bismuth germanate pixelized crystals with a 5.75 mm pitch, were placed face-to-face at a 300 mm distance. Spatial resolution and image noise with various TOF resolutions from 30 to 90 ps were evaluated. Because degraded efficiency may cancel TOF gain in image quality, detection efficiency was also parameterized by reducing coincidence counts. A numerical phantom, which consisted of multi-rod and uniform cylindrical activities (21 MBq in total), was simulated for 600 s. Regarding image reconstruction, results of a backprojection (i.e., no reconstruction) were compared with those of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM). The dual-panel PET required a 40 ps TOF resolution to have a similar spatial resolution to that of a non-TOF ring PET (300 mm in diameter) for the same detection efficiency. The TOF resolution should be 30 ps with half the efficiency to maintain a similar image noise to that of the 40 ps TOF with complete efficiency. MLEM provided better imaging performance than backprojection, even at 30 ps TOF. The feasibility of the proposed dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors was shown.</description>
