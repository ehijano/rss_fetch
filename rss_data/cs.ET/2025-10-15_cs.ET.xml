      <title>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Human-in-the-Loop for Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing hardware enables edge computing and can be implemented in flexible electronics for novel applications. Metal oxide materials are promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible. Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow, demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensing of Temperature, Strain and Crack Growth in 3D-Printed Metal Structures via Magnetoelastic and Thermomagnetic Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the first realization of wireless strain and temperature sensing within 3D-printed metallic structures using standard electromagnetic inspection hardware. This establishes a path toward need-based parts maintenance driven by accurate damage assessments instead of relying on regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns, extending the service intervals of structures operating in harsh environments. To this end, we encapsulate magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials inside microtubes and embed the sensing elements during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the impedance of a coil placed on or near the surface of the printed part. We demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 over at least a 6x10-4 strain range, and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75oC over a 70oC range, both to a 95% confidence interval. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of cycles before critical failure. This extends non-destructive eddy-current damage detection to accurate, real-time strain and temperature monitoring within metallic structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Staff Scheduling in Educational Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a novel staff allocation problem that arises in the organization of collaborators among multiple school sites and educational levels. The problem emerges from a real case study in a public school in Calabria, Italy, where staff members must be distributed across kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools under constraints of availability, competencies, and fairness. To tackle this problem, we develop an optimization model and investigate a solution approach based on quantum annealing. Our computational experiments on real-world data show that quantum annealing is capable of producing balanced assignments in short runtimes. These results provide evidence of the practical applicability of quantum optimization methods in educational scheduling and, more broadly, in complex resource allocation tasks.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Inverse Gaussians for Hemodynamic Transport (MIGHT) in Vascular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (MC) in the cardiovascular system (CVS) is a key enabler for many envisioned medical applications in the human body, such as targeted drug delivery, early cancer detection, and continuous health monitoring. The design of MC systems for such applications requires suitable models for the signaling molecule propagation through complex vessel networks (VNs). Existing theoretical models offer limited analytical tractability and lack closed-form solutions, making the analysis of large-scale VNs either infeasible or not insightful. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel closed-form physical model, termed MIGHT, for advection-diffusion-driven transport of signaling molecules through complex VNs. The model represents the received molecule flux as a weighted sum of inverse Gaussian (IG) distributions, parameterized by physical properties of the network. The proposed model is validated by comparison with an existing convolution-based model and finite-element simulations. Further, we show that the model can be applied for the reduction of large VNs to simplified representations preserving the essential transport dynamics and for estimating representative VN based on received signals from unknown VNs.</description>

      <title>Translating Milli/Microrobots with A Value-Centered Readiness Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration. Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility, and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new, safer and more efficient interventions.</description>

      <title>High-Parallel FPGA-Based Discrete Simulated Bifurcation for Large-Scale Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity, making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut and knapsack problems.</description>

      <title>ECMSim: A high-performance web simulation of cardiac ECM remodeling through integrated ODE-based signaling and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Generative Framework for Modeling Single-Cell Transcriptomes with Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies and the simultaneous gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel hybrid quantum-classical simulator that leverages quantum entanglement to model single-cell transcriptomes. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) and cell-cell communication topologies with explicit directionality (causality). The synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies that challenge standard analysis. We demonstrated that classical correlation methods (Pearson and Spearman) failed to reconstruct the complete programmed quantum causal paths, instead reporting spurious statistical artifacts driven by high base-gene expression probabilities. Applying CellChat2.0 to the simulated cell-cell communication validated the true mechanistic links by showing a robust, relative increase in communication probability (up to 75-fold) only when the quantum entanglement was active. This work confirms that the quantum kernel is essential for creating high-fidelity ground truth data, highlighting the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient QUBO Formulation for Constrained Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8 and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising paradigm that may overcome the current computational power bottlenecks. The increasing maturity of quantum processors provides more possibilities for the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. As the crucial stages for quantum algorithm implementation, the logic circuit design and quantum compiling have also received significant attention, which covers key technologies, e.g., quantum logic circuit synthesis (also widely known as quantum architecture search) and optimization, as well as qubit mapping and routing. Recent studies suggest that the scale and precision of related algorithms are steadily increasing, especially with the integration of artificial intelligence methods. In this survey, we systematically review and summarize a vast body of literature, exploring the feasibility of an integrated design and optimization scheme that spans from the algorithmic level to quantum hardware, combining the steps of logic circuit design and compilation optimization. Leveraging the exceptional cognitive and learning capabilities of AI algorithms, it becomes more possible to reduce manual design costs, enhance the precision and efficiency of execution, and facilitate the implementation and validation of the superiority of quantum algorithms on hardware.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Autonomous LLM Agents for Explainable Power Electronics Modulation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based autonomous agents have recently shown strong capabilities in solving complex industrial design tasks. However, in domains aiming for carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability, scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface. This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs. The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over 33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.</description>
