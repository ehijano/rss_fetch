      <title>Integrable self-adaptive moving mesh schemes for multi-component short pulse type equations under general boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct integrable self-adaptive moving mesh schemes for multi-component modified short pulse and short pulse equations under general boundary conditions including periodic boundary conditions by using the consistency condition with the hodograph transformation. We also construct multi-soliton solutions expressed by Pfaffian for our self-adaptive moving mesh schemes. Using self-adaptive moving mesh schemes presented in this paper, we perform numerical experiments to evaluate their effectiveness and accuracy as a numerical method.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative discrete equations, symmetries and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the Lax pairs of the noncommutative discrete potential Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) and Hirota's KdV equations, we derive differential--difference equations that are consistent with these systems and serve as their generalised symmetries. Miura transformations mapping these equations to a noncommutative modified Volterra equation and its master symmetry are constructed. We demonstrate the use of these symmetries to reduce the potential KdV equation, leading to a noncommutative discrete Painlev{\`{e}} equation and to a system of partial differential equations that generalises the Ernst equation and the Neugebauer--Kramer involution. Additionally, we present a Darboux transformation and an auto-B\"acklund transformation for the Hirota KdV equation, and establish their connection with the noncommutative Yang--Baxter map $F_{III}$.</description>

      <title>An infinite family of Dunkl type superintegrable curved Hamiltonians through coalgebra symmetry: Oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between Dunkl superintegrable systems and the coalgebra symmetry approach to superintegrability, and subsequently to recover known models and construct new ones. In particular, an infinite family of $N$-dimensional quasi-maximally superintegrable quantum systems with reflections, sharing the same set of $2N-3$ quantum integrals, is introduced. The result is achieved by introducing a novel differential-difference realization of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ and then applying the coalgebra formalism. Several well-known maximally superintegrable models with reflections appear as particular cases of this general family, among them, the celebrated Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system. Furthermore, restricting to the case of "hidden" quantum quadratic symmetries, maximally superintegrable curved oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians of Dunkl type, sharing the same underlying $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ coalgebra symmetry, are presented. Namely, the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on the $N$-sphere and hyperbolic space together with two models which can be interpreted as a one-parameter superintegrable deformation of the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on non-constant curvature spaces. In addition, maximally superintegrable generalizations of these models, involving non-central potentials, are also derived on flat and curved spaces. For all specific systems, at least an additional quantum integral is explicitly provided, which is related to the Dunkl version of a (curved) Demkov-Fradkin tensor or a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with local and nonlocal nonlinearities under non-zero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, the theory of inverse scattering transform is established for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with local and nonlocal nonlinearities (which originates from the parity-symmetric reduction of the Manakov system) under non-zero boundary conditions. First, the adjoint Lax pair and auxiliary eigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering, and the analyticity, symmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail. Then, the distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed rigorously. Compared with the Manakov system, the reverse-space nonlocality introduces an additional symmetry, leading to stricter constraints on eigenfunctions, scattering coefficients and norming constants. Further, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the the inverse problem with the scattering coefficients admitting an arbitrary number of simple zeros. For the reflectionless case, the N-soliton solutions are presented in the determinant form. With N=1, the dark and beating one-soliton solutions are obtained, which are respectively associated with a pair of discrete eigenvalues lying on and off the circle on the spectrum plane. Via the asymptotic analysis, the two-soliton solutions are found to admit the interactions between two dark solitons or two beating solitons, as well as the superpositions of two beating solitons or one beating soliton and one dark soliton.</description>

      <title>Thoughts about potentials with finite-band spectrum and finite-dimensional reductions of integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We repeat, using methods developed for BKM systems, the famous results of S. Novikov (1974), J. Moser (1981, 1982) , and A. Veselov (1980) that relate Schr\"odinger-Hill operators with finite-band spectra, solutions of the Neumann system, and certain solutions of the KdV equations. Our general motivation is to determine whether it is possible to apply inverse scattering methods to BKM systems, and in the conclusion, we indicate initial observations in this direction.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for operator fields in small dimensions and Tempesta-Tondo conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for an operator field in small dimensions. In dimensions three and four, we find tensorial conditions for an operator field $L$, similar to a nilpotent Jordan block, to possess local coordinates in which $L$ takes a strictly upper triangular form. We prove the Tempesta-Tondo conjecture for higher order brackets of Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis type.</description>

      <title>Self-duality and the Holomorphic Ansatz in Generalized BPS Skyrme Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the BPS Skyrme model for simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. In such a theory, the Skyrme field takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. We also use the holomorphic map ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow G/H \times U(1)$ to study the self-dual sector of the theory, which generalizes the holomorphic ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow CP^N$. This ansatz is constructed using the fact that stable harmonic maps of the two $S^2$ spheres for compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. Apart from some special cases, the self-duality equations do not fix the matrix $h$ entirely in terms of the Skyrme field, which is completely free, as it happens in the original self-dual Skyrme model for $G=SU(2)$. In general, the freedom of the $h$ fields tend to grow with the dimension of $G$. The holomorphic ansatz enable us to construct an infinite number of exact self-dual Skyrmions for each integer value of the topological charge and for each value of $N \geq 1$, in case of the $CP^N$, and for each values of $p,\,q\geq 1$ in case of $SU(p+q)/SU(p)\otimes SU(q)\otimes U(1)$.</description>

      <title>Poncelet porism in singular cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Poncelet porism is usually studied for a pair of smooth conics that are in a general position. Here we discuss Poncelet porism in the real plane - affine or projective, when that is not the case, i.e. the conics have at least one point of tangency or at least one of the conics is not smooth. In all such cases, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an n-gon inscribed in one of the conics and circumscribed about the other.</description>

      <title>Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that deepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.</description>
