      <title>Toward Mixed Analog-Digital Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum AD/DA Conversion and the Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal processing stands as a pillar of classical computation and modern information technology, applicable to both analog and digital signals. Recently, advancements in quantum information science have suggested that quantum signal processing (QSP) can enable more powerful signal processing capabilities. However, the developments in QSP have primarily leveraged \emph{digital} quantum resources, such as discrete-variable (DV) systems like qubits, rather than \emph{analog} quantum resources, such as continuous-variable (CV) systems like quantum oscillators. Consequently, there remains a gap in understanding how signal processing can be performed on hybrid CV-DV quantum computers. Here we address this gap by developing a new paradigm of mixed analog-digital QSP. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm by showcasing how it naturally enables analog-digital conversion of quantum signals -- specifically, the transfer of states between DV and CV quantum systems. We then show that such quantum analog-digital conversion enables new implementations of quantum algorithms on CV-DV hardware. This is exemplified by realizing the quantum Fourier transform of a state encoded on qubits via the free-evolution of a quantum oscillator, albeit with a runtime exponential in the number of qubits due to information theoretic arguments. Collectively, this work marks a significant step forward in hybrid CV-DV quantum computation, providing a foundation for scalable analog-digital signal processing on quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Optimal Joint Radar and Communication User Association in Cell-Free mMIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are crucial for 6G development due to their high spectral efficiency and uniform user-experienced data rates. A key aspect of CF-mMIMO is user association (UA) and optimal cluster formation. Traditional methods focusing solely on communication-related metrics fall short in this context, as sensing is becoming integral to 6G. This study delves into a framework for joint radar and communication (JRC) in CF-mMIMO systems and investigates JRC-based UA techniques. We propose a novel method to optimize UA, enhancing both communication spectral efficiency and sensing accuracy. Existing literature has not explored this dual requirement integration for UA. Our proposed two-step scheme optimizes UA clusters for both communication and sensing. The first step involves selecting access points (APs) based on channel quality, followed by a second step that further refines the selection by choosing APs from the initial group that are also optimal for sensing. We utilize the signal-clutter plus noise ratio to exclude APs with clutter in front of the user equipment (UE) and the AP view angle, ensuring that radar echoes are received only from the specific UE, not the surrounding clutter. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the same APs optimized for communication are not necessarily optimal for sensing, highlighting the need for schemes that incorporate sensing requirements in UA. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing its potential to improve CF-mMIMO system performance in JRC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low-Complexity, Non-Linear Processing for MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear detection schemes can substantially improve the achievable throughput and connectivity capabilities of uplink MU-MIMO systems that employ linear detection. However, the complexity requirements of existing non-linear soft detectors that provide substantial gains compared to linear ones are at least an order of magnitude more complex, making their adoption challenging. In particular, joint soft information computation involves solving multiple vector minimization problems, each with a complexity that scales exponentially with the number of users. This work introduces a novel ultra-low-complexity, non-linear detection scheme that performs joint Detection and Approximate Reliability Estimation (DARE). For the first time, DARE can substantially improve the achievable throughput (e.g., 40%) with less than 2x the complexity of linear MMSE, making non-linear processing extremely practical. To enable this, DARE includes a novel procedure to approximate the reliability of the received bits based on the region of the received observable that can efficiently approach the accurately calculated soft detection performance. In addition, we show that DARE can achieve a better throughput than linear detection when using just half the base station antennas, resulting in substantial power savings (e.g., 500 W). Consequently, DARE is a very strong candidate for future power-efficient MU-MIMO developments, even in the case of software-based implementations, as in the case of emerging Open-RAN systems. Furthermore, DARE can achieve the throughput of the state-of-the-art non-linear detectors with complexity requirements that are orders of magnitude lower.</description>

      <title>A High Altitude Platform-Based 3D Geometrical Channel Model for Beamforming Characterization in Future 6G Flying Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing requirements of future wireless communication systems, such as high data rates, high reliability, and low latency, make the active usage of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) an inevitable necessity. In this regard, High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) have drawn great attention in recent years due to their unique characteristics such as high coverage, long operational durability, and ad-hoc movement. However, for the active usage of HAPs, channel models for their various usage scenarios must be well-defined, especially in those cases where the sophisticated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, such as beamforming, are utilized to increase the data rate. Therefore, in this study, an air-to-air (A2A) three dimensional (3D) geometrical channel model is proposed to characterize the beamforming capabilities of non-stationary HAP networks operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. In this regard, the 3D geometry of the two HAPs in the air is analyzed, and the effect of Doppler due to the movement of HAPs is interrogated as well as its effect on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The final outputs of this study show that the proposed A2A channel model is applicable to characterize the future sixth generation (6G) HAP networks when the mmWave is used to utilize beamforming with a large number of antennas.</description>

      <title>Novel Road-Aware Line-of-Sight Probability Model for Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urban air mobility (UAM) emerges as a transformative solution to urban transportation, the demand for robust communication frameworks capable of supporting high-density aerial traffic becomes increasingly critical. An essential area of communications improvement is reliably characterizing and minimizing interference on UAM aircraft from other aircraft and ground vehicles. To achieve this, reliable and accurate line-of-sight (LOS) models must be used. In this work, we highlight the limitations of a LOS probability model extensively used in the literature in accurately predicting interference caused by smart ground vehicles. Then, we introduce a novel probability of LOS model that improves interference prediction by incorporating the urban topography and the dynamic positioning of ground vehicles on streets. Our model's parameters are derived from extensive simulations and validated through real-world urban settings to ensure reliability and applicability.</description>

      <title>RISE-iEEG: Robust to Inter-Subject Electrodes Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilization of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is rapidly increasing for clinical and brain-computer interface applications. iEEG facilitates the recording of neural activity with high spatial and temporal resolution, making it a desirable neuroimaging modality for studying neural dynamics. Despite its benefits, iEEG faces challenges such as inter-subject variability in electrode implantation, which makes the development of unified neural decoder models across different patients difficult. In this research, we introduce a novel decoder model that is robust to inter-subject electrode implantation variability. We call this model RISE-iEEG, which stands for Robust Inter-Subject Electrode Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier. RISE-iEEG employs a deep neural network structure preceded by a patient-specific projection network. The projection network maps the neural data of individual patients onto a common low-dimensional space, compensating for the implantation variability. In other words, we developed an iEEG decoder model that can be applied across multiple patients' data without requiring the coordinates of electrode for each patient. The performance of RISE-iEEG across multiple datasets, including the Audio-Visual dataset, Music Reconstruction dataset, and Upper-Limb Movement dataset, surpasses that of state-of-the-art iEEG decoder models such as HTNet and EEGNet. Our analysis shows that the performance of RISE-iEEG is 10\% higher than that of HTNet and EEGNet in terms of F1 score, with an average F1 score of 83\%, which is the highest result among the evaluation methods defined. Furthermore, the analysis of projection network weights in the Music Reconstruction dataset across patients suggests that the Superior Temporal lobe serves as the primary encoding neural node. This finding aligns with the auditory processing physiology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the unprecedented mobile traffic demands of future wireless networks, a paradigm shift from conventional cellular networks to distributed communication systems is imperative. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) represents a practical and scalable embodiment of distributed/network MIMO systems. It inherits not only the key benefits of co-located massive MIMO systems but also the macro-diversity gains from distributed systems. This innovative architecture has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing network performance from various perspectives, outperforming co-located mMIMO and conventional small-cell systems. Moreover, CF-mMIMO offers flexibility in integration with emerging wireless technologies such as full-duplex (FD), non-orthogonal transmission schemes, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided communication, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this paper, we provide an overview of current research efforts on CF-mMIMO systems and their promising future application scenarios. We then elaborate on new requirements for CF-mMIMO networks in the context of these technological breakthroughs. We also present several current open challenges and outline future research directions aimed at fully realizing the potential of CF mMIMO systems in meeting the evolving demands of future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Is Audio Spoof Detection Robust to Laundering Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy. However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases, such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.</description>

      <title>Quartered Chirp Spectral Envelope for Whispered vs Normal Speech Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whispered speech as an acceptable form of human-computer interaction is gaining traction. Systems that address multiple modes of speech require a robust front-end speech classifier. Performance of whispered vs normal speech classification drops in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, since normal speech takes on some of the characteristics of whispered speech. In this work, we propose a new feature named the quartered chirp spectral envelope, a combination of the chirp spectrum and the quartered spectral envelope, to classify whispered and normal speech. The chirp spectrum can be fine-tuned to obtain customized features for a given task, and the quartered spectral envelope has been proven to work especially well for the current task. The feature is trained on a one dimensional convolutional neural network, that captures the trends in the spectral envelope. The proposed system performs better than the state of the art, in the presence of white noise.</description>

      <title>Generative-AI for AI/ML Model Adaptive Retraining in Beyond 5G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks aim to support high data rates, low-latency applications, and massive machine communications. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) can help to improve B5G network performance and efficiency. However, dynamic service demands of B5G use cases cause AI/ML model performance degradation, resulting in Service Level Agreements (SLA) violations, over- or under-provisioning of resources, etc. Retraining is essential to address the performance degradation of the AI/ML models. Existing threshold and periodic retraining approaches have potential disadvantages, such as SLA violations and inefficient resource utilization for setting a threshold parameter in a dynamic environment. This paper proposes a novel approach that predicts when to retrain AI/ML models using Generative Artificial Intelligence. The proposed predictive approach is evaluated for a Quality of Service Prediction use case on the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Software Community platform and compared to the predictive approach based on the classifier and a threshold approach. Also, a realtime dataset from the Colosseum testbed is considered to evaluate Network Slicing (NS) use case with the proposed predictive approach. The results show that the proposed predictive approach outperforms both the classifier-based predictive and threshold approaches.</description>

      <title>Correntropy-Based Improper Likelihood Model for Robust Electrophysiological Source Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian learning provides a unified skeleton to solve the electrophysiological source imaging task. From this perspective, existing source imaging algorithms utilize the Gaussian assumption for the observation noise to build the likelihood function for Bayesian inference. However, the electromagnetic measurements of brain activity are usually affected by miscellaneous artifacts, leading to a potentially non-Gaussian distribution for the observation noise. Hence the conventional Gaussian likelihood model is a suboptimal choice for the real-world source imaging task. In this study, we aim to solve this problem by proposing a new likelihood model which is robust with respect to non-Gaussian noises. Motivated by the robust maximum correntropy criterion, we propose a new improper distribution model concerning the noise assumption. This new noise distribution is leveraged to structure a robust likelihood function and integrated with hierarchical prior distributions to estimate source activities by variational inference. In particular, the score matching is adopted to determine the hyperparameters for the improper likelihood model. A comprehensive performance evaluation is performed to compare the proposed noise assumption to the conventional Gaussian model. Simulation results show that, the proposed method can realize more precise source reconstruction by designing known ground-truth. The real-world dataset also demonstrates the superiority of our new method with the visual perception task. This study provides a new backbone for Bayesian source imaging, which would facilitate its application using real-world noisy brain signal.</description>

Abstract: The advancement of computer image processing, pattern recognition, signal processing, and other technologies has gradually replaced the manual methods of classifying fruit with computer and mechanical methods. In the field of agriculture, the intelligent classification of post-harvested fruit has enabled the use of smart devices that creates a direct impact on farmers, especially on export products. For coconut classification, it remains to be traditional in process. This study presents a classification of the coconut dataset based on acoustic signals. To address the imbalanced dataset, a data augmentation technique was conducted through audiomentation and procedural audio generation methods. Audio signals under premature, mature, and overmature now have 4,050, 4,050, and 5,850 audio signals, respectively. To address the updation of the classification system and the classification accuracy performance, deep learning models were utilized for classifying the generated audio signals from data generation. Specifically, RNN and LSTM models were trained and tested, and their performances were compared with each other and the machine learning methods used by Caladcad et al. (2020). The two DL models showed impressive performance with both having an accuracy of 97.42% and neither of them outperformed the other since there are no significant differences in their classification performance.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Based Modelling and Analysis of Uplink Cooperative Satellite-Aerial-Terrestrial Networks for Nomadic Communications with Weak Satellite Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative satellite-aerial-terrestrial networks (CSATNs), where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are utilized as nomadic aerial relays (A), are highly valuable for many important applications, such as post-disaster urban reconstruction. In this scenario, direct communication between terrestrial terminals (T) and satellites (S) is often unavailable due to poor propagation conditions for satellite signals, and users tend to congregate in regions of finite size. There is a current dearth in the open literature regarding the uplink performance analysis of CSATN operating under the above constraints, and the few contributions on the uplink model terrestrial terminals by a Poisson point process (PPP) relying on the unrealistic assumption of an infinite area. This paper aims to fill the above research gap. First, we propose a stochastic geometry based innovative model to characterize the impact of the finite-size distribution region of terrestrial terminals in the CSATN by jointly using a binomial point process (BPP) and a type-II Mat{\'e}rn hard-core point process (MHCPP). Then, we analyze the relationship between the spatial distribution of the coverage areas of aerial nodes and the finite-size distribution region of terrestrial terminals, thereby deriving the distance distribution of the T-A links. Furthermore, we consider the stochastic nature of the spatial distributions of terrestrial terminals and UAVs, and conduct a thorough analysis of the coverage probability and average ergodic rate of the T-A links under Nakagami fading and the A-S links under shadowed-Rician fading. Finally, the accuracy of our theoretical derivations are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Our research offers fundamental insights into the system-level performance optimization for the realistic CSATNs involving nomadic aerial relays and terrestrial terminals confined in a finite-size region.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of RIS-Aided Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of emerging fluid antenna systems (FAS) on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided secure communications. Specifically, we consider a classic wiretap channel, where a fixed-antenna transmitter sends confidential information to an FAS-equipped legitimate user with the help of an RIS, while an FAS-equipped eavesdropper attempts to decode the message. To evaluate the proposed wireless scenario, we first introduce the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each node, using the central limit theorem and the Gaussian copula function. We then derive a compact analytical expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Our numerical results reveal how the incorporation of FAS and RIS can significantly enhance the performance of secure communications.</description>

      <title>Alternating Minimization Schemes for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions with $f$-Divergence Perception Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint that belongs to the family of $f$-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize the optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to the presence of implicit equations in the structure of the iteration. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton's root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal iteration solution, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on a relaxation of the OAM iterates. Both schemes are shown, via the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions, to guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and the perception constraints which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and draw connections with existing results.</description>

      <title>CR-Enabled NOMA Integrated Non-Terrestrial IoT Networks with Transmissive RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a T-RIS-equipped LEO satellite communication in cognitive radio-enabled integrated NTNs. In the proposed system, a GEO satellite operates as a primary network, and a T-RIS-equipped LEO satellite operates as a secondary IoT network. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of T-RIS-equipped LEO satellite communication using downlink NOMA while ensuring the service quality of GEO cellular users. Our framework simultaneously optimizes the total transmit power of LEO, NOMA power allocation for LEO IoT (LIoT) and T-RIS phase shift design subject to the service quality of LIoT and interference temperature to the primary GEO network. To solve the non-convex sum rate maximization problem, we first adopt successive convex approximations to reduce the complexity of the formulated optimization. Then, we divide the problem into two parts, i.e., power allocation of LEO and phase shift design of T-RIS. The power allocation problem is solved using KKT conditions, while the phase shift problem is handled by Taylor approximation and semidefinite programming. Numerical results are provided to validate the proposed optimization framework.</description>

      <title>GEM: A GEneral Memristive transistor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic devices, with their distinct advantages in energy efficiency and parallel processing, are pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence applications. Among these devices, memristive transistors have attracted significant attention due to their superior symmetry, stability, and retention characteristics compared to two-terminal memristors. However, the lack of a robust model that accurately captures their complex electrical behavior has hindered further exploration of their potential. In this work, we present the GEneral Memristive transistor model (GEM), a comprehensive voltage-controlled model that addresses this gap. The GEM model incorporates a state-dependent update function, a voltage-controlled moving window function, and a nonlinear current output function, enabling precise representation of the electrical characteristics of memristive transistors. In experiments, the GEM model not only demonstrates a 300% improvement in modeling the memory behavior but also accurately captures the inherent nonlinearities and physical limits of these devices. This advancement significantly enhances the realistic simulation of memristive transistors, thereby facilitating further exploration and application development.</description>

      <title>Channel State Acquisition in Uplink NOMA for Cellular-Connected UAV: Exploitation of Doppler and Modulation Diversities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance or monitoring applications into fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) cellular networks is an intriguing problem that has recently tackled a lot of interest in both academia and industry. For an efficient spectrum usage, we consider a recently-proposed sky-ground nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where a cellular-connected UAV acting as aerial user (AU) and a static terrestrial user (TU) are paired to simultaneously transmit their uplink signals to a base station (BS) in the same time-frequency resource blocks. In such a case, due to the highly dynamic nature of the UAV, the signal transmitted by the AU experiences both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by Doppler shifts. On the other hand, for a static ground network, frequency dispersion of the signal transmitted by the TU is negligible and only multipath effects have to be taken into account. To decode the superposed signals at the BS through successive interference cancellation, accurate estimates of both the AU and TU channels are needed. In this paper, we propose channel estimation procedures that suitably exploit the different circular/noncircular modulation formats (modulation diversity) and the different almost-cyclostationarity features (Doppler diversity) of the AU and TU by means of widely-linear time-varying processing. Our estimation approach is semi-blind since Doppler shifts and time delays of the AU are estimated based on the received data only, whereas the remaining relevant parameters of the AU and TU channels are acquired relying also on the available training symbols, which are transmitted by the AU and TU in a nonorthogonal manner.</description>

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) of wireless technology is seen as one of the enablers of real-time fusion of the physical and digital realms, as in Digital Twin, eXtended reality, or the Metaverse. This would allow people to interact, work, and entertain themselves in an immersive social network of online 3D~virtual environments. From the viewpoint of communication and networking, this will represent an evolution of the \emph{game networking} technology, designed to interconnect massive users in real-time online gaming environments. This article presents the basic principles of game networking and discusses their evolution towards meeting the requirements of the Metaverse and similar applications. Several open research challenges are discussed, along with possible solutions through experimental case studies.</description>

      <title>Creating Temporally Correlated High-Resolution Profiles of Load Injection Using Constrained Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional smart meters, which measure energy usage every 15 minutes or more and report it at least a few hours later, lack the granularity needed for real-time decision-making. To address this practical problem, we introduce a new method using generative adversarial networks (GAN) that enforces temporal consistency on its high-resolution outputs via hard inequality constraints using convex optimization. A unique feature of our GAN model is that it is trained solely on slow timescale aggregated historical energy data obtained from smart meters. The results demonstrate that the model can successfully create minute-by-minute temporally correlated profiles of power usage from 15-minute interval average power consumption information. This innovative approach, emphasizing inter-neuron constraints, offers a promising avenue for improved high-speed state estimation in distribution systems and enhances the applicability of data-driven solutions for monitoring and subsequently controlling such systems.</description>

Abstract: Recently, movable antenna (MA) array becomes a promising technology for improving the communication quality in wireless communication systems. In this letter, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled multi-user multi-input-single-output system enhanced by the MA array is investigated. To enhance the throughput capacity, we aim to maximize the achievable data rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the UAV trajectory, and the positions of the MA array antennas. The formulated data rate maximization problem is a highly coupled non-convex problem, for which an alternating optimization based algorithm is proposed to get a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results have demonstrated the performance gain of the proposed method compared with conventional method with fixed-position antenna array.</description>

Abstract: The ubiquity of multiscale interactions in complex systems is well-recognized, with development and heredity serving as a prime example of how processes at different temporal scales influence one another. This work introduces a novel multiscale state-space model to explore the dynamic interplay between systems interacting across different time scales, with feedback between each scale. We propose a Bayesian learning framework to estimate unknown states by learning the unknown process noise covariances within this multiscale model. We develop a Particle Gibbs with Ancestor Sampling (PGAS) algorithm for inference and demonstrate through simulations the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces as Spatial Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) is typically based on treating the RIS as an infinitely large surface that steers incident plane waves toward the desired direction. In practical implementations, however, the RIS has finite size and the incident wave is a beam of finite $k$-content, rather than a plane wave of $\delta$-like $k$-content. To understand the implications of the finite extent of both the RIS and the incident beam, here we treat the RIS as a spatial filter, the transfer function of which is determined by both the prescribed RIS operation and the shape of the RIS boundary. Following this approach, we study how the RIS transforms the incident $k$-content and we demonstrate how, by engineering the RIS shape, size, and response, it is possible to shape beams with nontrivial $k$-content to suppress unwanted interference, while concentrating the reflected power to desired directions. We also demonstrate how our framework, when applied in the context of near-field communications, provides the necessary insights into how the wavefront of the beam is tailored to enable focusing, propagation with invariant profile, and bending, beyond conventional beamforming.</description>

      <title>Localization in Dynamic Indoor MIMO-OFDM Wireless Systems using Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for predicting the location of user equipment (UE) using wireless fingerprints in dynamic indoor non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. In particular, our method copes with the challenges posed by the drift, birth, and death of scattering clusters resulting from dynamic changes in the wireless environment. Prominent examples of such dynamic wireless environments include factory floors or offices, where the geometry of the environment undergoes changes over time. These changes affect the distribution of wireless fingerprints, demonstrating some similarity between the distributions before and after the change. Consequently, the performance of a location estimator initially designed for a specific environment may degrade significantly when applied after changes have occurred in that environment. To address this limitation, we propose a domain adaptation framework that utilizes neural networks to align the distributions of wireless fingerprints collected both before and after environmental changes. By aligning these distributions, we design an estimator capable of predicting UE locations from their wireless fingerprints in the new environment. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in localizing UEs in dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>A Superdirective Beamforming Approach based on MultiTransUNet-GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, the antenna spacing is often no smaller than half a wavelength. However, by exploiting the coupling between more closely-spaced antennas, a superdirective array may achieve a much higher beamforming gain than traditional MIMO. In this paper, we present a novel utilization of neural networks in the context of superdirective arrays. Specifically, a new model called MultiTransUNet-GAN is proposed, which aims to forecast the excitation coefficients to achieve ``superdirectivity" or ``super-gain" in the compact uniform linear or planar antenna arrays. In this model, we integrate a multi-level guided attention and a multi-scale skip connection. Furthermore, generative adversarial networks are integrated into our model. To improve the prediction accuracy and convergence speed of our model, we introduce the warm up aided cosine learning rate (LR) schedule during the model training, and the objective function is improved by incorporating the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) between the generated value and the actual value. Simulations demonstrate that the array directivity and array gain achieved by our model exhibit a strong agreement with the theoretical values. Overall, it shows the advantage of enhanced precision over the existing models, and a reduced requirement for measurement and the computation of the excitation coefficients.</description>

Abstract: This project describes the application of the technologies of Machine Learning and Internet-of-Things to assess the lower limb strength of individuals undergoing rehabilitation or therapy. Specifically, it seeks to measure and assess the progress of individuals by sensors attached to chairs and processing the data through Google GPU Tensorflow CoLab. Pressure sensors are attached to various locations on a chair, including but not limited to the seating area, backrest, hand rests, and legs. Sensor data from the individual performing both sit-to-stand transition and stand-to-sit transition provides a time series dataset regarding the pressure distribution and vibratory motion on the chair. The dataset and timing information can then be fed into a machine learning model to estimate the relative strength and weakness during various phases of the movement.</description>

      <title>SBMA: A Multiple Access Scheme with High Diversity and Multiplexing Gains for Next-gen Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies advanced multi-access techniques to support high volumes of concurrent access in wireless networks. Sparse code multiple access (SCMA), as a code-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), serves multiple users simultaneously by adopting frequency-domain coding. Blind Interference Alignment, in contrast, applies time-domain coding to accommodate multiple users. Unlike beamforming, both of them need no Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT), which saves control overheads on channel information feedback. To further increase multiplexing gain and diversity order, we propose a new multiple access framework, which utilizes both time and frequency coding by combining SCMA and BIA, which is SBMA (Sparsecode-and-BIA-based multiple access). Two decoding schemes, namely the two-stage decoding scheme consisting of zero-forcing and Message Passing Algorithm (MPA), and the Joint Message Passing Algorithm (JMPA) enhanced by constructing a virtual factor graph, have been analyzed. Simulation results indicate that although the performance of the two-stage decoding scheme is inferior to both BIA and SCMA, it has a relatively low decoding complexity. Nonetheless, the JMPA decoding scheme achieves the same diversity gain as an STBC-based SCMA and with an even higher multiplexing gain, which makes the SBMA with JMPA decoding scheme a promising MA scheme for next-gen wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data publishing under privacy constraints can be achieved with mechanisms that add randomness to data points when released to an untrusted party, thereby decreasing the data's utility. In this paper, we analyze this privacy-utility tradeoff for the pointwise maximal leakage privacy measure and a general class of convex utility functions. Pointwise maximal leakage (PML) was recently proposed as an operationally meaningful privacy measure based on two equivalent threat models: An adversary guessing a randomized function and an adversary aiming to maximize a general gain function. We study the behavior of the randomized response mechanism designed for local differential privacy under different prior distributions of the private data. Motivated by the findings of this analysis, we derive several closed-form solutions for the optimal privacy-utility tradeoff in the presented PML context using tools from convex analysis. Finally, we present a linear program that can compute optimal mechanisms for PML in a general setting.</description>

      <title>Graph GOSPA metric: a metric to measure the discrepancy between graphs of different sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a metric to measure the dissimilarity between graphs that may have a different number of nodes. The proposed metric extends the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric, which is a metric for sets, to graphs. The proposed graph GOSPA metric includes costs associated with node attribute errors for properly assigned nodes, missed and false nodes and edge mismatches between graphs. The computation of this metric is based on finding the optimal assignments between nodes in the two graphs, with the possibility of leaving some of the nodes unassigned. We also propose a lower bound for the metric, which is also a metric for graphs and is computable in polynomial time using linear programming. The metric is first derived for undirected unweighted graphs and it is then extended to directed and weighted graphs. The properties of the metric are demonstrated via simulated and empirical datasets.</description>

      <title>Dual-Functional Artificial Noise (DFAN) Aided Robust Covert Communications in Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates covert communications in an integrated sensing and communications system, where a dual-functional base station (called Alice) covertly transmits signals to a covert user (called Bob) while sensing multiple targets, with one of them acting as a potential watcher (called Willie) and maliciously eavesdropping on legitimate communications. To shelter the covert communications, Alice transmits additional dual-functional artificial noise (DFAN) with a varying power not only to create uncertainty at Willie's signal reception to confuse Willie but also to sense the targets simultaneously. Based on this framework, the weighted sum of the sensing beampattern means square error (MSE) and cross correlation is minimized by jointly optimizing the covert communication and DFAN signals subject to the minimum covert rate requirement. The robust design considers both cases of imperfect Willie's CSI (WCSI) and statistical WCSI. Under the worst-case assumption that Willie can adaptively adjust the detection threshold to achieve the best detection performance, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) at Willie is analytically derived in the closed-form expression. The formulated covertness constrained optimization problems are tackled by a feasibility-checking based difference-of-convex relaxation (DC) algorithm utilizing the S-procedure, Bernstein-type inequality, and the DC method. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the covertness performance gains achieved by our proposed design over various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Successive Interference Cancellation for Non-Linear Bandlimited Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable communication over bandlimited and non-linear channels usually requires equalization to simplify receiver processing. Equalizers that perform joint detection and decoding (JDD) achieve the highest information rates but are often too complex to implement. To address this challenge, model-based neural network (NN) equalizers that perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) are shown to approach JDD information rates for bandlimited channels with a memoryless nonlinearity and additive white Gaussian noise. The NNs are chosen to have a periodically time-varying and recurrent structure that imitates the forward-backward algorithm (FBA) in every SIC stage. Simulations for short-haul fiber-optic links with square-law detection show that NN-SIC nearly doubles current spectral efficiencies, and bipolar or complex-valued modulations achieve energy gains of up to 3dB compared to state-of-the-art intensity modulation. Moreover, NN-SIC is considerably less complex than equalizers that perform JDD, mismatched FBA processing, and Gibbs sampling.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems in High-Mobility Scenarios: Instantaneous Model or Statistical Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical linear statistical models, like the first-order auto-regressive (AR) model, are commonly used as channel model in high-mobility scenarios. However, compared to sub-6G, the effect of Doppler frequency shifts is more significant at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, and the effectiveness of the statistical channel model in high-mobility mmWave scenarios should be reconsidered. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation for mmWave multiple-input multiple-output-(MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in high-mobility scenarios, with the focus on the comparison between the instantaneous channel model and the statistical channel model. For the instantaneous model, by leveraging the low-rank nature of mmWave channels and the multidimensional characteristics of MIMO-OFDM signals across space, time, and frequency, the received signals are structured as a fourth-order tensor fitting a low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model. Then, to solve the CP decomposition problem, an estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT)-type decomposition based channel estimation method is proposed by exploring the Vandermonde structure of factor matrix, and the channel parameters are then estimated from the factor matrices. We analyze the uniqueness condition of the CP decomposition and develop a concise derivation of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for channel parameters. Simulations show that our method outperforms the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, the results based on the wireless environment generated by Wireless InSite verify that the channel estimation based on the instantaneous channel model performs better than that based on the statistical channel model. Therefore, the instantaneous channel model is recommended for designing channel estimation algorithm for mmWave systems in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 77%.</description>

      <title>Localising the Seizure Onset Zone from Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation Responses with a CNN Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, often requiring surgical intervention when medication fails to control seizures. For effective surgical outcomes, precise localisation of the epileptogenic focus - often approximated through the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is critical yet remains a challenge. Active probing through electrical stimulation is already standard clinical practice for identifying epileptogenic areas. Our study advances the application of deep learning for SOZ localisation using Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) responses, with two key contributions. Firstly, we implement an existing deep learning model to compare two SPES analysis paradigms: divergent and convergent. These paradigms evaluate outward and inward effective connections, respectively. We assess the generalisability of these models to unseen patients and electrode placements using held-out test sets. Our findings reveal a notable improvement in moving from a divergent (AUROC: 0.574) to a convergent approach (AUROC: 0.666), marking the first application of the latter in this context. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNN Transformers with cross-channel attention in handling heterogeneous electrode placements, increasing the AUROC to 0.730. These findings represent a significant step in modelling patient-specific intracranial EEG electrode placements in SPES. Future work will explore integrating these models into clinical decision-making processes to bridge the gap between deep learning research and practical healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model for Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomic nervous system is important for cardiac function regulation. Modeling of autonomic cardiac regulation can contribute to health tracking and disease management. This study proposed a mathematical model that simulates autonomic cardiac regulation response to Valsalva Maneuver, which is a commonly used test that provokes the autonomic nervous system. Dataset containing skin sympathetic nervous activity extracted from healthy participants' ECG was used to validate the model. In the data collection procedure, each participant was required to perform Valsalva Maneuver. The preliminary result of modeling for one subject is presented, and the model validation result showed that the root measure square error between the simulated and measured average skin sympathetic nervous activity is 0.01$\mu$V. The model is expected to be further developed, evaluated using the dataset including 41 subjects, and ultimately applied for capturing the early signs of cardiac dysfunction in the future.</description>
