      <title>A Note on the Core of 2-Matching Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative 2-matching games are a generalization of cooperative matching games, where the value function is given by maximum-weight b-matchings, for a vertex capacity vector $b \leq 2$. We show how to separate over the core of 2-matching games in polynomial time, fixing a small flaw in the literature, and prove the existence of a compact extended formulation for it.</description>

      <title>Minimization I.I.D. Prophet Inequality via Extreme Value Theory: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The I.I.D. Prophet Inequality is a fundamental problem where, given $n$ independent random variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$ drawn from a known distribution $\mathcal{D}$, one has to decide at every step $i$ whether to stop and accept $X_i$ or discard it forever and continue. The goal is to maximize or minimize the selected value and compete against the all-knowing prophet. For maximization, a tight constant-competitive guarantee of $\approx 0.745$ is well-known (Correa et al, 2019), whereas minimization is qualitatively different: the optimal constant is distribution-dependent and can be arbitrarily large (Livanos and Mehta, 2024).
  In this paper, we provide a novel framework via the lens of Extreme Value Theory to analyze optimal threshold algorithms. We show that the competitive ratio for the minimization setting has a closed form described by a function $\Lambda$, which depends only on the extreme value index $\gamma$; in particular, it corresponds to $\Lambda(\gamma)$ for $\gamma \leq 0$. Despite the contrast of maximization and minimization, our framework turns out to be universal and we recover the results of (Kennedy and Kertz, 1991) for maximization as well. Surprisingly, the optimal competitive ratio for maximization is given by the same function $\Lambda(\gamma)$, but for $\gamma \geq 0$. Along the way, we obtain several results on the algorithm and the prophet's objectives from the perspective of extreme value theory, which might be of independent interest.
  We next study single-threshold algorithms for minimization. Using extreme value theory, we generalize the results of (Livanos and Mehta, 2024) which hold only for special classes of distributions, and obtain poly-logarithmic in $n$ guarantees. Finally, we consider the $k$-multi-unit prophet inequality for minimization and show that there exist constant-competitive single-threshold algorithms when $k \geq \log{n}$.</description>

      <title>EF1 Allocations for Identical Trilean and Separable Single-Peaked Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fair division of items among interested agents, envy-freeness is possibly the most favoured and widely studied formalisation of fairness. For indivisible items, envy-free allocations may not exist in trivial cases, and hence research and practice focus on relaxations, particularly envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). A significant reason for the popularity of EF1 allocations is its simple fact of existence. It is known that EF1 allocations exist for two agents with arbitrary valuations; agents with doubly-monotone valuations; agents with Boolean valuations; and identical agents with negative Boolean valuations.
  We consider two new but natural classes of valuations, and partly extend results on the existence of EF1 allocations to these valuations. Firstly, we consider trilean valuations - an extension of Boolean valuations - when the value of any subset is 0, $a$, or $b$ for any integers $a$ and $b$. Secondly, we define separable single-peaked valuations, when the set of items is partitioned into types. For each type, an agent's value is a single-peaked function of the number of items of the type. The value for a set of items is the sum of values for the different types. We prove EF1 existence for identical trilean valuations for any number of agents, and for separable single-peaked valuations for three agents. For both classes of valuations, we also show that EFX allocations do not exist.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Approach to the Study of Blockchain's Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchains have sparked global interest in recent years, gaining importance as they increasingly influence technology and finance. This thesis investigates the robustness of blockchain protocols, specifically focusing on Ethereum Proof-of-Stake. We define robustness in terms of two critical properties: Safety, which ensures that the blockchain will not have permanent conflicting blocks, and Liveness, which guarantees the continuous addition of new reliable blocks.
  Our research addresses the gap between traditional distributed systems approaches, which classify agents as either honest or Byzantine (i.e., malicious or faulty), and game-theoretic models that consider rational agents driven by incentives. We explore how incentives impact the robustness with both approaches.
  The thesis comprises three distinct analyses. First, we formalize the Ethereum PoS protocol, defining its properties and examining potential vulnerabilities through a distributed systems perspective. We identify that certain attacks can undermine the system's robustness. Second, we analyze the inactivity leak mechanism, a critical feature of Ethereum PoS, highlighting its role in maintaining system liveness during network disruptions but at the cost of safety. Finally, we employ game-theoretic models to study the strategies of rational validators within Ethereum PoS, identifying conditions under which these agents might deviate from the prescribed protocol to maximize their rewards.
  Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the importance of incentive mechanisms for blockchain robustness and provide insights into designing more resilient blockchain protocols.</description>

      <title>Tractable Agreement Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient reduction that converts any machine learning algorithm into an interactive protocol, enabling collaboration with another party (e.g., a human) to achieve consensus on predictions and improve accuracy. This approach imposes calibration conditions on each party, which are computationally and statistically tractable relaxations of Bayesian rationality. These conditions are sensible even in prior-free settings, representing a significant generalization of Aumann's classic "agreement theorem."
  In our protocol, the model first provides a prediction. The human then responds by either agreeing or offering feedback. The model updates its state and revises its prediction, while the human may adjust their beliefs. This iterative process continues until the two parties reach agreement. Initially, we study a setting that extends Aumann's Agreement Theorem, where parties aim to agree on a one-dimensional expectation by iteratively sharing their current estimates. Here, we recover the convergence theorem of Aaronson'05 under weaker assumptions. We then address the case where parties hold beliefs over distributions with d outcomes, exploring two feedback mechanisms. The first involves vector-valued estimates of predictions, while the second adopts a decision-theoretic approach: the human, needing to take an action from a finite set based on utility, communicates their utility-maximizing action at each round. In this setup, the number of rounds until agreement remains independent of d. Finally, we generalize to scenarios with more than two parties, where computational complexity scales linearly with the number of participants. Our protocols rely on simple, efficient conditions and produce predictions that surpass the accuracy of any individual party's alone.</description>

      <title>First-order (coarse) correlated equilibria in non-concave games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate first-order notions of correlated equilibria; distributions of actions for smooth, potentially non-concave games such that players do not incur any regret against small modifications to their strategies along a set of continuous vector fields. We define two such notions, based on local deviations and on stationarity of the distribution, and identify the notion of coarseness as the setting where the associated vector fields are in fact gradient fields. For coarse equilibria, we prove that online (projected) gradient decent has a universal approximation property for both variants of equilibrium. In the non-coarse setting, we instead reduce the problem of finding an equilibrium to fixed-point computation via the usual framework of $\Phi$-regret minimisation, and identify tractable instances. Finally, we study the primal-dual framework to our notion of first-order equilibria. For coarse equilibria defined by a family of functions, we find that a dual bound on the worst-case expectation of a performance metric takes the form of a generalised Lyapunov function for the dynamics of the game. Specifically, usual primal-dual price of anarchy analysis for coarse correlated equilibria as well as the smoothness framework of Roughgarden are both equivalent to a problem of general Lyapunov function estimation. For non-coarse equilibria, we instead observe a vector field fit problem for the gradient dynamics of the game. These follow from containment results in normal form games; the usual notion of a (coarse) correlated equilibria is equivalent to our first-order local notions of (coarse) correlated equilibria with respect to an appropriately chosen set of vector fields.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Graph Exploration Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Exploration problems ask a searcher to explore an unknown environment. The environment is modeled as a graph, where the searcher needs to visit each vertex beginning at some vertex. Treasure Hunt problems are a variation of Graph Exploration, in which the searcher needs to find a hidden treasure, which is located at a designated vertex. Usually these problems are modeled as online problems, and any online algorithm performs poorly because it has too little knowledge about the instance to react adequately to the requests of the adversary. Thus, the impact of a priori knowledge is of interest. One form of a priori knowledge is an unlabeled map, which is an isomorphic copy of the graph. We analyze Graph Exploration and Treasure Hunt problems with an unlabeled map that is provided to the searcher. For this, we formulate decision variants of both problems by interpreting the online problems as a game between the online algorithm (the searcher) and the adversary. The map, however, is not controllable by the adversary. The question is whether the searcher is able to explore the graph completely or find the treasure for all possible decisions of the adversary. We analyze these games in multiple settings, with and without costs on the edges, on directed and undirected graphs and with different constraints (allowing multiple visits to vertices or edges) on the solution. We prove PSPACE-completeness for most of these games. Additionally, we analyze the complexity of related problems that have additional constraints on the solution.</description>

      <title>Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</description>
