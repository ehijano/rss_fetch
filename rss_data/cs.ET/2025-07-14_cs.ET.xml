      <title>Rethinking Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection: A Vision for Causality-Driven Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.</description>

      <title>TruChain: A Multi-Layer Architecture for Trusted, Verifiable, and Immutable Open Banking Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open banking framework enables third party providers to access financial data across banking institutions, leading to unprecedented innovations in the financial sector. However, some open banking standards remain susceptible to severe technological risks, including unverified data sources, inconsistent data integrity, and lack of immutability. In this paper, we propose a layered architecture that provides assurance in data trustworthiness with three distinct levels of trust, covering source validation, data-level authentication, and tamper-proof storage. The first layer guarantees the source legitimacy using decentralized identity and verifiable presentation, while the second layer verifies data authenticity and consistency using cryptographic signing. Lastly, the third layer guarantees data immutability through the Tangle, a directed acyclic graph distributed ledger. We implemented a proof-of-concept implementation of our solution to evaluate its performance, where the results demonstrate that the system scales linearly with a stable throughput, exhibits a 100% validation rate, and utilizes under 35% of CPU and 350 MiB memory. Compared to a real-world open banking implementation, our solution offers significantly reduced latency and stronger data integrity assurance. Overall, our solution offers a practical and efficient system for secure data sharing in financial ecosystems while maintaining regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a critical threat to classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC, particularly in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where secure communication is essential but often constrained by limited computational resources. This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms on resource-constrained devices. In particular, we implement three PQC algorithms -- BIKE, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and HQC -- on a lightweight IoT platform built with Raspberry Pi devices. Leveraging the Open Quantum Safe (\texttt{liboqs}) library in conjunction with \texttt{mbedTLS}, we develop quantum-secure key exchange protocols, and evaluate their performance in terms of computational overhead, memory usage, and energy consumption for quantum secure communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of PQC algorithms on constrained hardware is practical, reinforcing the urgent need for quantum-resilient cryptographic frameworks in next-generation IoT devices. The implementation of this paper is available at https://iqsec-lab.github.io/PQC-IoT/.</description>

      <title>Interpretability-Aware Pruning for Efficient Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>An Outlook on the Opportunities and Challenges of Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-agent AI system (MAS) is composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact, exchange information, and make decisions based on internal generative models. Recent advances in large language models and tool-using agents have made MAS increasingly practical in areas like scientific discovery and collaborative automation. However, key questions remain: When are MAS more effective than single-agent systems? What new safety risks arise from agent interactions? And how should we evaluate their reliability and structure? This paper outlines a formal framework for analyzing MAS, focusing on two core aspects: effectiveness and safety. We explore whether MAS truly improve robustness, adaptability, and performance, or merely repackage known techniques like ensemble learning. We also study how inter-agent dynamics may amplify or suppress system vulnerabilities. While MAS are relatively new to the signal processing community, we envision them as a powerful abstraction that extends classical tools like distributed estimation and sensor fusion to higher-level, policy-driven inference. Through experiments on data science automation, we highlight the potential of MAS to reshape how signal processing systems are designed and trusted.</description>

      <title>Experimental Ground-State Energy of a 125-Site Flat Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering on Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an instance of utility-grade quantum computation by calculating the ground-state energy of a 125-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our best per-site ground-state energy estimate arrives at -0.417J, and after applying open-boundary corrections, it closely approaches the established thermodynamic value of -0.438J. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that splits the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. We further introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining physical accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices.</description>
