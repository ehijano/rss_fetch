      <title>Pair Correlation of Zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function I: Proportions of Simple Zeros and Critical Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), Montgomery proved a theorem in 1973 concerning the pair correlation of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and applied this to prove that at least $2/3$ of the zeros are simple. In earlier work we showed how to remove RH from Montgomery's theorem and, in turn, obtain results on simple zeros assuming conditions on the zeros that are weaker than RH. Here we assume a more general condition, namely that all the zeros $\rho = \beta +i\gamma$ with $T&lt;\gamma\le 2T$ are in a narrow vertical box centered on the critical line with width $\frac{b}{\log T}$. For simplicity, now assume that $b\to 0$ as $T\to \infty$. Following Montgomery's method, we prove the generalization of Montgomery's result that at least $2/3$ of zeros are simple, and also the new result that at least $2/3$ of the zeros are on the critical line. We also use the pair correlation method to prove that at least $1/3$ of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line, a result already known unconditionally. Our work thus shows that the pair correlation method can be used to prove results not only on the vertical distribution of zeros but also on their horizontal distribution.</description>

      <title>The best two-term underapproximation using numbers from Fibonacci-type sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the greedy two-term underapproximation of $\theta\in (0,1]$ using reciprocals of numbers from a Fibonacci-type sequence $(c_n)_{n=1}^\infty$. We find the set of $\theta$ whose greedy two-term underapproximation is the best among all two-term underapproximations using $1/c_n$'s. We then derive a neat description of the set when $(c_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is the Fibonacci sequence or the Lucas sequence.</description>

      <title>Complexity of powers of a constant-recursive sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant-recursive sequences are those which satisfy a linear recurrence, so that later terms can be obtained as a linear combination of the previous ones. The rank of a constant-recursive sequence is the minimal number of previous terms required for such a recurrence. For a constant-recursive sequence $s(n)$, we study the sequence $\left(\text{rank}\, s(n)^M\right)_{M\geq 1}$. We answer a question of Stinchcombe regarding the complexity of the powers of a constant-recursive sequence when the roots of the characteristic polynomial are not all distinct.</description>

      <title>Normality of monodromy group in generic convolution group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On an abelian variety $A$, sheaf convolution gives a Tannakian formalism for perverse sheaves. Let $X$ be an irreducible algebraic variety with generic point $\eta$. Let $K$ be a family of perverse sheaves (more precisely, a relative perverse sheaf) on the constant abelian scheme $p_X:A\times X\to X$. We show that for uncountably many character sheaves $L_{\chi}$ on $A$, the monodromy groups of $R^0p_{X*}(K\otimes p_A^*L_{\chi})$ are normal in the Tannakian group $G(K|_{A_{\eta}})$ of the perverse sheaf $K|_{A_{\eta}}\in\mathrm{Perv}(A_{\eta})$.
  This result is inspired from and could be compared to two other normality results: In the same setting, the Tannakian group $G(K|_{A_{\bar{\eta}}})$ is normal in $G(K|_{A_{\eta}})$ (due to Lawrence-Sawin). For a polarizable variation of Hodge structures, outside a meager locus, the connected monodromy group is normal in the derived Mumford-Tate group (due to Andr\'e).</description>

      <title>Ceresa Cycles of $X_{0}(N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ceresa cycle is an algebraic 1-cycle on the Jacobian of an algebraic curve. Although it is homologically trivial, Ceresa famously proved that for a very general complex curve of genus at least 3, it is non-trivial in the Chow group. In this paper we study the Ceresa cycle attached to the complete modular curve $X_{0}(N)$. For prime level $p$ we give a complete description, namely we prove that if $X_{0}(p)$ is not hyperelliptic, then its Ceresa cycle is non-torsion. For general level $N$, we prove that there are finitely many $X_{0}(N)$ with torsion Ceresa cycle. Our method relies on the relationship between the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle and Chow-Heegner points on the Jacobian. We use the geometry and arithmetic of modular Jacobians to prove that such points are of infinite order and therefore deduce non-vanishing of the Ceresa cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mixed Weil cohomology with values in an abelian rigid tensor category is a cohomological functor on Voevodsky's category of motives which is satisfying K\"unneth formula and such that its restriction to Chow motives is a Weil cohomology. We show that the universal mixed Weil cohomology exists. Nori motives can be recovered as a universal enrichment of Betti cohomology via a localisation. This new picture is drawing some consequences with respect to the theory of mixed motives in arbitrary characteristic.</description>

      <title>Connection points on double regular polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study connection points on the double regular $n$-gon translation surface, for $n \geq 7$ odd and its staircase model. For $n \neq 9$, we provide a large family of points with coordinates in the trace field that are not connection points. This family includes the central points, and for $n=7$ we conjecture that all the remaining points are connection points. Further, in the case where $n \geq 7$ is a prime number, we provide a constructive proof by exhibiting an explicit separatrix passing through a central point that does not extend to a saddle connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.07370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss, in a non-Archimedean setting, the distribution of the coefficients of $L$-polynomials of curves of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Among other results, this allows us to prove that the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space spanned by such characteristic polynomials has dimension $g+1$. We also state a conjecture about the Archimedean distribution of the number of rational points of curves over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity obstructions in semigroup orbits in SL(2, Z)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study orbits of semigroups of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and demonstrate reciprocity obstructions: we show that certain such orbits avoid squares, but not as a consequence of obstructions inherited from an algebraic set, and not as a consequence of congruence obstructions. This is in analogy to the reciprocity obstructions recently used to disprove the Apollonian local-global conjecture. We give an example of such an orbit which is known exactly, and misses all squares together with an explicit finite list of sporadic values: the corresponding semigroup is not thin, but is dense in an algebraic variety that does not have such obstructions. We also demonstrate thin semigroups with reciprocity obstructions, including semigroups associated to continued fractions formed from finite alphabets. Zaremba's conjecture states that for continued fractions with coefficients chosen from $\{1,\ldots,5\}$, every positive integer appears as a denominator. Bourgain and Kontorovich proposed a generalization of Zaremba's conjecture in the context of semigroups associated to finite alphabets. We disprove their conjecture. In particular, we demonstrate classes of finite continued fraction expansions which never represent rationals with square denominator, but not as a consequence of congruence obstructions, and for which the limit set has Hausdorff dimension exceeding $1/2$. An example of such a class is continued fractions of the form $[0; a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n,1,1,2]$, where the $a_i$ are chosen from the set $\{4,8,12,\ldots,128\}$. The object at the heart of these results is a semigroup $\Psi\subseteq\Gamma_1(4)$ which preserves Kronecker symbols.</description>

Abstract: We prove a deformation theorem for prismatic higher $(G,\mu)$-displays over quasi-syntomic rings. As an application, we extend the classification of $p$-divisible groups via prismatic Dieudonn\'e modules to a class of rings properly containing quasi-syntonic rings. Finally, we related the stack of prismatic higher $(G,\mu)$-displays to integral local Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>
