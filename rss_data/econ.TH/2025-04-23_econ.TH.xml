      <title>Existence of Bayesian Equilibria in Incomplete Information Games without Common Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider incomplete information finite-player games where players may hold mutually inconsistent beliefs without a common prior. We introduce absolute continuity of beliefs, extending the classical notion of absolutely continuous information in Milgrom and Weber (1985), and prove that a Bayesian equilibrium exists under broad conditions. Applying these results to games with rich type spaces that accommodate infinite belief hierarchies, we show that when the analyst's game has a type space satisfying absolute continuity of beliefs, the actual game played according to the belief hierarchies induced by the type space has a Bayesian equilibrium for a wide class of games. We provide examples that illustrate practical applications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Bertrand Menu Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variation of the price competition model a la Bertrand, in which firms must offer menus of contracts that obey monotonicity constraints, e.g., wages that rise with worker productivity to comport with equal pay legislation. While such constraints limit firms' ability to undercut their competitors, we show that Bertrand's classic result still holds: competition drives firm profits to zero and leads to efficient allocations without rationing. Our findings suggest that Bertrand's logic extends to a broader variety of markets, including labor and product markets that are subject to real-world constraints on pricing across workers and products.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Equilibrium Selection: The Case of Generic Extensive Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solution concept that is a refinement of Nash equilibria selects for each finite game a nonempty collection of closed and connected subsets of Nash equilibria as solutions. We impose three axioms for such solution concepts. The axiom of backward induction requires each solution to contain a quasi-perfect equilibrium. Two invariance axioms posit that solutions of a game are the same as those of a game obtained by the addition of strategically irrelevant strategies and players. Stability satisfies these axioms; and any solution concept that satisfies them must, for generic extensive-form games, select from among its stable outcomes. A strengthening of the two invariance axioms provides an analogous axiomatization of components of equilibria with a nonzero index.</description>

      <title>Bounded arbitrage and nearly rational behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the equivalence between a principle of almost absence of arbitrage opportunities and nearly rational decision-making. The implications of such principle are considered in the context of the aggregation of probabilistic opinions and of stochastic choice functions. In the former a bounded arbitrage principle and its equivalent form as an approximately Pareto condition are shown to bound the difference between the collective probabilistic assessment of a set of states and a linear aggregation rule on the individual assessments. In the latter we show that our general principle of limited arbitrage opportunities translates into a weakening of the McFadden-Richter axiom of stochastic rationality, and gives an upper bound for the minimum distance of a stochastic choice function to another in the class of random utility maximization models.</description>

      <title>MAD Chairs: A new tool to evaluate AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes a new way to evaluate AI. Much as one might evaluate a machine in terms of its performance at chess, this approach involves evaluating a machine in terms of its performance at a game called "MAD Chairs". At the time of writing, evaluation with this game exposed opportunities to improve Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Qwen and DeepSeek. Furthermore, this paper sets a stage for future innovation in game theory and AI safety by providing an example of success with non-standard approaches to each: studying a game beyond the scope of previous game theoretic tools and mitigating a serious AI safety risk in a way that requires neither determination of values nor their enforcement.</description>
