      <title>Experiments \&amp; Analysis of Privacy-Preserving SQL Query Sanitization Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical SQL queries are essential for extracting insights from relational databases but concurrently introduce significant privacy risks by potentially exposing sensitive information. To mitigate these risks, numerous query sanitization systems have been developed, employing diverse approaches that create a complex landscape for both researchers and practitioners. These systems vary fundamentally in their design, including the underlying privacy model, such as k-anonymity or Differential Privacy; the protected privacy unit, whether at the tuple- or user-level; and the software architecture, which can be proxy-based or integrated. This paper provides a systematic classification of state-of-the-art SQL sanitization systems based on these qualitative criteria and the scope of queries they support. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of leading systems, empirically measuring the trade-offs between data utility, query execution overhead, and privacy guarantees across a range of analytical queries. This work offers a structured overview and performance assessment intended to clarify the capabilities and limitations of current privacy-preserving database technologies.</description>

      <title>The Past Still Matters: A Temporally-Valid Data Discovery System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the proliferation of public and enterprise data lakes has fueled intensive research into data discovery, aiming to identify the most relevant data from vast and complex corpora to support diverse user tasks. Significant progress has been made through the development of innovative index structures, similarity measures, and querying infrastructures. Despite these advances, a critical aspect remains overlooked: relevance is time-varying. Existing discovery methods largely ignore this temporal dimension, especially when explicit date/time metadata is missing. To fill this gap, we outline a vision for a data discovery system that incorporates the temporal dimension of data. Specifically, we define the problem of temporally-valid data discovery and argue that addressing it requires techniques for version discovery, temporal lineage inference, change log synthesis, and time-aware data discovery. We then present a system architecture to deliver these techniques, before we summarize research challenges and opportunities. As such, we lay the foundation for a new class of data discovery systems, transforming how we interact with evolving data lakes.</description>

      <title>Classifier-Augmented Generation for Structured Workflow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation (CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation, including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.</description>

      <title>MTSQL-R1: Towards Long-Horizon Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL via Agentic Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -&gt; verify -&gt; refine cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models, logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review to contribute to community research.</description>

      <title>Towards a Standard for JSON Document Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this technical report, we present a formalisation of the MongoDB aggregation framework. Our aim is to identify a fragment that could serve as the starting point for an industry-wide standard for querying JSON document databases. We provide a syntax and formal semantics for a set of selected operators, We show how this fragment relates to known relational query languages. We explain how our semantics differs from the current implementation of MongoDB, and justify our choices. We provide a set of algebraic transformations that can be used for query optimisation.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Uses of Regulatory Compliance Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10362v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organizations need to manage numerous business processes for delivering their services and products to customers. One important consideration thereby lies in the adherence to regulations such as laws, guidelines, or industry standards. In order to monitor adherence of their business processes to regulations -- in other words, their regulatory compliance -- organizations make use of various techniques that draw on process execution data of IT systems that support these processes. Previous research has investigated conformance checking, an operation of process mining, for the domains in which it is applied, its operationalization of regulations, the techniques being used, and the presentation of results produced. However, other techniques for regulatory compliance monitoring, which we summarize as compliance checking techniques, have not yet been investigated regarding these aspects in a structural manner. To this end, this work presents a systematic literature review on uses of regulatory compliance monitoring of business processes, thereby offering insights into the various techniques being used, their application and the results they generate. We highlight commonalities and differences between the approaches and find that various steps are performed manually; we also provide further impulses for research on compliance monitoring and its use in practice.</description>

      <title>PHast -- Perfect Hashing made fast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17918v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perfect hash functions give unique "names" to arbitrary keys requiring only a few bits per key. This is an essential building block in applications like static hash tables, databases, or bioinformatics. This paper introduces the PHast approach that combines the fastest available queries, very fast construction, and good space consumption (below 2 bits per key). PHast improves bucket-placement which first hashes each key k to a bucket, and then looks for the bucket seed s such that a placement function maps pairs (s,k) in a collision-free way. PHast can use small-range hash functions with linear mapping, fixed-width encoding of seeds, and parallel construction. This is achieved using small overlapping slices of allowed values and bumping to handle unsuccessful seed assignment. A variant we called PHast+ uses additive placement, which enables bit-parallel seed searching, speeding up the construction by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design, modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows, and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data (e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling), (iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding, programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g., data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.</description>
