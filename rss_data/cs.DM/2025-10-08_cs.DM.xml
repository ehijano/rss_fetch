      <title>Exact Causal Attention with 10% Fewer Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product $\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine learning and combinatorial search.</description>

      <title>Critical attention scaling in long-context transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$ effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large context lengths.</description>

      <title>M\"obius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Temporal Connected Components: Treewidth and k-Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of maximum temporal connected components (tccs) in temporal graphs, i.e., graphs that deterministically change over time. In a tcc, any pair of vertices must be able to reach each other via a time-respecting path. We consider both problems of maximum open tccs (openTCC), which allow temporal paths through vertices outside the component, and closed tccs (closedTCC) which require at least one temporal path entirely within the component for every pair. We focus on the structural parameter of treewidth, tw, and the recently introduced temporal parameter of temporal path number, tpn, which is the minimum number of paths needed to fully describe a temporal graph. We prove that these parameters on their own are not sufficient for fixed parameter tractability: both openTCC and closedTCC are NP-hard even when tw=9, and closedTCC is NP-hard when tpn=6. In contrast, we prove that openTCC is in XP when parameterized by tpn. On the positive side, we show that both problem become fixed parameter tractable under various combinations of structural and temporal parameters that include, tw plus tpn, tw plus the lifetime of the graph, and tw plus the maximum temporal degree.</description>

      <title>Weighted Food Webs Make Computing Phylogenetic Diversity So Much Harder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent certain species and their likely ancestors. In such a tree, present-day species are leaves and an edge from u to v indicates that u is an ancestor of v. Weights on these edges indicate the phylogenetic distance. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a set of species A is the total weight of edges that are on any path between the root of the phylogenetic tree and a species in A. Selecting a small set of species that maximizes phylogenetic diversity for a given phylogenetic tree is an essential task in preservation planning, where limited resources naturally prevent saving all species. An optimal solution can be found with a greedy algorithm [Steel, Systematic Biology, 2005; Pardi and Goldman, PLoS Genetics, 2005]. However, when a food web representing predator-prey relationships is given, finding a set of species that optimizes phylogenetic diversity subject to the condition that each saved species should be able to find food among the preserved species is NP-hard [Spillner et al., IEEE/ACM, 2008]. We present a generalization of this problem, where, inspired by biological considerations, the food web has weighted edges to represent the importance of predator-prey relationships. We show that this version is NP-hard even when both structures, the food web and the phylogenetic tree, are stars. To cope with this intractability, we proceed in two directions. Firstly, we study special cases where a species can only survive if a given fraction of its prey is preserved. Secondly, we analyze these problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. Our results include that finding a solution is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the vertex cover number of the food web, assuming the phylogenetic tree is a star.</description>

      <title>Improved Streaming Algorithm for Fair $k$-Center Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world applications pose challenges in incorporating fairness constraints into the $k$-center clustering problem, where the dataset consists of $m$ demographic groups, each with a specified upper bound on the number of centers to ensure fairness. Focusing on big data scenarios, this paper addresses the problem in a streaming setting, where data points arrive one by one sequentially in a continuous stream. Leveraging a structure called the $\lambda$-independent center set, we propose a one-pass streaming algorithm that first computes a reserved set of points during the streaming process. Then, for the post-streaming process, we propose an approach for selecting centers from the reserved point set by analyzing all three possible cases, transforming the most complicated one into a specially constrained vertex cover problem in an auxiliary graph. Our algorithm achieves a tight approximation ratio of 5 while consuming $O(k\log n)$ memory. It can also be readily adapted to solve the offline fair $k$-center problem, achieving a 3-approximation ratio that matches the current state of the art. Furthermore, we extend our approach to a semi-structured data stream, where data points from each group arrive in batches. In this setting, we present a 3-approximation algorithm for $m = 2$ and a 4-approximation algorithm for general $m$. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our approaches, demonstrating that they outperform existing baselines in both clustering cost and runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Finer View of the Parameterized Landscape of Labeled Graph Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} problem, where the input consists of two vertex-labeled graphs $G$ and $H$, and the goal is to determine whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ via a sequence of edge contractions.
  Lafond and Marchand~[WADS 2025] initiated the parameterized complexity study of this problem, showing it to be \(\W[1]\)-hard when parameterized by the number \(k\) of allowed contractions. They also proved that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the tree-width \(\tw\) of \(G\), via an application of Courcelle's theorem resulting in a non-constructive algorithm.
  In this work, we present a constructive fixed-parameter algorithm for \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with running time \(2^{\mathcal{O}(\tw^2)} \cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). We also prove that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (\ETH) fails, it does not admit an algorithm running in time \(2^{o(\tw^2)} \cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). This result adds \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} to a small list of problems that admit such a lower bound and matching algorithm.
  We further strengthen existing hardness results by showing that the problem remains \NP-complete even when both input graphs have bounded maximum degree. We also investigate parameterizations by \((k + \delta(G))\) where \(\delta(G)\) denotes the degeneracy of \(G\), and rule out the existence of subexponential-time algorithms. This answers question raised in Lafond and Marchand~[WADS 2025]. We additionally provide an improved \FPT\ algorithm with better dependence on \((k + \delta(G))\) than previously known. Finally, we analyze a brute-force algorithm for \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with running time \(|V(H)|^{\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|)}\), and show that this running time is optimal under \ETH.</description>

      <title>On classes of bounded tree rank, their interpretations, and efficient sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph classes of bounded tree rank were introduced recently in the context of the model checking problem for first-order logic of graphs. These graph classes are a common generalization of graph classes of bounded degree and bounded treedepth, and they are a special case of graph classes of bounded expansion. We introduce a notion of decomposition for these classes and show that these decompositions can be efficiently computed. Also, a natural extension of our decomposition leads to a new characterization and decomposition for graph classes of bounded expansion (and an efficient algorithm computing this decomposition).
  We then focus on interpretations of graph classes of bounded tree rank. We give a characterization of graph classes interpretable in graph classes of tree rank $2$. Importantly, our characterization leads to an efficient sparsification procedure: For any graph class $C$ interpretable in a efficiently bounded graph class of tree rank at most $2$, there is a polynomial time algorithm that to any $G \in C$ computes a (sparse) graph $H$ from a fixed graph class of tree rank at most $2$ such that $G = I(H)$ for a fixed interpretation $I$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient "interpretation reversal" result that generalizes the result of Gajarsk\'y et al. [LICS 2016], who showed an analogous result for graph classes interpretable in classes of graphs of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds on Multiflow-Multicut Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of source-sink pairs, the maximum multiflow problem asks for the maximum total amount of flow that can be feasibly routed between them. The minimum multicut, a dual problem to multiflow, seeks the minimum-cost set of edges whose removal disconnects all the source-sink pairs. It is easy to see that the value of the minimum multicut is at least that of the maximum multiflow, and their ratio is called the multiflow-multicut gap. The classical max-flow min-cut theorem states that when there is only one source-sink pair, the gap is exactly one. However, in general, it is well known that this gap can be arbitrarily large. In this paper, we study this gap for classes of planar graphs and establish improved lower bound results. In particular, we show that this gap is at least $\frac{16}{7}$ for the class of planar graphs, improving upon the decades-old lower bound of 2. More importantly, we develop new techniques for proving such a lower bound, which may be useful in other settings as well.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

Abstract: In this note we show that there is a cubic graph of girth $5$ that is not a subgraph of any minimal Cayley graph. On the other hand, we show that any Generalized Petersen Graph $G(n,k)$ with $\gcd(n,k)=1$ is an induced subgraph of a minimal Cayley graph. These results give insights into two comments of L\'aszl\'o Babai in [L. Babai, \emph{Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction}. Graham, R. L. (ed.) et al., Handbook of combinatorics.

      <title>The Local Structure Theorem for Graph Minors with Finite Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Local Structure Theorem (LST) for graph minors roughly states that every $H$-minor free graph $G$ that contains a sufficiently large wall $W$, there is a set of few vertices $A$ such that, upon removing $A$, the resulting graph $G':=G - A$ admits an "almost embedding" $\delta$ into a surface $\Sigma$ in which $H$ does not embed. By almost embedding, we mean that there exists a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ whose vertex set is a subset of the vertex set of $G$ and an embedding of $\mathcal{H}$ in $\Sigma$ such that 1) the drawing of each hyperedge of $\mathcal{H}$ corresponds to a cell of $\delta$, 2) the boundary of each cell intersects only the vertices of the corresponding hyperedge, and 3) all remaining vertices and edges of $G'$ are drawn in the interior of cells. The cells corresponding to hyperedges of arity at least $4$, called vortices, are few in number and have small "depth", while a "large" part of the wall $W$ is drawn outside the vortices and is "grounded" in the embedding $\delta$. Now suppose that the subgraphs drawn inside each of the non-vortex cells are equipped with some finite index, i.e., each such cell is assigned a color from a finite set. We prove a version of the LST in which the set $C$ of colors assigned to the non-vortex cells exhibits "large" bidimensionality: The graph $G'$ contains a minor model of a large grid $\Gamma$ where each bag corresponding to a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, contains the subgraph drawn within a cell carrying color $\alpha$, for every color $\alpha \in C$. Moreover, the grid $\Gamma$ can be chosen in a way that is "well-connected" to the original wall $W$.</description>

      <title>A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific "trigger" arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps of 0.77% and 0.40% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced solutions 11.3% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints. The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel costs.</description>
