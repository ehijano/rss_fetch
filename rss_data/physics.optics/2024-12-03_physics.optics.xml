      <title>Rapid Trapping and Label-free Characterization of Single Nanoscale Extracellular Vesicles and Nanoparticles in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-throughput, comprehensive analysis of single nanoparticles to determine their size, shape, and composition is essential for understanding particle heterogeneity with applications ranging from drug delivery to environmental monitoring. Existing techniques are hindered by low throughput, lengthy trapping times, irreversible particle adsorption, or limited characterization capabilities. Here, we introduce Interferometric Electrohydrodynamic Tweezers (IET), an integrated platform that rapidly traps single nanoparticles in parallel within three seconds. IET enables label-free characterization of particle size and shape via interferometric imaging and identifies molecular composition through Raman spectroscopy, all without the need for fluorescent labeling. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by trapping and imaging colloidal polymer beads, nanoscale extracellular vesicles (EVs), and newly discovered extracellular nanoparticles known as supermeres. By monitoring their interferometric contrast images while trapped, we accurately determine the sizes of EVs and supermeres. Our IET represents a powerful optofluidics platform for comprehensive characterization of nanoscale objects, opening new avenues in nanomedicine, environmental monitoring, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Micro-cavity length stabilization for fluorescence enhancement using schemes based on higher order spatial modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on experimental investigation of potential high-performance cavity length stabilization using odd-indexed higher-order spatial modes. Schemes based on higher-order modes are particularly useful for micro-cavities that are used for enhanced fluorescence detection of a few emitters, which need to minimize photons leaking from a stabilization beam. We describe the design and construction of an assembly for a microcavity setup with tunable high passive stability. In addition, different types of active stabilization techniques based on higher-order modes, are then implemented and characterized based on their performance. We achieved a stability of about 0.5 pm RMS, while the error photons leaking from the continuous locking beam to a fluorescence detector are suppressed by more than 100-fold. We expect these results to be important for quantum technology implementations of various emitter-cavity setups, where these techniques provide a useful tool to meet the highly challenging demands.</description>

      <title>Shaping terahertz harmonic frequency combs with frequency dependent external reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for engineering harmonic frequency combs (HFCs) in the terahertz spectral region. This approach involves interfacing a quantum cascade laser (QCL) with an external reflector featuring frequency-dependent reflectivity. A notable advantage of this method over existing ones is its dual functionality in shaping HFCs, allowing for control over both the frequency offset and comb spacing based on the external reflectivity profile. Moreover, the resulting HFCs manifest as sequences of short pulses in the time domain. Consequently, our method enables the generation of ultrashort picosecond pulses passively, providing a distinct alternative to conventional pulse generation systems reliant on active bias current modulation, which struggle with modulation frequencies significantly higher than the first beatnote. This offers intriguing prospects for utilizing HFCs in pump and probe spectroscopy, a field already recognized in the literature as one of the most compelling applications of these states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these HFCs can be triggered from an initial condition of free-running unlocked dynamics, eliminating the need for assuming free-running comb emission. Thus, the utilization of an external, frequency-dependent reflector is capable of enhancing the coherence of the QCL emission.</description>

      <title>Nearfield Vortex Dynamics of Supercell Bloch Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Densely arranged optical vortices are natural solutions of high-symmetry Bloch modes in photonic crystals. However, strict symmetry constraints limit the potential spatial configurations of nearfield vortices, restricting the control over light-matter interaction. Here, we demonstrate a nearfield vortex dynamic within a supercell photonic crystal. By introducing paired rotations of triangular structures, we achieve high-quality-factor Bloch mode transition from evanescent valley modes, to quasi-bound states in the continuum, frustrated modes, and quasi-valleys. Each stage exhibits distinct nearfield vortex distributions, nonlinear overlap properties, and quality factors, revealing diverse physical behaviors for tailoring light-matter interaction. Notably, the asymmetric vortex configuration of frustrated modes enhances second harmonic generation, driven by an optimized nonlinear overlap factor. Our paired-rotation strategy offers a versatile design framework for creating supercell photonic crystals with unique nearfield vortex properties, presenting promising applications in lasing, nonlinear optics and optical forces.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts, and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</description>

      <title>A negative index metamaterial driven by phonons on a ZnO platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative index metamaterials (NIMs) can be achieved with uniaxial hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) featuring $\epsilon_{parallel}&gt;0$ and $\epsilon_{perpendicular}&lt;0$. This type of approach has been traditionally realized using stacked doped/undoped semiconductor layers. Only recently surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising low-loss alternative to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Despite this advantage, the SPhP-based approach has been underexplored due to the challenges associated with ensuring high crystal quality in the heterostructure when using alloys with different phonon frequencies. In this work, we design a phononic-driven NIM using a ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O heterostructure, demonstrating control over its hyperbolic behavior through the precise selection of the Mg content and the relative layer thicknesses. Our study shows that increasing the Mg content in the ternary layers enhances the type I behavior, and that the optimal layer thickness varies depending on the Mg content. After analyzing the conditions for achieving type I hyperbolic dispersion, we experimentally demonstrate this concept with a sample featuring equal layer thicknesses and a 32% Mg concentration. We characterize the structure by means of polarized reflectance spectroscopy and use attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy to report the presence of a SPhP mode located within the type I hyperbolic region. By employing the transfer matrix method, we demonstrate that this mode exhibits negative frequency dispersion, a hallmark of type I hyperbolic modes, and isofrequency curve calculations further confirm this behavior. Controlling the design of a phononic hyperbolic type I metamaterial lays the groundwork for exploring its potential applications in attaining low-loss, sub-diffraction-limited optical modes using SPhP excitations.</description>

      <title>Perceived brightness and resolution of holographic augmented reality retinal scan glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented reality display performance depends strongly on features of the human visual system. This is especially true for retinal scan glasses, which use laser beam scanning and transparent holographic optical combiners. Human-centered approaches allow us to go beyond conventional optical metrology and evaluate display performance as it is perceived in actual augmented reality use cases. Here, we first present a theoretical formula for the retinal scan luminance and ambient contrast ratio calculated from optical powers, wavelengths, field of view, and human pupil diameter. As a promising insight we found that the pupil diameter dependence is beneficial in assimilating the virtual image luminance to the ambient luminance. Second, we designed and performed a psychophysical experiment to assess perceived resolution in augmented reality settings using a fully functional retinal scan glasses prototype. We present the results of the trials and illustrate how this approach can be useful in the further development of augmented reality smart glasses.</description>

      <title>Brownian spin-locking effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian systems are characterized by spatiotemporal disorder, which arises from the erratic motion of particles driven by thermal fluctuations. When light interacts with such systems, it typically produces unpolarized and uncorrelated fields. Here, we report the observation of a large-scale spin-locking effect of light within a Brownian medium. In an observation direction perpendicular to the incident wave momentum, scattering naturally divides into two diffusion regions, each associated with an opposite spin from the Brownian nanoparticles. This effect arises from the intrinsic spin-orbit interactions of scattering from individual nanoparticles, which ubiquitously generate radiative spin fields that propagate through the Brownian medium with multiple incoherent scattering. It offers a novel experimental platform for exploring macroscale spin behaviors of diffused light, with potential applications in precision metrology for measuring various nanoparticle properties. Our findings may inspire the study of analogous phenomena for different waves from novel spin-orbit interactions in complex disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Q factor and robustness of photonic bound state in the continuum merging at locally bent trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) in planar photonic structures have attracted broad scientific interest owing to their exceptional capability to confine light. Topological robustness of certain BICs allows them to be moved in the momentum space by tuning the geometric parameters of the structure. In this work, we study such a BIC in a one-dimensional periodic grating, and find that its momentum-space position can be made a non-monotonic function of a geometric parameter, forming a locally bent ''V''-shaped trajectory. We show that, near the turning point of this trajectory, the robustness of the BIC and its $Q$ factor can be greatly enhanced. We tune such ''V-BICs'' to almost merge with a symmetry-protected BIC at the $\Gamma$-point. This creates a ''K''-shaped ultrahigh-$Q$ region containing a BIC with a much higher and more stable $Q$ factor compared to the ordinary merging BICs. The ''K-BICs'' are also found to provide a strong enhancement of the $Q$ factor in finite gratings over an extremely wide range of geometric parameters. Our findings enable further advancements in the development of ultrahigh-$Q$ BICs and their applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient, ultra-high attenuation fiber Bragg grating filter for photon noise suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision optical filters are key components for current and future photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a low loss spectral filter consisting of an ultrasteep bandpass feature with a maximum gradient of (90.6$\pm$0.7) dB/GHz, centred within a notch filter with (128$\pm$6) dB of suppression. The filter consists of a fiber Bragg grating with multiple $\pi$-phase discontinuities inscribed into a single mode photosensitive fiber. The measured performance closely matches the simulated spectrum calculated from the design parameters indicating a high degree of confidence in the repeatability and manufacture of such devices. These filters show great promise for applications reliant on high-frequency resolution noise suppression, such as quantum networking, and highlight the opportunities for the versatility, efficiency, and extreme suppression offered by high-performance fiber Bragg grating devices.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Optical and Thermal Responses: Thermo-optical Nonlinearities Unlock MHz Transmission Modulation in Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermo-optical nonlinearities (TONL) in metasurfaces enable dynamic control of optical properties like transmission, reflection, and absorption through external stimuli such as laser irradiation or temperature. As slow thermal dynamics of extended systems are expected to limit modulation speeds ultimately, research has primarily focused on steady-state effects. In this study, we investigate photo-driven TONL in amorphous silicon (a-Si) metasurfaces both under steady-state and, most importantly, dynamic conditions (50 kHz modulation) using a 488 nm continuous-wave pump laser. First, we show that a non-monotonic change in the steady-state transmission occurs at wavelengths longer than the electric-dipole resonance (800 nm). In particular, at 815 nm transmission first decreases by 30% and then increases by 30% as the laser intensity is raised to 5 mW/{\mu}m2. Next, we demonstrate that TONL decouple the thermal and optical characteristic times, the latter being up to 7 times shorter in the tested conditions (i.e {\tau}opt =0.5 {\mu}s vs {\tau}th =3.5 {\mu}s). Most remarkably, we experimentally demonstrate that combining these two effects enables optical modulation at twice the speed (100 kHz) of the excitation laser modulation. We finally show how to achieve all-optical transmission modulation at MHz speeds with large amplitudes (85%). Overall, these results show that photo-driven TONL produce large and fully reversible transmission modulation in dielectric metasurfaces with fast and adjustable speeds. Therefore, they open completely new opportunities toward exploiting TONL in dynamically reconfigurable systems, from optical switching to wavefront manipulation.</description>

      <title>Vertical Emission of Blue Light from a Symmetry Breaking Plasmonic Nanocavity-Emitter System Supporting Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs), introduced in structured metallic surface cavities, provides a crucial mechanism for designing plasmonic open-resonant cavities with high quality (high-Q) factors, making significant advances in plasmonic nanophotonics. However, the two major bottlenecks for plasmonic nanocavities: enhancing emission and big beam divergence for quantum emitters, due to the strong intrinsic Ohmic losses of metals. Here, we propose and realize a {\sigma}h symmetry-breaking plasmonic honeycomb nanocavities (PHC) that support quasi-BIC resonance modes with high-Q factors. Our anodic oxidation-engineered strategy breaks out-of-plane symmetry while preserving in-plane symmetry, enabling the PHC to exhibit collective plasmonic lattice resonances (PLR) couplings and achieve Q-factors exceeding 106. Experimentally, we couple perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) to the PHC, demonstrating effective tuning of their emission properties and beam quality in the blue spectral region, achieving a 32-fold emission enhancement by suppress Ohmic loss and the life time of quantum emitters, simultaneously realize vertical emission in the 2.556 - 2.638 eV region, with a far-field hexagonal beam shape and a full width at half maximum of 12.6 degree under optimal coupling conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate topological band inversion characterized by Zak phase transitions by continuously tuning the system parameters, confirming that the PHC supports topologically non-trivial q-BIC due to PLR coupling. The PHC presents itself as a promising next-generation, high-brightness nanoscale light source matrix, which can be directly scaled up to cover a wide wavelength range from UV to IR.</description>

      <title>Prediction and observation of topological modes in fractal nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This item from the News &amp; Views category, to be published in Light: Science &amp; Applications, aims to provide a summary of theoretical and experimental results recently published in Ref. [24], which demonstrate the creation of corner modes in nonlinear optical waveguides of the higher-order topological-insulator (HOTI) type. Actually, these are second-order HOTIs, in which the transverse dimension of the topologically protected edge modes is smaller than the bulk dimension (it is 2, in the case of optical waveguide) by 2, implying zero dimension of the protected modes, that are actually realized as corner or defect ones. Work [24] reports prediction and creation of various forms of the corner modes in a HOTI with a fractal transverse structure, represented by the Sierpinski gasket (SG). The self-focusing nonlinearity of the waveguide's material transforms the corner modes into corner solitons, almost all of which are stable. The solitons may be attached to external or internal corners created by the underlying SG. This N&amp;V item offers an overview of these new findings reported in Ref. [24] and other recent works, and a brief discussion of directions for the further work on this topic.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic waves to monitor active THz metagrating based on VO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a new approach to in-situ monitor the altered states of pixels in VO2 based active THz amplitude metagrating by using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated in LiNbO3 substrate. A single broadband RF response of the SAW device consists of N narrowband frequency channels which code the feedback information on the current pixels states. This way the resistance alteration due to metal-to-insulator transition of all VO2 based pixels of the active THz grating is monitored in advance even without incident radiation. The method provides important new options of monitoring a metasurface aging as well as incorrect switching related to technological defects. Using of the SAW device in all-electrically addressed VO2 based binary grating with tunable period as well as advanced gradient type gratings are modeled.</description>

      <title>Confinement Specific Design of SOI Rib Waveguides with Submicron Dimensions and Single Mode Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-vectorial finite difference method with perfectly matched layers boundaries is used to identify the single mode operation region of submicron rib waveguides fabricated using sili-con-on-insulator material system. Achieving high mode power confinement factors is emphasized while maintaining the single mode operation. As opposed to the case of large cross-section rib waveguides, theoretical single mode conditions have been demonstrated to hold for sub-micron waveguides with accuracy approaching 100%. Both, the deeply and the shallowly etched rib waveguides have been considered and the single mode condition for entire sub-micrometer range is presented while adhering to design specific mode confinement requirements.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of slowlingly varying envelope in finite element electromagnetism: a ray-wave method of modeling multi-scale devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose an efficient and accurate multi-scale optical simulation algorithm by applying a numerical version of slowly varying envelope approximation in FEM. Specifically, we employ the fast iterative method to quickly compute the phase distribution of the electric field within the computational domain and construct a novel multi-scale basis function that combines the conventional polynomial basis function together with numerically resolved phase information of optical waves. Utilizing this multi-scale basis function, the finite element method can significantly reduce the degrees of freedom required for the solution while maintaining computational accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency. Without loss of generality, we illustrate our approach via simulating the examples of lens groups and gradient-index lenses, accompanied with performance benchmark against the standard finite element method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent results with the standard finite element method but with a computational speed improved by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Full 3D Model of Modulation Efficiency of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Compatible, Submicron, Interleaved Junction Optical Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance optimization associated with optical modulators requires reasonably accurate predictive models for key figures of merit. Interleaved PN-junction topology offers the maximum mode/junction overlap and is the most efficient modulator in depletion-mode of operation. Due to its structure, the accurate modelling process must be fully three-dimensional, which is a nontrivial computational problem. This paper presents a rigorous 3D model for the modulation efficiency of silicon-on-insulator interleaved junction optical phase modulators with submicron dimensions. Solution of Drift-Diffusion and Poisson equations were carried out on 3D finite-element-mesh and Maxwell equations were solved using Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) method on 3D Yee-cells. Whole of the modelling process has been detailed and all the coefficients required in the model are presented. Model validation suggests &lt; 10% RMS error.</description>

      <title>Photon transport through the entire adult human head</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical brain imaging technologies are promising due to their relatively high temporal resolution, portability and cost-effectiveness. However, the highly scattering nature of near-infrared light in human tissue makes it challenging to collect photons emerging from more than 4 cm below the scalp, or with source-detector separation larger than several centimeters. We explore the physical limits of photon transport in the head and show that despite an extreme attenuation of ~10^(18), we can experimentally detect light that is transmitted diametrically through the entire adult human head. Analysis of various photon migration pathways through the head also indicates how the source-detector configuration can be used to isolate photons interacting with deep regions of the brain that are inaccessible with current optical techniques.</description>

      <title>Higly efficient, tunable, electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast and highly efficient dynamic optical metasurfaces enabling truly spatiotemporal control over optical radiation are poised to revolutionize modern optics and photonics, but their practical realization remains elusive. In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) operating in reflection that are amenable for ultrafast operation and thereby spatiotemporal control over reflected optical fields. The material configuration consists of a lithium niobate thin film sandwiched between an optically thick gold back-reflector and a grating of gold nanoridges also functioning as control electrodes. Metasurfaces for optical free-space intensity modulation are designed by utilizing the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with an ultra-narrow qBIC resonance, whose wavelength can be finely tuned by varying the angle of light incidence. The fabricated electro-optic metasurfaces operate at telecom wavelengths with the modulation depth reaching 95 % (modulating thereby 35 % of the total incident power) for a bias voltage of +/-30 V within the electrical bandwidth of 125 MHz. Leveraging the highly angle-dependent qBIC resonance realized, we demonstrate electrically tunable phase contrast imaging using the fabricated metasurface. Moreover, given the potential bandwidth of 39 GHz estimated for the metasurface pixel size of 22 $\mu$m, the demonstrated electro-optic metasurfaces promise successful realization of unique optical functions, such as harmonic beam steering and spatiotemporal shaping as well as nonreciprocal operation.</description>

      <title>Optical excitation of bulk plasmons in n-doped InAsSb thin films : investigating the second viscosity in electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.</description>

      <title>Condensation dynamics in a two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton condensation occurs at the extrema of the underlying dispersion where the density of states diverges and carriers can naturally accumulate. The existence of multiple such points leads to coupling and competition between the associated modes and dynamical redistribution of the carriers in the dispersion. Here, we directly engineer the above situation via subwavelength periodic patterning of a two-dimensional nanostructure. This leads to multimode condensation into a pair of symmetric condensates that form at high-momenta, accidental-coupling points, and a high-symmetry $\Gamma$-point with a bound-in-the-continuum (BiC) state. The dynamical behaviour of the system reveals the non-simultaneous appearance of these condensates and the interplay of non-trivial gain and relaxation mechanisms. We fully characterise the quasi-static and dynamical regime of this artificial crystal and the properties of the different condensates. This understanding is necessary when band-structure engineering techniques are used to achieve precise control of condensate formation with given energy and momentum.</description>

      <title>Fano resonance in XUV generated by helium with few-cycle intense laser pulses and its classical analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We integrate numerically the Schr\"odinger equation for the model helium atom irradiated by intense few-cycle laser pulse and find the emitted XUV spectra. They demonstrate resonant peaks at the frequencies of transitions from the doubly-excited autoionizing states (AISs) to the ground state. We study the properties of these peaks depending on the laser pulse duration and find that the decay of the AISs due to photoionization by the laser field affects them. Moreover, we consider the classical system of two coupled oscillators and find that both the quantum (the atom with AIS in the field) and the classical (the coupled oscillators with friction) systems demonstrate Fano-like resonant peak described by an essentially complex asymmetry parameter. We find a remarkable similarity in the behavior of these systems and conclude that the classical system of coupled oscillators with friction is an analogy of the AIS having an extra decay channel in addition to the autoionization one.</description>

      <title>Local Avalanche Photodetectors Driven by Lightning-rod Effect and Surface Plasmon Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitive avalanche photodetectors (APDs) that operate within the ultraviolet spectrum are critically required for applications in detecting fire and deep-space exploration. However, the development of such devices faces significant challenges, including high avalanche breakdown voltage, the necessity for complex quenching circuits, and thermal runaway associated with Geiger-mode avalanche operation. To mitigate these issues, we report on a 4H-SiC APD design utilizing micro-holes (MHs) structures and Al nano-triangles (NTs) to enhance surface electric field driven by strong localized surface plasmon excitations and lightning-rod effect. The device demonstrates a record low avalanche breakdown voltage of approximately 14.5 V, a high detectivity of 7E13 Jones, a nanosecond-level response time, and repeated stable detections without the requirement of a quenching circuit. Collectively, when compared with the conventional wide-bandgap-based APDs, this device achieves a reduction in avalanche breakdown voltage by an order of magnitude and exhibits a substantial increase in detectivity. Consequently, the proposed APD configuration presents a promising candidate for ultraviolet detection and integrated optoelectronic circuits.</description>

      <title>Extreme-ultraviolet spatiotemporal vortices via high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV) are space-time structured light pulses with a unique topology that couples spatial and temporal domains and carry transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Up to now, their generation has been limited to the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum. During the last decade, it was shown that through the process of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) it is possible to up-convert spatial optical vortices that carry longitudinal OAM from the near-infrared into the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), thereby producing vortices with distinct femtosecond and attosecond structure. In this work we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally the generation of EUV spatiotemporal and spatiospectral vortices using near infrared STOV driving laser pulses. We use analytical expressions for focused STOVs to perform macroscopic calculations of HHG that are directly compared to the experimental results. As STOV beams are not eigenmodes of propagation, we characterize the highly-charged EUV STOVs both in the near and far fields, to show that they represent conjugated spatiotemporal and spatiospectral vortex pairs. Our work provides high-frequency light beams topologically coupled at the nanometer/attosecond scales domains with transverse OAM, that could be suitable to explore electronic dynamics in magnetic materials, chiral media, and nanostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thulium-doped fiber laser operating quasi-continuous-wave generated 198 W of instantaneous output power in 0.2-ms pulses at 50 Hz repetition rate. The duty cycle becomes 1% and the average output power 2.0 W. This was cladding-pumped with 408 W from 0.79-um diode lasers (average pump power 4.1 W). The pump switch-on time was ~10 us at full power, with the laser exhibiting relaxation oscillations starting ~5 us after the start of the pumping and lasting for ~5 us. The slope efficiency with respect to absorbed pump power was 67% up to 200 W of absorbed pump power and 52% at the full 352 W of absorbed pump power. The low duty cycle simplified the heatsinking, despite the high instantaneous power and thermal load.</description>

      <title>On the transfer of the angular momentum of a structured laser pulse to an ensemble of charged particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A structure of a laser pulse may significantly influence the dynamics of interacting particles. In the case of dilute plasma the particle dynamics may be considered in the single particle approximation. In this paper the problem of the angular momentum gain of a single particle in a focused structured pulse is considered for some certain cases, including radial and azimuthal polarizations, in the frameworks of the theoretical model, presented in [E. Dmitriev and Ph. Korneev, 'Angular momentum gain by electrons under the action of intense structured light', Physical Review A, vol. 110, p. 013514, (2024)], which includes solving of Maxwell's equations with a required accuracy and the high order perturbation theory. The obtained analytical results are compared to the results of numerical simulations. Angular dependence in the structure of the laser pulse is shown to be critically important for the orbital angular momentum gain of an ensemble of charged particles in a structured wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects leading to generation of quasi-stationary and propagating electromagnetic fields during the propagation of a laser-driven current discharge pulse in extended targets are considered. The results of numerical modeling describe the interaction of a relativistically intense ultrashort laser pulse with an extended dense target and its transformation into a powerful discharge current pulse. It is shown that under certain conditions such a pulse can be used to generate strong electromagnetic fields with certain spatio-temporal properties. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the discharge pulse parameters on the properties of the induced electromagnetic fields. Analysis of the discharge current profile in dependence on the target thickness is provided and the dynamics of discharge current pulse profile evolution is studied on the time scale $\sim 10$ ps, when the propagation distance is $\sim 3$ mm.</description>

Abstract: Bilayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides show many exciting features, including long-lived interlayer excitons and wide bandgap tunability using strain. Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interactions in layered materials and heterostructures: from moir\'e physics and magneto-optical effects to ultrafast dynamics and hybrid meta-photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials have revolutionized how we approach light-matter interactions, offering unprecedented optical and electronic properties with the potential for vertical heterostructures and manipulation of spin-valley degrees of freedom. The discovery of moir\'e physics in twisted heterostructures has further unlocked new possibilities for controlling the band structure of tailored semiconductor heterostructures. In parallel, the integration of 2D materials with hybrid photonic structures and ultrafast studies on their optical and spin-valley properties has revealed a wealth of novel physical phenomena. This perspective highlights the recent advances in our understanding of light-matter interactions in moir\'e and 2D systems, with a particular emphasis on ultrafast processes and the integration of these materials into photonic platforms. We explore the implications for optoelectronics and emerging photonic technologies, positioning 2D materials as a transformative tool for next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive type of wave propagation, due to the intricate interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder. Here, we investigate the spreading dynamics in the archetypal non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model with quasiperiodic disorder. We uncover counter-intuitive transport behaviors: subdiffusion with a spreading exponent $\delta=1/3$ in the localized regime and diffusion with $\delta=1/2$ in the delocalized regime, in stark contrast to their Hermitian counterparts (halted vs. ballistic). We then establish a unified framework from random-variable perspective to determine the universal scaling relations in both regimes for generic disordered non-Hermitian systems. An efficient method is presented to extract the spreading exponents from Lyapunov exponents. The observed subdiffusive or diffusive transport in our model stems from Van Hove singularities at the tail of imaginary density of states, as corroborated by Lyapunov-exponent analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their quantum nature, single-photon emitters generate individual photons in bursts or streams. They are paramount in emerging quantum technologies such as quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and measurement-based quantum computing. Many such systems have been reported in the last three decades, from Rubidium atoms coupled to cavities to semiconductor quantum dots and color centers implanted in waveguides. This review article highlights different material systems with deterministic and controlled single photon generation. We discuss and compare the performance metrics, such as purity and indistinguishability, for these sources and evaluate their potential for different applications. Finally, a new potential single-photon source, based on the Rydberg exciton in solid state metal oxide thin films, is introduced, briefly discussing its promising qualities and advantages in fabricating quantum chips for quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>A Light-Emitting-Diodes-Integrated Silicon Carbide Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A light-emitting-diodes (LEDs)-integrated silicon carbide (SiC) insulated gate bipolar transistors (LI-IGBT) is proposed in this paper. The novelty of the LI-IGBT depends on the photogeneration effect of III-nitride LEDs embedded in the poly-Si regions of IGBT. Then, the photogenerated carriers are formed in the JFET region and the drift layer, indicating the increase of the conductivity in LI-IGBT as compared with the SiC IGBT with hole-barrier layer (H-IGBT) and the SiC IGBT with charge storage layer (CSL-IGBT). The static simulation results show that the electron density of the LI-IGBT at the middle of the drift layer is separately 17.44 times and 15.81 times higher than those of the H-IGBT and CSL-IGBT, yielding 40.91% and 37.38% reduction of forward voltage drop, respectively, and also, the LI-IGBT shows 304.59% and 263.67% improvements in BFOM as compared with CSL-IGBT and H-IGBT, respectively. For the dynamic simulation in one cycle, the loss of LI-IGBT is separately reduced by 6.57% and 8.57% compared to H-IGBT and CSL-IGBT. Meanwhile, the relationship between VC(sat) and Eturn-off can be optimized by adjusting collector doping and minority carrier lifetime. These results reveal that the proposed SiC IGBT will be more suitable for ultra-high voltage application.</description>

      <title>Coherent emission from single impurities in ZnSe through resonant excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubit systems. Previous work relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons from these impurities. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving to directly excite optical transitions and maintain coherence. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. We observe resonance fluorescence and verify the emission coherence through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation also enables the direct measurement of the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, indicating high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically driven ionization process attributed to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We demonstrate that a low-power incoherent pump laser efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns. Our results pave the way for direct coherent optical and spin control through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Inverse Design of Hyperuniform Optical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse design of finite-size photonic materials with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs can capture the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inversely retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we numerically corroborate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. The flexible multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of more general effective media and finite-size optical metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>The optical generation and continuous transformation of plasmonic skyrmions</title>

Abstract: Topological quasiparticles, including skyrmions and merons, are topological textures with sophisticated vectorial structures that can be used for high-density information storage, precision metrology, position sensing, etc. Here, we realized the optical generation and continuous transformation of plasmonic field skyrmions. We generated the isolated N\'eel-type skyrmion using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excited by a focused structured light on a silver film. We used a square and a hexagonal aperture for symmetry constraints and successfully generated the meron lattice and the skyrmion lattice. We unveiled the mechanism of topological texture generation and transformation and optimized the distribution of skyrmion and meron topologies. We further demonstrated the continuous transformation among the isolated skyrmion, the meron lattice, and the skyrmion lattice using well-designed circular-fourfold, circular-sixfold, and fourfold-sixfold symmetry apertures, respectively. This work can open up a pathway for the generation and transformation of skyrmion and meron topologies, which is expected to facilitate new applications in optical information storage and encoding.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the enhanced photonic spin Hall effect in a subwavelength grating supporting surface plasmon resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) structures has great potential for various polarization-sensitive applications and devices. Here, using optical weak measurement, we observe spin-dependent and spin-independent angular shifts of the reflected beam, enhanced by SPR in a subwavelength nickel grating. An enhanced in-plane photonic spin Hall effect manifested in the angular splitting of circularly polarized photons with opposite helicity signs is demonstrated. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that angular in-plane shifts can be changed from spin-independent (Goos-H\"anchen shift) to spin-dependent (PSHE) when the incident beam polarization state changes. The SPR-induced depolarization of light and the mixing of polarization states are detected. High purity of spin separation and a high degree of circular polarization are achieved with an optimal polarization state (preselection angle) and a resonance angle of incidence. The spineless spatial separation of two orthogonal components of the field with diagonal linear polarizations is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Universal on-chip polarization handling with deep photonic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel design paradigm for arbitrarily capable deep photonic networks of cascaded Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) for on-chip universal polarization handling. Using a device architecture made of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we modify and train the phase difference between interferometer arms for both polarizations through wide operation bandwidths. Three proof-of-concept polarization handling devices are illustrated using a software-defined, physics-informed neural framework, to achieve user-specified target device responses as functions of polarization and wavelength. These devices include a polarization splitter, a polarization-independent power splitter, and an arbitrary polarization-dependent splitter to illustrate the capabilities of the design framework. The performance for all three devices is optimized using transfer matrix calculations; and their final responses are verified through 3D-FDTD simulations. All devices demonstrate state-of-the-art performance metrics with over 20 dB extinction, and flat-top transmission bands through bandwidths of 120 nm. In addition to the functional diversity enabled, the optimization for each device is completed in under a minute, highlighting the computational efficiency of the design paradigm presented. These results demonstrate the versatility of the deep photonic network design ecosystem in polarization management, unveiling promising prospects for advanced on-chip applications in optical communications, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <title>Emulating photonic time interfaces via smooth temporal transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of time as an additional degree of freedom to control wave-matter interactions have opened new avenues to fully control wave propagation in four dimensions (x,y,z,t). Time interfaces (rapid changes of the constitutive relations of the medium where a wave propagates) have recently become popular as they are the temporal analogue of spatial interfaces. While recent groundbreaking experimental work has demonstrated time interfaces from water waves, microwaves and the optical regime, rapidly changing, for instance, the permittivity of the medium requires carefully engineered structures. Here, we study the possibility of implementing smooth temporal transitions of the refractive index of the medium in order to mimic the response of time interfaces via adiabatic modulations. It is shown that indeed, as long as the signal is inside the structure during the modulation time, there are some values of rising/falling time of the adiabatic modulation that enables a full approximate emulation of a time interface. These results may open further avenues to explore by relaxing the speed at which the time-modulation should be introduced when designing four-dimensional media.</description>

      <title>Fast measurement of group index variation with ultimate precision using Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum sensing applications, particularly in measuring physical parameters that influence the relative optical delay between pair photons. Unlike classical techniques, HOM-based quantum sensors offer higher resolution due to their intrinsic dispersion cancellation property. Despite this advantage, achieving precise measurements of optical delay crucial for practical applications often involves time-consuming integration and post-processing with traditional statistical methods. To address this challenge, our recent work focused on optimizing optical delay measurements in a time-efficient manner. By carefully selecting the length of a 1 mm periodically-poled KTP (PPKTP) crystal for pair photon generation, we achieved a remarkable group index measurement precision of $\sim 6.75\times 10^{-6}$ per centimeter of sample length, surpassing the previous maximum precision by over 400$\%$. These current measurements maintain fast detection and high photon counts, which are essential for practical quantum sensing applications. The HOM-based method, while limiting the measurement range, can be extended by compensating for photon delay using an optical delay stage. As a proof-of-principle, we measured the group index variation of PPKTP over a temperature range up to 200$^{\circ}$C with a precision in the range of one part per million ($\sim$10$^{-6}$). This advancement not only contributes to quantum sensing but also holds promising implications for high-precision and long-range measurements in quantum optical coherence tomography.</description>

      <title>Endoscopic Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy through a fiber microprobe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a powerful analytical method for not only the chemical identification of solid, liquid, and gas species, but also the quantification of their concentration. However, the chemical quantification capability of FTIR is significantly hindered when the analyte is surrounded by a strong IR absorbing medium, such as liquid solutions. To overcome this limit, here we develop an IR fiber microprobe that can be inserted into liquid medium, and obtain full FTIR spectra at points of interest. To benchmark this endoscopic FTIR method, we insert the microprobe into bulk water covering a ZnSe substrate and measure the IR transmittance of water as a function of the probe-substrate distance. The obtained vibrational modes, overall transmittance vs z profiles, quantitative absorption coefficients, and micro z-section IR transmittance spectra are all consistent with the standard IR absorption properties of water. The results pave the way for endoscopic chemical profiling inside bulk liquid solutions, promising for applications in many biological, chemical, and electrochemical systems.</description>
