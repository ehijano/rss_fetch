      <title>Robust Social Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a society composed of individuals who have diverse sets of beliefs (or models) and diverse tastes (or utility functions). It characterizes the model selection process of a social planner who wishes to aggregate individuals' beliefs and tastes but is concerned that their beliefs are misspecified (or distorted). A novel impossibility result emerges: a utilitarian social planner who seeks robustness to misspecification never aggregates individuals' beliefs but instead behaves systematically as a dictator by selecting a single individual's belief. This tension between robustness and aggregation exists because aggregation yields policy-contingent beliefs, which are very sensitive to policy outcomes. Restoring possibility of belief aggregation requires individuals to have heterogeneous tastes and some common beliefs. This analysis reveals that misspecification has significant economic implications for welfare aggregation. These implications are illustrated in treatment choice, asset pricing, and dynamic macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>The geometry of inconvenience and perverse equilibria in trade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure bilateral trading costs is one of the key features of international trade. Drawing upon the freeness-of-trade matrix, which allows the modeling of N-state trade costs, we develop a ``geometry of inconvenience'' to better understand how they impact equilbrium outcomes. The freeness-of-trade matrix was introduced in a model by Mossay and Tabuchi, where they essentially proved that if a freeness-of-trade matrix is positive definite, then the corresponding model admits a unique equilibrium. Drawing upon the spectral theory of metrics, we prove the model admits nonunique, perverse, equilibria. We use this result to provide a family of policy relevant bipartite examples, with substantive applications to economic sanctions. More generally, we show how the network structure of the freeness of trade is central to understanding the impacts of policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Realigning Incentives to Build Better Software: a Holistic Approach to Vendor Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we ask the question of why the quality of commercial software, in terms of security and safety, does not measure up to that of other (durable) consumer goods we have come to expect. We examine this question through the lens of incentives. We argue that the challenge around better quality software is due in no small part to a sequence of misaligned incentives, the most critical of which being that the harm caused by software problems is by and large shouldered by consumers, not developers. This lack of liability means software vendors have every incentive to rush low-quality software onto the market and no incentive to enhance quality control. Within this context, this paper outlines a holistic technical and policy framework we believe is needed to incentivize better and more secure software development. At the heart of the incentive realignment is the concept of software liability. This framework touches on various components, including legal, technical, and financial, that are needed for software liability to work in practice; some currently exist, some will need to be re-imagined or established. This is primarily a market-driven approach that emphasizes voluntary participation but highlights the role appropriate regulation can play. We connect and contrast this with the EU legal environment and discuss what this framework means for open-source software (OSS) development and emerging AI risks. Moreover, we present a CrowdStrike case study complete with a what-if analysis had our proposed framework been in effect. Our intention is very much to stimulate a robust conversation among both researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Investment-Driven Insurance Pricing and Optimal Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the equilibrium of insurance market in a dynamic setting, focusing on the interaction between insurers' underwriting and investment strategies. Three possible equilibrium outcomes are identified: a positive insurance market, a zero insurance market, and market failure. Our findings reveal why insurers may rationally accept underwriting losses by setting a negative safety loading while relying on investment profits, particularly when there is a negative correlation between insurance gains and financial returns. Additionally, we explore the impact of regulatory frictions, showing that while imposing a cost on investment can enhance social welfare under certain conditions, it may not always be necessary.</description>
