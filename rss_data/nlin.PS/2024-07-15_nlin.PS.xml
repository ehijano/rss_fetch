      <title>Rotating dipole and quadrupole quantum droplets in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum droplets (QDs) are self-trapped modes stabilized by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the mean-field Hamiltonian of binary atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. The existence and stability of quiescent and rotating dipole-shaped and vortex QDs with vorticity $S=1$ (DQDs and VQDs, respectively) are numerically studied in the framework of the accordingly modified two-component system. The rotating DQDs trapped in an annular potential are built of two crescent-like components, stretching along the azimuthal direction with the increase of the rotation frequency. Rotating quadrupole QDs (QQDs) bifurcate from the VQDs with $S=2$. Above a certain rotation frequency, they transform back into VQDs with a flat-top shape. Rotating DQDs and QQDs are stable in a broad interval of values of the chemical potential. The results provide the first example of stable modes which are intermediate states between the rotating DQDs and QQDs on the one hand, and VQDs on the other.</description>

      <title>Scattering between orthogonally wobbling kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonant energy transfer mechanism, responsible for the presence of fractal patterns in the velocity diagrams of kink-antikink scattering, is analyzed for a family of two-component scalar field theory models, in which the kink solutions have two shape modes (one longitudinal and one orthogonal to the kink orbit), in addition to the zero mode, and in which energy redistribution can occur among these three discrete modes. We investigate the scattering between wobbling kinks whose orthogonal shape mode is initially excited, examining how the final velocities, amplitudes, and frequencies depend on the initial excitation amplitude. The differences that this model presents with respect to the $\phi^4$ model and its novel properties are highlighted. This analysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics that arise from the interplay between multiple degrees of freedom in kink scattering processes, offering insights distinct from those observed in simpler models.</description>

      <title>Localized States in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates: To be or not to be of second order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of localized states in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates confined to a tubular geometry. We first perform a bifurcation analysis to track their emergence in a one-dimensional domain for numerical feasibility and find that localized states can become the ground state in suitable parameter regions. Their existence for parameters featuring a supercritical primary bifurcation shows that the latter is not sufficient to conclude that the phase transition is of second order, hence density modulations can jump rather than emerging gradually. Finally, we show that localized states also exist in a three-dimensional domain.</description>
