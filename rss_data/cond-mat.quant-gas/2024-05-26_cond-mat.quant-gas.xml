      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation in long-range interacting super-Tonks-Girardeau systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate the system when the interactions are suddenly switched from the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) to the super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) limit. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the sTG gas exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the nonthermal (quantum) gas and the thermal (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce some intermediate quasi-prethermal states. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Droplets at 3D-1D Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate beyond-mean-field corrections to the energy of a one-dimensional Bose gas confined by a box potential with dipoles aligned along the unconfined direction. When the dipolar interaction reaches its critical strength, the system becomes unstable at the mean-field level. Then, similarly to the free space case, the beyond-mean-field contribution significantly alters the ground state of the system, leading to the formation of a self-bound atomic cloud known as a quantum droplet. Our analysis demonstrates that the beyond-mean-field correction can be understood as an effective three-body repulsion stabilizing the gas, preventing its collapse and leading to a finite-density solution. The quasi-1D dipolar droplets bring into play yet another subtle quantum effect: the effective three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems and generalizations in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a unified fashion, we establish Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorems and their generalizations in systems with long-range interactions. We show that, for a quantum spin chain, if the interactions decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these theorems hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Moreover, any pure state with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of the theorems through various examples.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deep Neural Network Approach To Solve Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems poses a significant challenge in physics due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space with the number of particles. Traditional methods often struggle with large system sizes and frustrated lattices. In this research article, we present a novel algorithm that leverages the power of deep neural networks combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to address these limitations. Our method introduces a neural network architecture specifically designed to represent bosonic quantum states on a 1D lattice chain. We successfully achieve the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating the superiority of the adaptive momentum optimizer for convergence speed and stability. Notably, our approach offers flexibility in simulating various lattice geometries and potentially larger system sizes, making it a valuable tool for exploring complex quantum phenomena. This work represents a substantial advancement in the field of quantum simulation, opening new possibilities for investigating previously challenging systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum slush state in Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04115v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an exotic quantum state which does not order at zero temperature in a Rydberg atom array with antiblockade mechanism. By performing an unbiased large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate a minimal model with facilitated excitation in a disorder-free system. At zero temperature, this model exhibits a heterogeneous structure of liquid and glass mixture. This state, dubbed quantum slush state, features a quasi-long-range order with an algebraic decay for its correlation function, and is different from most well-established quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Two-mode Squeezing in Floquet Engineered Power-law Interacting Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum spin 1/2 XXZ model confined in a two-dimensional bi-layer system, with couplings mediated by inverse power-law interactions, falling off with distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$, and spatio-temporal control of the spins enabled via local fields. An initial state of spins with opposite magnetization in the two layers is dynamically unstable resulting in exponential generation of correlated pairs of excitations. We find that scalable generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing between the layers can generically be achieved in powerlaw models. We further demonstrate that spatially-temporally engineered interactions allow to significantly increase the generated entanglement and in fact achieve Heisenberg limited scaling. This work is relevant to a wide variety of experimental atomic, molecular, and optical platforms, which realize powerlaw spin models, and demonstrates the advantage of spatio-temporal control to maximize the generation of metrologically useful entanglement, with potential applications in quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Exotic d-wave Bose Metal in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau Fermi liquid theory, a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, encounters limitations in explaining certain phenomena, like the peculiar behavior of strange metals in high-temperature superconductors. Non-Fermi liquids, like Bose metals with uncondensed bosonic ground state, offer potential explanations, yet constructing an elusive Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a formidable challenge. Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal in a highly anisotropic regime (a &lt; 0.30) with wide range of filling, most notably at a filling fraction of n~0.8. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of dxy correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>
