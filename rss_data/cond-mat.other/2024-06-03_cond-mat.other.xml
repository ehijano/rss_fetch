      <title>An Ultra-High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope with Pulse Tube and Joule-Thomson cooling operating at sub-pm z-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system that does not need any external supply of cooling liquids. It achieves temperatures down to 1.5 K and a z-noise down to 300 fmRMS for the frequency range of 0.1 Hz - 5 kHz (feedback loop off). It employs a pulse tube cryocooler (PTC) and a Joule-Thomson (JT) stage inducing only small temperature oscillations at the STM with amplitude below 1 mK. The challenge to combine an effective vibrational decoupling from the PTC with sufficient thermal conduction is tackled by a multipartite approach. We realize a minimal stiffness of the UHV bellows that connect the PTC and the STM chamber. Fine Copper wires mechanically decouple the PTC stages from cooling plates that carry the thermal shields, the JT stage and the STM. Soft springs decouple the STM from the JT stage. Finally, the STM body has an optimized conical shape and is made of the light and stiff material Shapal Hi MSoft such that a strong reduction of low frequency vibrations results for the tunnel junction. The voltage noise in the tunnel junction is 0.12 mV and an RF antenna close to the tunnel junction provides radio frequency excitations up to 40 GHz with amplitudes up to 10 mV.</description>

      <title>Robust Experimental Signatures of Phase Transitions in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is widely considered to be a promising candidate for a quantum-classical algorithm which could achieve near-term quantum advantage. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal singularities dominated by the dissipative photon-magnon coupling in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the magnon-photon coupling in an open cavity magnonic system, which leads to two different nonreciprocal singularities dominated by the dissipative coupling. One type of singularity is the exceptional point, which is just on the exceptional surface in parameter space. The other type of singularity is the bound state in the continuum discovered in the level-attraction-like coupling, which is above the exceptional surface. In experiment, we realized the two different singularities with nonreciprocity and selectivity in an open cavity magnonic system with suitable dissipation rating. Our results can be understood well with the pseudo-Hermitian theory of magnon-polariton system.</description>
