      <title>Fast surrogate modelling of EIT in atomic quantum systems using LSTM neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of optical quantum systems are essential for the development of quantum technologies. However, these simulations are often computationally intensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting, parameter estimation, or real-time feedback. To address this challenge, we develop a Long Short-Term Memory neural network capable of replicating the output of these simulations with high accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost. Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in milliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical solvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for Rydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver for resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a surrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and feedback-based optimisation.</description>

      <title>QED vacuum polarization in the Coulomb field of a nucleus: a method of high-order calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A calculation of the QED vacuum polarization potential in the Coulomb field of a pointlike nucleus was presented in an earlier publication by the author and his collaborators. Corrections up to order $\alpha^2 (Z\alpha)^7$ were evaluated, where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $Z\alpha$ is treated as an independent variable. These corrections correspond to two-loop Feynman graphs with proper propagators of fermions in the external field. The calculation employed a reduction to free QED, leading to free QED Feynman graphs with up to eight independent loops. The method of calculation is described here in detail.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Synchronization in Thermal Rydberg Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical non-reciprocity is a fundamental phenomenon in photonics. It is crucial for developing devices that rely on directional signal control, such as optical isolators and circulators. However, most research in this field has focused on systems in equilibrium or steady states. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature Rydberg atomic platform where the unidirectional propagation of light acts as a switch to mediate time-crystalline-like collective oscillations through atomic synchronization. We find that thermal-motion-induced coupling asymmetry, enabled by counterpropagating probe and control fields, generates persistent oscillations; conversely, co-propagation quenches this effect. We identify, through both numerical and analytical approaches, the criteria for realizing optical non-reciprocity within a synchronization regime. These results provide key insights for chiral quantum optics and promote the on-chip integration of non-reciprocal devices in nonequilibrium many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle properties of long-range impurities in a Bose condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An impurity immersed in a Bose condensate can form a quasiparticle known as a Bose polaron. When the impurity-boson interaction is short-ranged, the quasiparticle properties can be characterized in terms of the impurity-boson scattering length $a_{\mathrm{IB}}$ and the condensate coherence length $\xi$, a universal description that remains valid irrespective of the bath density $n_0$. Long-ranged interactions -- such as provided by Rydberg or ionic impurities -- introduce an effective interaction range $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as the third length scale. These competing length scales raise the question of whether a universal description remains valid across different bath densities. In this study, we discuss the quasiparticle nature of long-range impurities and its dependence on the length scales $n_0^{-1/3}$, $r_\mathrm{eff}$, and $\xi$. We employ two complementary theories -- the coherent state Ansatz and the perturbative Gross-Pitaevskii theory -- which incorporate beyond-Fr\"ohlich interactions. We derive an analytical expression for the beyond-Fr\"ohlich effective mass for a contact interaction and numerically compute the effective mass for long-range impurities. We argue that the coupling parameter $|a_{\mathrm{IB}}|n_0^{1/3}$ remains the principal parameter governing the properties of the polaron. For weak ($|a_\mathrm{IB}|n_0^{1/3}\ll 1$) and intermediate ($|a_\mathrm{IB}|n_0^{1/3}\simeq 1$) values of the coupling parameter, long-range impurities in a Bose condensate are well-described as quasiparticles with a finite quasiparticle weight and a well-defined effective mass. However, the quasiparticle weight becomes significantly suppressed as the effective impurity volume is occupied by an increasing number of bath particles ($r_{\mathrm{eff}}n_0^{1/3} \gg 1$).</description>

      <title>Analytical study of a finite-range impurity in a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional Bose gases present an interesting setting to study the physics of Bose polarons, as density fluctuations play an enhanced role due to reduced dimensionality. Theoretical descriptions of this system have predominantly relied on contact pseudopotentials to model the impurity-bath interaction, leading to unphysical results in the strongly coupled limit. In this work, we analytically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, using a square well potential instead of a zero-range potential, for the ground-state wave function of a static impurity. We compute perturbative corrections arising from infinitesimally slow impurity motion. The polaron energy and effective mass remain finite in the strongly coupled regime, in contrast to the divergent behavior obtained using a contact potential. In this limit, we characterize the polaron properties in terms of the dimensionless ratio $\bar{w}\equiv w/\xi$ between the interaction range $w$ of the impurity-bath potential and the coherence length $\xi$ of the Bose gas. The effective mass exhibits a $1/\bar{w}$ scaling. The energy of the attractive polaron scales as $-1/\bar{w}^3$, whereas the repulsive polaron features subleading corrections to the dark soliton energy at the order $\bar{w}^3$.</description>

      <title>Detecting milli-Hz gravitational waves with optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>
