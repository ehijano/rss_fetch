      <title>Design and control of three-dimensional topological magnetic fields using interwoven helical nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic nanostructures are an emerging platform capable of creating complex topological magnetic fields. The control of localized nanoscale magnetic fields is seen to be of importance for diverse areas from bio-applications such as drug delivery, nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging, as well as condensed matter physics such as particle trapping, and controlling Majorana fermions for quantum computing. Three-dimensional geometric curvature, confinement and proximity can create tailormade spin textures not possible in two-dimensions. The control of magnetization afforded here can allow the formation of unique and reconfigurable stray field patterns and topologies. Here, we report the creation of reconfigurable 3D topological magnetic field textures induced by a single interwoven 3D nanostructure and an applied field protocol. These field textures emerge due to distinct types of domain walls formed in this structure and lead to the creation of an anti-vortex field, a hexapole cusp and a 3D skyrmion field tube of mixed chirality. Our results therefore show a key step towards the design and control of topological magnetic fields on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Graphene calorimetric single-photon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photon detectors (SPDs) are essential technology in quantum science, quantum network, biology, and advanced imaging. To detect the small quantum of energy carried in a photon, conventional SPDs rely on energy excitation across either a semiconductor bandgap or superconducting gap. While the energy gap suppresses the false-positive error, it also sets an energy scale that can limit the detection efficiency of lower energy photons and spectral bandwidth of the SPD. Here, we demonstrate an orthogonal approach to detect single near-infrared photons using graphene calorimeters. By exploiting the extremely low heat capacity of the pseudo-relativistic electrons in graphene near its charge neutrality point, we observe an electron temperature rise up to ~2 K using a hybrid Josephson junction. In this proof-of-principle experiment, we achieve an intrinsic quantum efficiency of 87% (75%) with dark count &lt; 1 per second (per hour) at operation temperatures as high as 1.2 K. Our results highlight the potential of electron calorimetric SPDs for detecting lower-energy photons from the mid-IR to microwave regimes, opening pathways to study space science in far-infrared regime, to search for dark matter axions, and to advance quantum technologies across a broader electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in a topological superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum phase transitions in a long and narrow topological Josephson junction. The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to magnons in an embedded ferromagnetic layer. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict the existence of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and easy-axis anisotropy. In the easy-axis regime, this is based on an emerging effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the first on-chip frequency multiplexed readout of two co-integrated single-electron transistors without the need for bulky resonators. We characterize single electron dynamics in both single electron transistors at 4.2K before validating their simultaneous readout within 2.2{\mu}s, achieving a 99.9% fidelity with a 1MHz frequency spacing. This experimental demonstration paves the way towards resonator-free large-scale quantum-classical architectures that would be required for future universal and reprogrammable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable moir\'e superlattice potentials in twisted hexagonal boron nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an advanced atomically thin van der Waals interfacial ferroelectricity platform. Nanoscale periodic ferroelectric moir\'e domains with out-of-plane potentials in twisted hBN allow the hosting of remote Coulomb superlattice potentials to adjacent two-dimensional materials for tailoring strongly correlated properties. Therefore, the new strategies for engineering moir\'e length, angle, and potential strength are essential for developing programmable quantum materials and advanced twistronics applications devices. Here, we demonstrate the realization of twisted hBN-based moir\'e superlattice platforms and visualize the moir\'e domains and ferroelectric properties using Kelvin probe force microscopy. Also, we report the KPFM result of regular moir\'e superlattice in the large area. It offers the possibility to reproduce uniform moir\'e structures with precise control piezo stage stacking and heat annealing. We demonstrate the high tunability of twisted hBN moir\'e platforms and achieve cumulative multi-ferroelectric polarization and multi-level domains with multiple angle mismatched interfaces. Additionally, we observe the quasi-1D anisotropic moir\'e domains and show the highest resolution analysis of the local built-in strain between adjacent hBN layers compared to the conventional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate in-situ manipulation of moir\'e superlattice potential strength using femtosecond pulse laser irradiation, which results in the optical phonon-induced atomic displacement at the hBN moir\'e interfaces. Our results pave the way to develop precisely programmable moir\'e superlattice platforms and investigate strongly correlated physics in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Absence of edge states at armchair edges in inhomogeneously strained graphene under a pseudomagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonuniform strain in graphene can induce a pseudo-magnetic field (PMF) preserving time-reversal symmetry, generating pseudo-Landau levels under zero real magnetic field (MF). The different natures between PMF and real MF lead to the counterpropagating valley-polarized edge states under the PMF and unidirectionally chiral edge states under the real MF. In this work, we find, due to the valley mixing on the armchair edges, the quantum valley Hall edge states only exist at the zigzag edges but not at armchair edges in a uniaxial strained graphene, very different from the case that chiral quantum Hall edge states exist at all edges in pristine graphene under a real MF. We theoretically demonstrate it through the wave function distributions, multi-terminal transport measurements and the electron local occupations, respectively. The interface state in a p-n junction under PMF is further proposed to transport electrons between the conductive zigzag boundaries, which could be used as a valley-polarized single pole double throw switch.</description>

      <title>Thermal dissipation of the quantum spin Hall edge states in HgTe/CdTe quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall effect is characterized by topologically protected helical edge states. Here we study the thermal dissipation of helical edge states by considering two types of dissipation sources. The results show that the helical edge states are dissipationless for normal dissipation sources with or without Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the system, but they are dissipative for spin dissipation sources. Further studies on the energy distribution show that electrons with spin-up and spin-down are both in their own equilibrium without dissipation sources. Spin dissipation sources can couple the two subsystems together to induce voltage drop and nonequilibrium distribution, leading to thermal dissipation, while normal dissipation sources cannot. With the increase of thermal dissipation, the subsystems of electrons with spin-up and spin-down evolve from non-equilibrium finally to mutual equilibrium. In addition, the effects of disorder on thermal dissipation are also discussed. Our work provides clues to reduce thermal dissipation in the quantum spin Hall systems</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in an ambipolar InSb nanowire quantum dot device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor InSb nanowires present a highly intriguing platform with immense potential for applications in spintronics and topological quantum devices. The narrow band gap exhibited by InSb allows for precise tuning of these nanowires, facilitating smooth transitions between the electron transport region and the hole transport region. In this study, we demonstrate quantum transport measurements obtained from a high-quality InSb nanowire quantum dot device. By utilizing a back gate, this device can be adjusted from an electron-populated quantum dot regime to a hole-populated one. Within both regimes, we have observed dozens of consecutive quantum levels without any charge rearrangement or impurity-induced interruptions. Our investigations in the electron transport regime have explored phenomena such as Coulomb blockade effect, Zeeman effect,and Kondo effect. Meanwhile, in the hole-transport regime, we have identified conductance peaks induced by lead states. Particularly, we have created a tomographic analysis method of these lead states by tracking the behavior of these conductance peaks across consecutive Coulomb diamond structures.</description>

      <title>Observation of Anderson localization transitions in a two-dimensional conjugated metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization transitions are a universal quantum phenomenon sensitive to the disorder and dimensionality of electronic systems. Over the past decades, this intriguing topic has inspired overwhelmingly more theoretical studies than experimental verifications due to the difficulty of controlling a material's disorder or dimensionality without modifying its fundamental electronic properties. Organic crystals with their rich disorders would be terrific playgrounds to investigate such disorder-driven phase transitions except for their low conductivities which usually prohibit low-temperature measurements. Here, we conduct systematic transport experiments in mesoscopic devices made with copper benzenehexathiol thin films across a wide range of thicknesses. We find metal-insulator transitions both among three-dimensional samples with different disorder strengths and between three-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional samples. Temperature-dependence analysis of the conductivities corroborates the dimensionality crossover. Moreover, our theoretical modeling provides a basis for understanding both types of metal-insulator transitions within the framework of Anderson localization transitions. Our findings establish for the first time that organic crystals such as conductive metal-organic frameworks can exhibit such quantum interference effects. With organic materials' versatile chemical designs and crystalline structures, our work opens new avenues to search for novel quantum phenomena in organic material platforms.</description>

      <title>On the origin of filamentary resistive switching in oxides-based memristive devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control and manipulation of filamentary resistive switching (FRS) is essential for practical applications in fields like non-volatile memories and neuromorphic computing. However, key aspects of the dynamics of conductive filament formation and their influence on device resistance remain incompletely understood. In this work we study FRS in binary oxides based memristors by investigating the dynamics of oxygen vacancies (OV) on a two dimensional lattice and their role in forming low-resistance paths that facilitate the transition between high and low global resistance states. We reveal that the mere formation of an OV percolation path is insufficient to induce a transition to a low-resistance state. Instead, an OV concentration exceeding a critical threshold across all sites in the filament is required to generate a low-resistivity conducting path. Furthermore, we simulate the impact of static defects -which block OV migration and would correspond to voids in real porous samples-, on filament formation. We show that there is a range of defect density values where OV percolate through the sample, leading to the formation of OV filaments, but conductive paths remain absent. Additionally, a small concentration of defects can reduce the final value of the low-resistance state, thereby increasing the ON-OFF ratio. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing defective nanomaterials with memristive properties, which are crucial for advancing in-memory and neuromorphic computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Designing Majorana Quasiparticles in InAsP Quantum Dots in InP Nanowires with Variational Quantum Eigenvalue Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of Spin Cycloids in a Non-collinear Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation in spin systems with continuous-rotational symmetry (CRS) provides a powerful platform to study emergent complex magnetic phases and topological defects in condensed-matter physics. However, its understanding and correlation with unconventional magnetic order along with high-resolution nanoscale imaging is challenging. Here, we employ scanning NV magnetometry to unveil the morphogenesis of spin cycloids at both the local and global scales within a single ferroelectric domain of (111)-oriented BiFeO$_3$ (which is a non-collinear antiferromagnet), resulting in formation of a glassy labyrinthine pattern. We find that the domains of locally oriented cycloids are interconnected by an array of topological defects and exhibit isotropic energy landscape predicted by first-principles calculations. We propose that the CRS of spin-cycloid propagation directions within the (111) drives the formation of the labyrinthine pattern and the associated topological defects such as antiferromagnetic skyrmions. Unexpectedly, reversing the as-grown ferroelectric polarization from [$\bar{1}$$\bar{1}$$\bar{1}$] to [111] induces a magnetic phase transition, destroying the labyrinthine pattern and producing a deterministic non-volatile non cycloidal, uniformly magnetized state. These findings highlight that (111)-oriented BiFeO$_3$ is not only important for studying the fascinating subject of pattern formation but could also be utilized as an ideal platform for integrating novel topological defects in the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq 2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case ($n = 1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of the linearity of the spectrum for arbitrary n over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_f$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of a photoinduced topological phase transition in Bi-doped (Pb,Sn)Se</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast photoexcitation offers a novel approach to manipulating quantum materials. One of the long-standing goals in this field is to achieve optical control over topological properties. However, the impact on their electronic structures, which host gapless surface states, has yet to be directly observed. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we visualize the photo-induced evolution of the band structure in Biy(Pb1-xSnx)1-ySe(111) films from topological to trivial insulators. Following near-infrared ultrafast laser excitation, we observe that the topological surface state opens a substantial gap of up to 0.1 eV. Considering the topological phase diagram associated with lattice distortion and atomic displacement, we show that a uniaxial strain generated by the ultrafast optical pulse is sufficiently effective and strong for the observed topological phase transition. Our study highlights the potential of optical tuning of materials through laser excitation to control topological properties on ultrafast timescales.</description>

Abstract: Continuum-type constitutive relations of odd matter need to be formulated according to the second law of thermodynamics. Based on the primitive thermodynamics of Edelen, a procedure admitting most general relations, is outlined for heat-conducting fluids and solids. For viscous responses of odd matter, the theory accounts for the irreversible and non-dissipative forces, besides the hyperdissipative ones. For quasi-static responses, the theory grasps the elastic and non-conservative forces besides those derivable from the free energy, this being the realm of Cauchy elasticity beyond hyperelasticity. In Cosserat-type odd matter, primitive thermodynamics also accounts for curvature-torsion and couple-stress besides, respectively, deformation and force-stress tensors. In both, classical and micropolar cases, the theory grasps all possible couplings between the thermodynamic velocity and force vectors, along with a full range of anisotropies of hyperdissipative and hyperelastic responses (both linear and nonlinear).</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and stabilization of perovskite phase EuNiO3 thin films through RF sputtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) that exhibit volatile resistive switching are promising for emulating neuronal oscillators. Charge transfer insulators, such as ReNiO3 (where Re represents rare earth metals like Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu...), form a family of PCMs with tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) temperatures across a broad range. Notably, MIT can be adjusted via chemical doping or strain engineering. EuNiO3, in particular, is an attractive choice for oscillator devices given its bulk transition temperature (TMI) of approximately 190{\deg}C, which is well above room temperature, reducing crosstalk issues while remaining low enough to support energy-efficient applications. We demonstrate a method to stabilize high-quality epitaxial EuNiO3 thin films through scalable reactive RF sputtering and post-annealing, optimizing oxygen partial pressures and annealing temperatures across two substrates. Growth at low or zero oxygen partial pressures resulted in amorphous samples, while higher pressures improved crystallinity but led to the stabilization of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases [An+1BnO3n+1] and associated faults. Post-annealing enhanced crystallinity in all samples, transforming RP phases and faults toward the perovskite phase.
  We conducted operando XRD and transport measurements on our films, finding the transition temperatures of perovskite phase samples grown on LAO and LSAT to be approximately 300{\deg}C and 250{\deg}C, respectively. We attribute the increase in TMI for LAO samples to in-plane compressive strain (-0.76%), which reduces the Ni-O-Ni bond angles in-plane. Similarly, LSAT samples experience in-plane tensile strain (2.1%), which decreases out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles, increasing TMI compared to bulk. However, this is counteracted by oxygen vacancies due to lowered formation energies. Films that stabilized in RP phases did not exhibit any transition.</description>

      <title>Polarization boost and ferroelectricity down to one unit cell in layered Carpy-Galy La$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered perovskite-based compounds offer a range of unconventional properties enabled by their naturally anisotropic structure. While most renowned for the superconductivity observed in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases, many of these layered compounds are also ferroelectric and exhibit a sizeable in-plane polarization. Among these, the Carpy-Galy phases (A${_n}$B${_n}$O$_{3n+2}$), characterized by 110-oriented perovskite planes interleaved with additional oxygen layers, have been debated as platforms for hosting not only a robust polarization but also multiferroicity and polar metallicity. However, the challenges associated with the synthesis of ultrathin Carpy-Galy films and understanding the impact of strain on their properties limit their integration into devices. Addressing this issue, our study focuses on La$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, an $n$=4 (A$_2$B$_2$O$_7$) representative of the Carpy-Galy family, exploring its growth and concurrent phase stability on various substrates under different strain conditions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a 3% tensile strain from DyScO$_3$ (100) substrates promotes a controlled layer-by-layer growth mode, while SrTiO$_3$ (110) and LaAlO$_3$-Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$ (110), that exert negligible and compressive strains respectively, require post-deposition annealing to achieve similar results. Using scanning probe microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and polarization switching experiments, we confirm that these films possess exceptional ferroelectric properties, including a polarization of 18 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ - more than three times higher than previously reported - as well as persistence of ferroelectricity down to a single-unit-cell thickness. This study not only advances our understanding of Carpy-Galy phases in thin films but also lays a foundation for their application in advanced ferroelectric device architectures.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal field controls vector vortex beams in anisotropic epsilon-near-zero metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured light plays an important role in metrology, optical trapping and manipulation, communications, quantum technologies, nonlinear optics and provides a rich playground for addressing new optical phenomena. Here we demonstrate a novel approach for manipulating vector vortex beams carrying longitudinal field components using metamaterials with extreme anisotropy. Implementing vectorial spectroscopy, we show that the propagation of complex beams with inhomogeneous polarisation is strongly affected by the interplay of the metamaterial anisotropy with the transverse and longitudinal field structure of the beam. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in the epsilon-near-zero regime, exclusively realised for light polarised along the metamaterial optical axis, strongly influencing the interaction of longitudinal fields with the metamaterial. The requirements on the balance between the transverse and longitudinal fields to maintain a polarisation singularity at the beam axis allow control of the beam modal content, filtering diffraction effects and tailoring spatial polarisation distribution. The proposed approach offers important capabilities for wavefront shaping as well as local spatial polarisation engineering. The understanding of the interaction of vector beams with metamaterials opens new opportunities for applications in microscopy, information encoding, biochemical sensing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin resonance without a spin: A microwave analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analog of nuclear magnetic resonance is realized in a microwave network with symplectic symmetry. The network consists of two identical subgraphs coupled by a pair of bonds with a length difference corresponding to a phase difference of $\pi$ for the waves traveling through the bonds. As a consequence all eigenvalues appear as Kramers doublets. Detuning the length difference from the $\pi$ condition Kramers degeneracy is lifted, which may be interpreted as a Zeeman splitting of a spin 1/2 in a magnetic field. The lengths of another pair of bonds are modulated periodically with frequencies of some 10 MHz by means of diodes, thus emulating a magnetic radiofrequency field. Features well-known from NMR such as the transition from the laboratory to the rotating frame, and Lorentzian shaped resonance curves can thus be realized.</description>

Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time of the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we amend these issues by incorporating numerical methods that lift some of the previously applied approximations. Our results agree with the experimental measurements, also for devices with shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Fragile non-Bloch spectrum and unconventional Green's function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian systems, it is a counterintuitive feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that the energy spectrum and eigenstates can be totally different under open or periodic boundary conditions, suggesting that non-Hermitian spectra can be extremely sensitive to non-local perturbations. Here, we show that a wide range of non-Hermitian models with NHSE can even be highly sensitive to local perturbation under open boundary conditions. The spectrum of these models is so fragile that it can be significantly modified by adding only exponentially small perturbations on boundaries. Intriguingly, we show that such fragile spectra are quantified by the Green's function exhibiting unconventional V-shape asymptotic behaviors. Accordingly, bi-directional exponential amplification can be observed. As an interesting consequence, we find a real-to-complex transition of the bulk spectrum induced by exponentially small boundary perturbations. Finally, we reveal a hierarchy of the asymptotic behaviors of non-Hermitian Green's functions, which restricts the frequency range for the presence of unconventional Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton Spectroscopy of a Dynamical Axion Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unusual magnetoelectric transport present in Weyl semimetals can be compactly understood as manifestations of an underlying axion field, which itself is determined by the microscopic band structure. The axion couples nonlinearly to electric and magnetic fields and possesses a signature topological magnetoelectric response, leading to a modified form of Maxwell's equations known as axion electrodynamics. Axions are naturally present in Weyl semimetals relating to the separation of the Weyl nodes in energy and in crystal momentum. In the presence of strong interactions, charge density-wave (CDW) order may develop which serves to gap the Weyl nodes and introduces corresponding collective excitations. When the inherent chiral symmetry of Weyl semimetals is spontaneously broken by the formation of CDW order, the resultant chiral condensate is endowed with intrinsic dynamics which yields a dynamical contribution to the axion field. However, unambiguous identification of this dynamical axion mode is challenging due to its inherent nonlinear coupling to electromagnetic fields. Therefore, we propose an all-optical protocol for verifying and characterizing dynamical axion collective modes in Weyl semimetals with CDW order. First, we show that axion collective mode can be excited using two-photon excitation schemes. Following excitation, the collective axion oscillations are then diagnosed by measuring the time-resolved Kerr rotation. Our results demonstrate a pathway towards utilizing multi-photon and entangled pair spectroscopies to identify new correlated phases in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Entropy and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of a three-dimensional marginal Fermi liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in a marginal Fermi liquid resulting from a three-dimensional metal tuned to a quantum-critical point (QCP). We show that the conventional approach based on extensions of the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula for the oscillation amplitudes becomes inapplicable when the correlation length exceeds the cyclotron radius. This breakdown is due to (i) non-analytic finite-temperature contributions to the fermion self-energy (ii) an enhancement of the oscillatory part of the self-energy by quantum fluctuations, and (iii) non-trivial dynamical scaling laws associated with the quantum critical point. We properly incorporate these effects within the Luttinger-Ward-Eliashberg framework for the thermodynamic potential by treating the fermionic and bosonic contributions on equal footing. As a result, we obtain the modified expressions for the oscillations of entropy and magnetization that remain valid in the non-Fermi liquid regime.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ) at equilibrium, using exact path integral techniques. Our writing of the effective action makes it clear that the superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ, cannot exist. This can be traced to translational invariances in the Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian making the junction's reduced ground state highly degenerate and actually lacking the symmetry that the transition is supposed to break. For all parameters, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted in part from ill-assuming it would not. Our results fully support and confirm the experimental invalidation of this quantum phase transition by Murani et al. in 2020.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with anomalous phase shift $\varphi_0$ ($\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs) implement a coupling between the superconducting phase and the spin degrees of freedom. Here we investigate the dynamics of voltage-biased coupled chains of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs and predict that the presence of $\varphi_0$ makes the conventional regime corresponding to the linear growth of the superconducting phase at each of the junctions and oscillating Josephson current unstable. New stable regimes are found and investigated. The changes of the dynamic behavior are clearly seen in the IV-characteristics of the system and can serve as a fingerprint of the presence of the magnetoelectric coupling $\varphi_0$. Moreover, the collective magnetic excitations of the chains of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs, which were reported by G.A. Bobkov {\it et. al.} [JETP Lett. {\bf 119}, 251 (2024)] also manifest themselves in the IV-characteristics. This provides a method for their experimental detection and direct measurement of the constant quantifying the strength of the coupling between the superconducting phase and the spin degrees of freedom.</description>
