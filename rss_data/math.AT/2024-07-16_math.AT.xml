      <title>Towards $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory of rigid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To any rigid analytic space (in the sense of Fujiwara-Kato) we assign an $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant rigid analytic homotopy category with coefficients in any presentable category. We show some functorial properties of this assignment as a functor on the category of rigid analytic spaces. Moreover, we show that there exists a full six functor formalism for the precomposition with the analytification functor by evoking Ayoub's thesis. As an application, we identify connective analytic K-theory in the unstable homotopy category with both $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathrm{BGL}$ and the analytification of connective algebraic K-theory. As a consequence, we get a representability statement for coefficients in light condensed spectra.</description>

      <title>Products in spin$^c$-cobordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the mod $2$ spin$^c$-cobordism ring up to uniform $F$-isomorphism (i.e., inseparable isogeny). As a consequence we get the prime ideal spectrum of the mod $2$ spin$^c$-cobordism ring. We also calculate the mod $2$ spin$^c$-cobordism ring ``on the nose'' in degrees $\leq 33$. We construct an infinitely generated nonunital subring of the $2$-torsion in the spin$^c$-cobordism ring. We use our calculations of product structure in the spin and spin$^c$ cobordism rings to give an explicit example, up to cobordism, of a compact $24$-dimensional spin manifold which is not cobordant to a sum of squares, which was asked about in a 1965 question of Milnor.</description>

      <title>Homology of strict polynomial functors over Fp-linear additive categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the strong comparison theorem of Franjou, Friedlander, Scorichenko and Suslin to the setting of Fp-linear additive categories. Our results have a strong impact in terms of explicit computations of functor homology, and they open the way to new applications to stable homology of groups or to K-theory. As an illustration, we prove comparison theorems between cohomologies of classical algebraic groups over infinite perfect fields, in the spirit of a celebrated result of Cline, Parshall, Scott et van der Kallen for finite fields.</description>

      <title>Loop space decompositions of moment-angle complexes associated to two dimensional simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the loop space of a moment-angle complex associated to a $2$-dimensional simplicial complex decomposes as a finite type product of spheres, loops on spheres, and certain indecomposable spaces which appear in the loop space decomposition of Moore spaces. We also give conditions on certain subcomplexes under which, localised away from sufficiently many primes, the loop space of a moment-angle complex decomposes as a finite type product of spheres and loops on spheres.</description>

      <title>From bordisms of three-manifolds to domain walls between topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between spin three-manifolds and bosonic abelian topological orders. Let $N$ be a spin three-manifold. We can define a $(2+1)$-dimensional topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$ as follows: its anyons are the torsion elements in $H_1(N)$, the braiding of anyons is given by the linking form, and their topological spins are given by the quadratic refinement of the linking form obtained from the spin structure. Under this correspondence, a surgery presentation of $N$ gives rise to a classical Chern--Simons description of the associated topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$. We then extend the correspondence to spin bordisms between three-manifolds, and domain walls between topological orders. In particular, we construct a domain wall $\mathcal{D}_M$ between $\mathrm{TO}_N$ and $\mathrm{TO}_{N'}$, where $M$ is a spin bordism from $N$ to $N'$. This domain wall unfolds to a composition of a gapped boundary, obtained from anyon condensation, and a gapless Narain boundary CFT.</description>

      <title>Mackey functors for posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize cofibrant objects in the category of functors indexed in a filtered poset and we show that these objects are acyclic. As a consequence, we show that Mackey functors over posets are also acyclic, where we define this type of Mackey functors mimicking the classical notion. As application, we study homotopy colimits over posets and we give a homology decomposition for the classifying space of the Bianchi group $\Gamma_1$.</description>

      <title>The Nucleus of a Compact Lie Group, and Support of Singularity Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we adapt the notion of the nucleus defined by Benson, Carlson, and Robinson to compact Lie groups in non-modular characteristic. We show that it describes the singularities of the projective scheme of the cohomology of its classifying space. A notion of support for singularity categories of ring spectra (in the sense of Greenlees and Stevenson) is established, and is shown to be precisely the nucleus in this case, consistent with a conjecture of Benson and Greenlees for finite groups.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic sets as a model of homotopy types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets are presheaves on a rich category of shapes, whose definition is motivated by combinatorial topology and higher-dimensional diagram rewriting. These shapes include representatives of oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes, and are stable under operations including Gray products, joins, suspensions, and duals. We exhibit a cofibrantly generated model structure on diagrammatic sets, as well as two separate Quillen equivalences with the classical model structure on simplicial sets. We construct explicit sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations, and prove that the model structure is monoidal with the Gray product of diagrammatic sets.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of noncommutative motives and secondary algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.04021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a universal characterization of the construction taking a scheme $X$ to its stable $\infty$-category $\text{Mot}(X)$ of noncommutative motives, patterned after the universal characterization of algebraic K-theory due to Blumberg--Gepner--Tabuada. As a consequence, we obtain a corepresentability theorem for secondary K-theory. We envision this as a fundamental tool for the construction of trace maps from secondary K-theory.
  Towards these main goals, we introduce a preliminary formalism of "stable $(\infty, 2)$-categories"; notable examples of these include (quasicoherent or constructible) sheaves of stable $\infty$-categories. We also develop the rudiments of a theory of presentable enriched $\infty$-categories -- and in particular, a theory of presentable $(\infty, n)$-categories -- which may be of intependent interest.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for contractads and modular compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contractads are operadic-type algebraic structures well-suited for describing configuration spaces indexed by a simple connected graph $\Gamma$. Specifically, these configuration spaces are defined as $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X):=X^{|V(\Gamma)|}\setminus \cup_{(ij)\in E(\Gamma)} \{x_i=x_j\}$. In this paper, we explore functional equations for the Hilbert series of Koszul dual contractads and provide explicit Hilbert series for fundamental contractads such as the commutative, Lie, associative and the little discs contractads.
  Additionally, we focus on a particular contractad derived from the wonderful compactifications of $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{k})$, for $\mathbb{k}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$. First, we demonstrate that for complete multipartite graphs, the associated wonderful compactifications coincide with the modular compactifications introduced by Smyth. Second, we establish that the homology of the complex points and the homology of the real locus of the wonderful contractad are both quadratic and Koszul contractads. We offer a detailed description of generators and relations, extending the concepts of the Hypercommutative operad and cacti operads, respectively. Furthermore, using the functional equations for the Hilbert series, we describe the corresponding Hilbert series for the homology of modular compactifications.</description>

      <title>Notes on A-infinity algebras, A-infinity categories and non-commutative geometry. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606241</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0606241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop geometric approach to A-infinity algebras and A-infinity categories based on the notion of formal scheme in the category of graded vector spaces. Geometric approach clarifies several questions, e.g. the notion of homological unit or A-infinity structure on A-infinity functors. We discuss Hochschild complexes of A-infinity algebras from geometric point of view. The paper contains homological versions of the notions of properness and smoothness of projective varieties as well as the non-commutative version of Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration conjecture. We also discuss a generalization of Deligne's conjecture which includes both Hochschild chains and cochains. We conclude the paper with the description of an action of the PROP of singular chains of the topological PROP of 2-dimensional surfaces on the Hochschild chain complex of an A-infinity algebra with the scalar product. This action is essentially equivalent to the structure of 2-dimensional Topological Field Theory associated with a Calabi-Yau category.</description>
