      <title>How Theory-laden are Observations of Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the roles general relativistic assumptions play in simulations used in recent observations of black holes including LIGO-Virgo and the Event Horizon Telescope. In both experiments simulations play an ampliative role, enabling the extraction of more information from the data than would be possible otherwise. This comes at a cost of theory-ladenness. We discuss the issue of inferential circularity, which arises in some applications; classify some of the epistemic strategies used to reduce the extent of theory-ladenness; and discuss ways in which these strategies are model independent.</description>

      <title>Steven Weinberg: A Scientific Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steven Weinberg was a giant of late 20th Century physics on whose shoulders we stand while groping for the science of the 21st Century. This article provides a too-brief summary of a selection of his many achievements -- eight decades of superlative research, eight classic textbooks, eight best-selling forays into popular science writing and more.</description>

      <title>Hyperdeterminism? Spacetime 'Analyzed'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When modelling spacetime and classical physical fields, one typically assumes smoothness (infinite differentiability). But this assumption and its philosophical implications have not been sufficiently scrutinized. For example, we can appeal to analytic functions instead, which are also often used by physicists. Doing so leads to very different philosophical interpretations of a theory. For instance, our world would be 'hyperdeterministic' with analytic functions, in the sense that every field configuration is uniquely determined by its restriction to an arbitrarily small region. Relatedly, the hole argument of general relativity does not get off the ground. We argue that such an appeal to analytic functions is technically feasible and, conceptually, not obviously objectionable. The moral is to warn against rushing to draw philosophical conclusions from physical theories, given their drastic sensitivity to mathematical formalisms.</description>

      <title>Does a Fine-Tuned Universe Tell Us Anything About God?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent fine-tuning of several fundamental parameters that determine the properties of our Universe and make it hospitable to life is sometimes used as an argument for God from design. I review the concept of cosmic fine-tuning and critically examine the claim that God is its most probable cause. While not definitively repudiating this claim, I argue that it is potentially in tension with the more apophatic approach to God found in the Abrahamic traditions. I then offer a metaphysical analysis of the contingency of fine-tuning that situates it within the classical analogy of being that points to the Divinity.</description>
