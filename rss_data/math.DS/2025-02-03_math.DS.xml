      <title>Dimension of limit sets in variable curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of an arbitrary Kleinian group of isometries of a complete simply-connected Riemannian manifold with pinched negative sectional curvatures $-b^2\leq k\leq -1$. Moreover, we construct hyperbolic surfaces with a set of non-recurrent orbits of dimension zero.</description>

      <title>Steady State Classification of Allee Effect System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the steady state classification problem of the Allee effect system for multiple tribes. First, we reduce the high-dimensional model into several two-dimensional and three-dimensional algebraic systems such that we can prove a comprehensive formula of the border polynomial for arbitrary dimension. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for classifying the generic parameters according to the number of steady states, and we successfully complete the computation for up to the seven-dimensional Allee effect system.</description>

      <title>Analiticity of the Lyapunov exponents of random products of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the study of random (Bernoulli and Markovian) product of matrices on a compact space of symbols. We establish the analyticity of the maximal Lyapunov exponent as a function of the transition probabilities, thus extending the results and methods of Y. Peres from a finite to an infinite (but compact) space of symbols. Our approach combines the spectral properties of the associated Markov operator with the theory of holomorphic functions in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>On the minimal components of substitution subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study substitutions on $A^\mathbb{Z}$ where $A$ is a finite alphabet. We precisely characterize the minimal components of substitution subshifts, give an optimal bound for their number and describe their dynamics. The explicitness of these results provides a method to algorithmically compute and count the minimal components of a given substitution subshift.</description>

      <title>Optimal transportation and pressure at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two compact metric spaces $X$ and $Y$, a Lipschitz continuous cost function $c$ on $X \times Y$ and two probabilities $\mu \in\mathcal{P}(X),\,\nu\in\mathcal{P}(Y)$, we propose to study the Monge-Kantorovich problem and its duality from a zero temperature limit of a convex pressure function. We consider the entropy defined by $H(\pi) = -D_{KL}(\pi|\mu\times \nu)$, where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and then the pressure defined by the variational principle \[P(\beta A) = \sup_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu,\nu)} \left[ \smallint \beta A\,d\pi + H(\pi)\right],\]where $\beta&gt;0$ and $A=-c$. We will show that it admits a dual formulation and when $\beta \to+\infty$ we recover the solution for the usual Monge-Kantorovich problem and its Kantorovich duality. Such approach is similar to one which is well known in Thermodynamic Formalism and Ergodic Optimization, where $\beta$ is interpreted as the inverse of the temperature ($\beta = \frac{1}{T}$) and $\beta\to+\infty$ is interpreted as a zero temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>Noisy Fixed Points: Stability of the Invariant Distribution of the Random Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full family of discrete logistic maps has been widely studied both as a canonical example of the period-doubling route to chaos, and as a model of natural processes. In this paper we present a study of the stochastic process described by iterations of the logistic map with a random parameter. In addition to bringing together previously known results, we present a proof that the unique invariant measure of the process in the chaotic regime is asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for stochastic T-monotone parabolic obstacle problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to investigate the existence of ergodic invariant measures and its uniqueness, associated with obstacle problems governed by a T-monotone operator defined on Sobolev spaces and driven by a multiplicative noise in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with homogeneous boundary conditions. We show that the solution defines a Markov-Feller semigroup defined on the space of real bounded continuous functions of a convex subset related to the obstacle and we prove the existence of ergodic invariant measures and its uniqueness, under suitable assumptions. Our method relies on a combination of "Krylov Bogoliubov theorem", "Krein Milman theorem" and Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities to control the reflection measure.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear systems with contextual uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Validating and controlling safety-critical systems in uncertain environments necessitates probabilistic reachable sets of future state evolutions. The existing methods of computing probabilistic reachable sets normally assume that stochastic uncertainties are independent of system states, inputs, and other environment variables. However, this assumption falls short in many real-world applications, where the probability distribution governing uncertainties depends on these variables, referred to as contextual uncertainties. This paper addresses the challenge of computing probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear states with contextual uncertainties by seeking minimum-volume polynomial sublevel sets with contextual chance constraints. The formulated problem cannot be solved by the existing sample-based approximation method since the existing methods do not consider conditional probability densities. To address this, we propose a consistent sample approximation of the original problem by leveraging conditional density estimation and resampling. The obtained approximate problem is a tractable optimization problem. Additionally, we prove the proposed sample-based approximation's almost uniform convergence, showing that it gives the optimal solution almost consistently with the original ones. Through a numerical example, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing approaches, highlighting its capability to significantly reduce the bias inherent in sample-based approximation without considering a conditional probability density.</description>

      <title>ResKoopNet: Learning Koopman Representations for Complex Dynamics with Spectral Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing long-term behaviors in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging, with the Koopman operator framework providing a powerful global linearization approach, though existing methods for approximating its spectral components often suffer from theoretical limitations and reliance on predefined dictionaries. While Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) introduced the spectral residual to assess the accuracy of Koopman operator approximation, its only filters precomputed spectra, which prevents it from fully discovering the Koopman operator's complete spectral information (a limitation sometimes referred to as the 'spectral inclusion' problem). We introduce ResKoopNet (Residual-based Koopman-learning Network), a novel method that addresses this limitation by explicitly minimizing the spectral residual to compute Koopman eigenpairs, which can identify a more precise and complete spectrum of the Koopman operator. This approach provides theoretical guarantees while maintaining computational adaptability through a neural network implementation. Experiments on physical and biological systems demonstrate ResKoopNet's superior accuracy in spectral approximation compared to existing methods, particularly for systems with continuous spectra and high dimensional, which makes it as an effective tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.</description>
