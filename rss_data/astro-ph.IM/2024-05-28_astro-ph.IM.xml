      <title>The Anti-Coincidence Detector Subsystem for ComPair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ComPair is a prototype gamma-ray telescope for the development of key technologies for next-generation gamma-ray detectors consisting of four subsystems: a 10-layer double-sided silicon strip detector tracker, a cadmium zinc telluride calorimeter, a cesium iodide calorimeter, and a plastic anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The ACD acts as an active shield to veto charged particle events and consists of 5 plastic scintillating panels. ComPair was launched as a balloon payload from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico and completed a 6-hour flight on August 27, 2023. Here we detail the design adn calibration of the ComPair ACD, and report on the ACD's veto efficiency and other performance metrics during the ComPair fight.</description>

      <title>Transmission grating arrays for the X-ray spectrometer on Arcus Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arcus Probe mission concept has been submitted as an Astrophysics Probe Explorer candidate. It features two co-aligned high-resolution grating spectrometers: one for the soft x-ray band and one for the far UV. Together, these instruments can provide unprecedented performance to address important key questions about the structure and dynamics of our universe across a large range of length scales. The X-ray Spectrometer (XRS) consists of four parallel optical channels, each featuring an x-ray telescope with a fixed array of 216 lightweight, high-efficiency blazed transmission gratings, and two CCD readout arrays. Average spectral resolving power $\lambda/\Delta \lambda &gt; 2,500$ ($\sim 3500$ expected) across the 12-50 \AA \ band and combined effective area $&gt; 350$ cm$^2$ ($&gt; 470$ cm$^2$ expected) near OVII wavelengths are predicted, based on the measured x-ray performance of spectrometer prototypes and detailed ray trace modeling. We describe the optical and structural design of the grating arrays, from the macroscopic grating petals to the nanoscale gratings bars, grating fabrication, alignment, and x-ray testing. Recent x-ray diffraction efficiency results from chemically thinned grating bars are presented and show performance above mission assumptions.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of self-generated RFI using ASKAP's phased array feeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the effects of radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation on a radio telescope's sensitivity and beam pattern. It specifically explores the impact of subspace-projection mitigation on the phased array feed (PAF) beams of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The goal is to demonstrate ASKAP's ability to make science observations during active RFI mitigation. The target interfering signal is a self-generated clock signal from the digital receivers of ASKAP's PAFs. This signal is stationary, so we apply the mitigation projection to the beamformer weights at the beginning of the observation and hold them fixed. We suppressed the unwanted narrowband signal by 31dB, to the noise floor of an 880s integration on one antenna, with a typical degradation in sensitivity of just 1.5%. Sensitivity degradation over the whole 36 antenna array of 3.1% was then measured via interferometric assessment of system equivalent flux density (SEFD). These measurements are in line with theoretical calculation of noise increase using the correlation of the beam weights and RFI spatial signature. Further, degradation to the main beam's gain is 0.4% on average at the half-power point, with no significant change to the gain in the first sidelobe and no variation during extended observations; also consistent with our modelling. In summary, we present the first demonstration of mitigation via spatial nulling with PAFs on a large aperture synthesis array telescope and assess impact on sensitivity and beam shape via SEFD and holography measurements. The mitigation introduces smaller changes to sensitivity than intrinsic sensitivity differences between beams, does not preclude high dynamic range imaging and, in continuum 1MHz mode, recovers an otherwise corrupted holography beam map and usable astronomical source correlations in the RFI-affected channel.</description>

      <title>Cross-Matching of OGLE, GAIA, and Hubble Catalogs: Evaluating the Probability of Resolving Lens Stars in Microlensing Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study commenced by cross-matching data from the GAIA and OGLE telescopes with the aim of resolving the source star, long after microlensing is finished. The aim is breaking degeneracy between parameters of the microlensing equation, and ultimately calculating the mass of lens. We have examined different catalogs and found no evidence. Subsequently, employing the Monte Carlo method and guided by sensible assumptions, we embarked a simulation to discern the distribution of angular separation and to probe the feasibility of detecting this phenomenon. The results revealed that a mere 0.029% of gravitational microlensing events exhibited separations exceeding 50 milliarcseconds. Consequently, the likelihood of observing this phenomenon utilizing the OGLE and GAIA telescopes appears exceedingly far available. However, it is worth noting that instruments with very high angular resolution in the range of several tens of milliarcseconds present a viable avenue for such observations. Finally, we proposed 60 microlensing events for which the observation of separation is more probable based on the measured proper velocity.</description>

      <title>An Optical Daytime Astronomy Pathfinder for the Huntsman Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing stars and satellites in optical wavelengths during the day (optical daytime astronomy) has begun a resurgence of interest. The recent dramatic dimming event of Betelgeuse has spurred interest in continuous monitoring of the brightest variable stars, even when an object is only visible during the day due to their proximity to the Sun. In addition, an exponential increase in the number of satellites being launched into low Earth orbit in recent years has driven an interest in optical daytime astronomy for the detection and monitoring of satellites in space situational awareness (SSA) networks. In this paper we explore the use of the Huntsman Telescope as an optical daytime astronomy facility, by conducting an exploratory survey using a pathfinder instrument. We find that an absolute photometric accuracy between 1 - 10% can be achieved during the day, with a detection limit of V band 4.6 mag at midday in sloan g and r wavelengths. In addition we characterise the daytime sky brightness, colour and observing conditions in order to achieve the most reliable and highest signal-to-noise observations within the limitations of the bright sky background. We undertake a 7 month survey of the brightness of Betelgeuse during the day and demonstrate that our results are in agreement with measurements from other observatories. Finally we present our preliminary results that demonstrate obtaining absolute photometric measurements of the International Space Station during the day.</description>

      <title>The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves, can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2 architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves 3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.</description>

      <title>The Final Frontier for Proton Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental concept to search for proton decay. Using paleo-detectors, ancient minerals acquired from deep underground which can hold traces of charged particles, it may be possible to conduct a search for $p \to \bar{\nu} K^+$ via the track produced at the endpoint of the kaon. Such a search is not possible on Earth due to large atmospheric-neutrino-induced backgrounds. However, the Moon offers a reprieve from this background, since the conventional component of the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino flux at the Moon is significantly suppressed due to the Moon's lack of atmosphere. For a 100 g, $10^9$ year old (100 kton$\cdot$year exposure) sample of olivine extracted from the Moon, we expect about 0.5 kaon endpoints due to neutrino backgrounds, including secondary interactions. If such a lunar paleo-detector sample can be acquired and efficiently analyzed, proton decay sensitivity exceeding $\tau_p\sim10^{34}$ years may be achieved, competitive with Super-Kamiokande's current published limit ($\tau_p&gt;5.9\times 10^{33}$ years at 90% CL) and the projected reach of DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande in the $p \to \bar{\nu} K^+$ channel. This concept is clearly futuristic, not least since it relies on extracting mineral samples from a few kilometers below the surface of the Moon and then efficiently scanning them for kaon endpoint induced crystal defects with sub-micron-scale resolution. However, the search for proton decay is in urgent need of a paradigm shift, and paleo-detectors could provide a promising alternative to conventional experiments.</description>

      <title>Anomaly distinguishability in an asteroid analogue using quasi-monostatic experimental radar measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study conducts a quantitative distinguishability analysis using quasi-monostatic experimental radar data to find a topographic and backpropagated tomographic reconstruction for an analogue of asteroid Itokawa (25143). In particular, we consider a combination of travel-time and wavefield backpropagation tomography using the time-frequency representation (TFR) and principal component analysis (PCA) approaches as filtering techniques. Furthermore, we hypothesise that the travel time of the main peaks in the signal can be projected as a topographic imaging of the analogue asteroid while also presenting a tomographic reconstruction based on the main peaks in the signal. We compare the performance of several different filtering approaches covering several noise levels and two hypothetical interior structures: homogeneous and detailed. Our results suggest that wavefield information is vital for obtaining an appropriate reconstruction quality regardless of the noise level and that different filters affect the distinguishability under different assumptions of the noise. The results also suggest that the main peaks of the measured signal can be used to topographically distinguish the signatures in the measurements, hence the interior structure of the different analogue asteroids. Similarly, a tomographic reconstruction with the main peaks of the measured signal can be used to distinguish the interior structure of the different analogue asteroids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Parity Detectors: a qubit based particle detection scheme with meV thresholds for rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of rare-event searches, such as those aimed at determining the nature of particle dark matter or in measuring fundamental neutrino properties, will benefit from particle detectors with thresholds at the meV scale, 100-1000x lower than currently available. Quantum parity detectors (QPDs) are a novel class of proposed quantum devices that use the tremendous sensitivity of superconducting qubits to quasiparticle tunneling events as their detection concept. As envisioned, phonons generated by particle interactions within a crystalline substrate cause an eventual quasiparticle cascade within a surface patterned superconducting qubit element. This process alters the fundamental charge parity of the device in a binary manner, which can be used to deduce the initial properties of the energy deposition. We lay out the operating mechanism, noise sources, and expected sensitivity of QPDs based on a spectrum of charge-qubit types and readout mechanisms and detail an R&amp;D pathway to demonstrating sensitivity to sub-eV energy deposits.</description>

      <title>How likely is the interstellar origin of CNEOS14? On the reliability of the CNEOS database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the likelihood that the CNEOS 2014-01-08 superbolide (CNEOS14) was caused by an interstellar object. This issue has remained controversial due to lack of information on the capabilities of the classified satellite sensors that recorded the fireball. We critically evaluate previous studies, specifically addressing the reliability of the CNEOS database and the associated measurement uncertainties. With proper statistical analysis of existing data and the addition of a relevant new event (the 2024 Iberian superbolide), we disprove some claims in previous work, such as: a) the existence of a purported correlation between CNEOS velocity errors and bolide speed; b) the presence of large velocity errors of 10-15 km/s in the CNEOS database; and c) the assertion that CNEOS14 is most likely a solar system object with a hyperbolic trajectory due to measurement errors. We present a quantitative estimate of the probability that CNEOS14 is interstellar. If its measurement errors are drawn from the same underlying distribution as the 18 calibrated events, then the probability that CNEOS14 is interstellar is 94.1%. This probability is lower than the 99.7% confidence (3-sigma) generally required to claim a scientific discovery. However, it is sufficiently high to be considered significant and, by far, the most likely explanation for the currently available empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>A new search pipeline for gravitational waves with higher-order modes using mode-by-mode filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly all template-based gravitational wave (GW) searches only include the quasi-circular quadrupolar modes of the signals in their templates. Including additional degrees of freedom in the GW templates corresponding to higher-order harmonics, orbital precession, or eccentricity is challenging because: ($i$) the size of template banks and the matched-filtering cost increases significantly with the number of degrees of freedom, $(ii)$ if these additional degrees are not included properly, the search can lose sensitivity overall (due to an increase in the rate of background triggers). Here, we focus on including aligned-spin higher harmonics in GW search templates. We use a new mode-by-mode filtering approach, where we separately filter GW strain data with three harmonics [namely $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$]. This results in an increase in the matched-filtering cost by only a factor of $3$ compared to that of a $(2,2)$-only search. We develop computationally cheap trigger-ranking statistics to optimally combine the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) timeseries from different harmonics, which ensure only physically-allowed combinations of the different harmonics are triggered on. We use an empirical template-dependent background model in our ranking statistic to account for non-Gaussian transients. In addition, we develop a tool called band eraser which specifically excises narrow time-varying noisy bands in time-frequency space (without having to excise entire time chunks in the data). New GW candidate events that we detect using our search pipeline and the details of our template banks are discussed in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Apart from higher harmonics, we expect our methodology to also be useful for cheap and optimal searches including orbital precession and eccentricity in GW waveforms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10720v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a scalable distributed imaging algorithm framework for next-generation radio telescopes, managing the Fourier transform from apertures to sky (or vice versa) with a focus on minimising memory load, data transfers, and computation. Our algorithm uses smooth window functions to isolate the influence between specific regions of spatial-frequency and image space. This allows the distribution of image data between nodes and the construction of segments of frequency space exactly when and where needed.
  The developed prototype distributes terabytes of image data across many nodes, while generating visibilities at throughput and accuracy competitive with existing software. Scaling is demonstrated to be better than cubic in problem complexity (for baseline length and field of view), reducing the risk involved in growing radio astronomy processing to large telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>R2D2 image reconstruction with model uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Design Method of an Ultra-Wideband and Easy-to-Array Magic-T: A 6-14 GHz Scaled Model for a mm/submm Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We established a design method for a Magic-T with a single-layer dielectric/metal structure suitable for both wideband and multi-element applications for millimeter and submillimeter wave imaging observations. The design method was applied to a Magic-T with a coupled-line, stubs, and single-stage impedance transformers in a frequency-scaled model (6-14 GHz) that is relatively easy to demonstrate through manufacturing and evaluation. The major problem is that using the conventional perfect matching condition for a coupled-line alone produces an impractically large width coplanar coupled-line (CPCL) to satisfy the desired bandwidth ratio. In our study, by removing this constraint and optimizing impedances utilizing a circuit simulator with high computation speed, we found a solution with a $\sim$ 180 $\rm \mu$m wide CPCL, which is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the conventional analytical solution. Furthermore, considering the effect of transition discontinuities in the transmission lines, we optimized the line length and obtained a design solution with return loss &lt; -20 dB, amplitude imbalance &lt; 0.1 dB, and phase imbalance &lt; 0.5$^\circ$ from 6.1 GHz to 14.1 GHz.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large-Volume GAGG Scintillators for use in MeV Gamma-Ray Astrophysics</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with C-series SiPM readout. The calorimeter was tested at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigated larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterized their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.</description>

      <title>Forced Measurement of Astronomical Sources at Low Signal to Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified moment matching algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures for sources with a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The proposed modifications include a method to eliminate non-physical negative pixel values and a forced single iteration with an initial guess derived from co-add measurements when iterative methods are unstable. We correct for all biases in measurements introduced by the method. We find that the proposed modifications allow the algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures in nearly 100\% of the cases, especially at low signal to noise ratio. Additionally, with a reasonable guess from co-add measurements, the algorithm measures the flux, centroid, size, shape and ellipticity with bias statistically consistent with zero. We show the proposed method allows us to measure sources seven times fainter than traditional methods when applied to images obtained from WIYN-ODI. We also present a scheme to find uncertainties in measurements when using the new method to measure astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>Identifying type II quasars at intermediate redshift with few-shot learning photometric classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to identify QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert using optical and infrared photometry. At this intermediate redshift range, most of the prominent optical emission lines in QSO2 sources (e.g. CIV1549; [OIII]4959,5008) fall either outside the wavelength range of the SDSS optical spectra or in particularly noisy wavelength ranges, making QSO2 identification challenging. Therefore, we adopted a semi-supervised machine learning approach to select candidates in the SDSS galaxy sample. Recent applications of machine learning in astronomy focus on problems involving large data sets, with small data sets often being overlooked. We developed a few-shot learning approach for the identification and classification of rare-object classes using limited training data (200 sources). The new AMELIA pipeline uses a transfer-learning based approach with decision trees, distance-based, and deep learning methods to build a classifier capable of identifying rare objects on the basis of an observational training data set. We validated the performance of AMELIA by addressing the problem of identifying QSO2s at 1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 2 using SDSS and WISE photometry, obtaining an F1-score above 0.8 in a supervised approach. We then used AMELIA to select new QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert and examined the nature of the candidates using SDSS spectra, when available. In particular, we identified a sub-population of [NeV]3426 emitters at z $\sim$ 1.1, which are highly likely to contain obscured AGNs. We used X-ray and radio cross-matching to validate our classification and investigated the performance of photometric criteria from the literature showing that our candidates have an inherent dusty nature. Finally, we derived physical properties for our QSO2 sample using photoionisation models and verified the AGN classification using an SED fitting.</description>

      <title>21 cm Intensity Mapping with the DSA-2000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping is a promising probe of the universe's large-scale structure. We explore the sensitivity of the DSA-2000, a forthcoming array consisting of over 2000 dishes, to the statistical power spectrum of neutral hydrogen's 21 cm emission line. These measurements would reveal the distribution of neutral hydrogen throughout the near-redshift universe without necessitating resolving individual sources. The success of these measurements relies on the instrument's sensitivity and resilience to systematics. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at z=0.5 and across power spectrum modes of 0.03-35.12 h/Mpc with 0.1 h/Mpc resolution. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). Finally, we present a qualitative discussion of the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Advanced Sentinel-2 Analysis Through a Simplified Computation of Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sentinel-2 (S2) mission from the European Space Agency's Copernicus program provides essential data for Earth surface analysis. Its Level-2A products deliver high-to-medium resolution (10-60 m) surface reflectance (SR) data through the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). To enhance the accuracy and comparability of SR data, adjustments simulating a nadir viewing perspective are essential. These corrections address the anisotropic nature of SR and the variability in sun and observation angles, ensuring consistent image comparisons over time and under different conditions. The $c$-factor method, a simple yet effective algorithm, adjusts observed S2 SR by using the MODIS BRDF model to achieve Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Despite the straightforward application of the $c$-factor to individual images, a cohesive Python framework for its application across multiple S2 images and Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) from cloud-stored data has been lacking. Here we introduce sen2nbar, a Python package crafted to convert S2 SR data to NBAR, supporting both individual images and ESDCs derived from cloud-stored data. This package simplifies the conversion of S2 SR data to NBAR via a single function, organized into modules for efficient process management. By facilitating NBAR conversion for both SAFE files and ESDCs from SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), sen2nbar is developed as a flexible tool that can handle diverse data format requirements. We anticipate that sen2nbar will considerably contribute to the standardization and harmonization of S2 data, offering a robust solution for a diverse range of users across various applications. sen2nbar is an open-source tool available at https://github.com/ESDS-Leipzig/sen2nbar.</description>

      <title>The 18 May 2024 superbolide over the Iberian Peninsula: USG space sensors and ground-based independent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 89.8$\pm$0.4 cm, with a density of 1660 kg/m$^{3}$, entering the atmosphere at 41.6 km/s$^{1}$ with an angle of 10.9$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 138 km and ended at an altitude of 54 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit was characterized by an inclination of 15.4$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.965, a semi-major axis of 3 au, and a notably short perihelion distance of 0.11 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the U.S. Government (USG) space sensors. Our analysis shows a relatively good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 1$^\circ$ and 1.2 km/s$^{1}$, respectively. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile. The inferred bulk density and aerodynamic strength of the meteoroid from the flight model are compatible with the properties recently measured for sample-returned materials from asteroid Bennu. The physical properties and the orbital results suggest that this meteoroid originated from a recent disruption of a comet, indicating the existence of hazardous meter-sized projectiles arriving on Earth from objects formed in the distant regions of the Solar System.</description>
