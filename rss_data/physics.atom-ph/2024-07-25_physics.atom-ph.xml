      <title>Multiphoton dressed Rydberg excitations in a microwave cavity with ultracold Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magneto-optical trap loss spectroscopy of Rydberg excited $^{85}$Rb ($66\leq n \leq 68~S_{1/2}$) atoms, placed inside a tailored microwave cavity. The cavity frequency at 13.053 GHz is in resonance with the $67S_{1/2} \rightarrow 66P_{3/2}$ transition, inducing a ladder multiphoton microwave Rydberg absorption and emission. The observed spectra are modeled with an extended Jaynes-Cumming formalism that accounts for multiphoton absorption from and emission into the cavity, the loss from the trap due to Rydberg excitation, and cavity imperfection. We calculate the average photons in each spectral feature and find evidence for fractional photon emission into the cavity modes. The microwave cavity Rydberg spectroscopy in this work should inform the application and technology development of Rydberg based sensors and hybrid Rydberg atom-superconducting resonator quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Changing the paradigm in f-containing cold molecules: the impact of spin-orbit coupling and f-d transitions on quasi-bound vibrational states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present-day state-of-the-art ab initio many-body calculations on f-block containing cold molecules heavily focus on perturbative approaches for spin-orbit coupling and exclude a substantial part of the atomic transitions in the $f$- and $d$-shell. Here, we demonstrate the cruciality of a proper relativistic treatment of the $f$- and $d$-shell in Yb-containing diatomics and the inclusion of $f\rightarrow d$ transitions to obtain physically sound elastic scatterings and pre-dissociation lifetimes. We focus on state-of-the-art relativistic many-body calculations for the Yb atom's ground- and excited-state and the YbLi$^+$ potential energy surface. For that purpose, we exploit various quantum many-body methods, namely a spin-free and four-component implementation of the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) model and its equation of motion extensions, spin-free complete active space self-consistent field, and internally contracted multi-reference (MR) configuration interaction approaches, and spin-free MRCCSD with a perturbative and full triples correction. We oppose scalar relativistic calculations to four-component variants to support the reliability of our EOM-CCSD study and shed new light on the interplay between these systems' spin-orbit coupling and the proper treatment of relativistic effects. Most importantly, we observe a significant shift in the electronic spectra of the $f\rightarrow d$ excitation block. We also provide new reference potential energy surfaces for ground and excited states for which theoretically sound elastic scattering and pre-dissociation lifetimes are calculated.</description>

      <title>Continuously Expanding the Response Frequency of Rydberg Atom-Based Microwave Sensor by Using Quantum Mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave electric (MW) field measurements utilizing Rydberg atoms have witnessed significant advancements, achieving remarkable sensitivity, albeit limited to discrete MW frequencies resonant with Rydberg states. Recently, various continuous-frequency measurement schemes have emerged. However, when the MW detuning surpasses 1 GHz, the sensitivity degrades by over an order of magnitude compared to resonant measurements. In this paper, we successfully extend the response frequency range by harnessing a controlled driving field in conjunction with a quantum mixer and heterodyne technology, theoretically enabling infinite scalability. Notably, second-order effects stemming from quantum mixing necessitate careful consideration to ensure accurate electric field measurements. In addition, compared to resonant measurements, the sensitivity decline for far-detuned MW fields exceeding 1 GHz is less than twice, representing a significant improvement of several orders of magnitude over alternative schemes. Furthermore, the sensitivity of far-detuned MW fields can be efficiently enhanced by augmenting the intensity and frequency of the controlled field. For detunings ranging from 100 MHz to 2 GHz, we present optimal sensitivity values and the corresponding methods to achieve them. Our findings pave the way for Rydberg atom-based MW receivers characterized by both high sensitivity and an exceptionally broad bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of orientation averages and its application to molecular physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular physics, it is often necessary to average over the orientation of molecules when calculating observables, in particular when modelling experiments in the liquid or gas phase. Evaluated in terms of Euler angles, this is closely related to integration over two- or three-dimensional unit spheres, a common problem discussed in numerical analysis. The computational cost of the integration depends significantly on the quadrature method, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial for the feasibility of simulations. After reviewing several classes of spherical quadrature methods in terms of their efficiency and error distribution, we derive guidelines for choosing the best quadrature method for orientation averages and illustrate these with three examples from chiral molecule physics. While Gauss quadratures allow for achieving numerically exact integration for a wide range of applications, other methods offer advantages in specific circumstances. Our guidelines can also by applied to higher-dimensional spherical domains and other geometries. We also present a Python package providing a flexible interface to a variety of quadrature methods.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on Lorentz violation from composite-pulse Ramsey spectroscopy in a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In attempts to unify the four known fundamental forces in a single quantum-consistent theory, it is suggested that Lorentz symmetry may be broken at the Planck scale. Here we search for Lorentz violation at the low-energy limit by comparing orthogonally oriented atomic orbitals in a Michelson-Morley-type experiment. We apply a robust radiofrequency composite pulse sequence in the $^2F_{7/2}$ manifold of an Yb$^+$ ion, extending the coherence time from 200 $\mu$s to more than 1 s. In this manner, we fully exploit the high intrinsic susceptibility of the $^2F_{7/2}$ state and take advantage of its exceptionally long lifetime. We match the stability of the previous best Lorentz symmetry test nearly an order of magnitude faster and improve the constraints on the symmetry breaking coefficients to the 10$^{-21}$ level. These results represent the most stringent test of this type of Lorentz violation. The demonstrated method can be further extended to ion Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit gates and Schr\"odinger cat states in an optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.</description>
