      <title>Efficient Parameter Calibration of Numerical Weather Prediction Models via Evolutionary Sequential Transfer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The configuration of physical parameterization schemes in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of the forecast. However, existing parameter calibration methods typically treat each calibration task as an isolated optimization problem. This approach suffers from prohibitive computational costs and necessitates performing iterative searches from scratch for each task, leading to low efficiency in sequential calibration scenarios. To address this issue, we propose the SEquential Evolutionary Transfer Optimization (SEETO) algorithm driven by the representations of the meteorological state. First, to accurately measure the physical similarity between calibration tasks, a meteorological state representation extractor is introduced to map high-dimensional meteorological fields into latent representations. Second, given the similarity in the latent space, a bi-level adaptive knowledge transfer mechanism is designed. At the solution level, superior populations from similar historical tasks are reused to achieve a "warm start" for optimization. At the model level, an ensemble surrogate model based on source task data is constructed to assist the search, employing an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically balance the contributions of source domain knowledge and target domain data. Extensive experiments across 10 distinct calibration tasks, which span varying source-target similarities, highlight SEETO's superior efficiency. Under a strict budget of 20 expensive evaluations, SEETO achieves a 6% average improvement in Hypervolume (HV) over two state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, to match SEETO's performance at this stage, the comparison algorithms would require an average of 64% and 28% additional evaluations, respectively. This presents a new paradigm for the efficient and accurate automated calibration of NWP model parameters.</description>

      <title>Coupled Diffusion-Encoder Models for Reconstruction of Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven flow-field reconstruction typically relies on autoencoder architectures that compress high-dimensional states into low-dimensional latent representations. However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.</description>

      <title>Exploiting DINOv3-Based Self-Supervised Features for Robust Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic medical image segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging in few-shot scenarios due to the scarcity of annotated training data. Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation. Code and data will be made available on https://github.com/apple1986/DINO-AugSeg.</description>

      <title>Influence of Local Icosahedral Short-Range Order on the Magnetization Dynamics of Amorphous Cobalt-Iron Nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of soft magnetic properties in amorphous alloys is fundamentally linked to the interplay between local topological disorder and magnetic exchange interactions. In this work, we employ a multiscale Spin-Lattice Dynamics (SLD) approach to investigate the magnetostructural correlations in amorphous Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ nanodisks ($x=35, 50, 65$). By integrating classical molecular dynamics with a generalized magnetic Hamiltonian, we capture the dynamic feedback loop between lattice vibrations and spin precession. Topological analysis via Voronoi tessellation reveals a persistent species-dependent structural heterogeneity: Cobalt atoms preferentially adopt "solid-like" icosahedral packing, forming a rigid structural backbone, whereas Iron atoms exhibit a higher propensity for "liquid-like" disordered environments. We demonstrate that this topological disparity dictates the macroscopic magnetic response. The Cobalt-driven structural stiffness preserves a robust exchange network that maximizes saturation magnetization, while the local disorder inherent to Iron-rich regions introduces exchange fluctuations that act as an intrinsic damping mechanism, delaying magnetic relaxation. These findings provide an atomistic explanation for the stability of ferromagnetic order in Co-Fe metallic glasses and offer a pathway for tuning damping parameters in amorphous spintronic devices through stoichiometric control.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Material Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08044v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials, with symmetrical and periodic structures, exhibit a wide spectrum of properties and have been widely used in numerous applications across electronics, energy, and beyond. For crystalline materials discovery, traditional experimental and computational approaches are time-consuming and expensive. In these years, thanks to the explosive amount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to data-driven materials discovery. Particularly, recent advancements have exploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the highly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new avenues for fast and accurate materials discovery. These works typically focus on four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction, crystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and accelerating theoretical computations. Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a lack of systematic investigation to summarize their distinctions and limitations. To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made in recent years. We first introduce several data representations of the crystalline materials. Based on the representations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and their tailored usages in various material discovery tasks. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges and propose future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1001.4002v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of floating bipolar electrodes in copper electro-winning cells represents an emerging technology that promises economic and operational impacts. This thesis presents EWCellCAD, a computational tool designed for the simulation and analysis of these electrochemical systems. Based on the generalization and optimization of an existing 2D finite difference model for calculating electrical variables in rectangular cells, EWCellCAD implements a new 3D model capable of processing complex geometries, not necessarily rectangular, which also accelerates calculations by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, a new analytical method for estimating potentials in floating electrodes is introduced, overcoming the inaccuracies of previous heuristic approaches. The analysis of the results is supported by an interactive visualization technique of three-dimensional vector fields as flow lines.</description>
