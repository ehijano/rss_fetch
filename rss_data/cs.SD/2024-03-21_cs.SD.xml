      <title>Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models across diverse tasks, their complexity poses challenges for interpretation. This challenge is particularly evident for audio signals, where conveying interpretations becomes inherently difficult. To address this issue, we introduce Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method that generates faithful and listenable interpretations. L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions of the input audio. We train the decoder with a special loss that maximizes the confidence of the classifier decision on the masked-in portion of the audio while minimizing the probability of model output for the masked-out portion. Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Frequency-aware convolution for sound event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sound event detection (SED), convolution neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to extract time-frequency patterns from the input spectrogram. However, features extracted by CNN can be insensitive to the shift of time-frequency patterns along the frequency axis. To address this issue, frequency dynamic convolution (FDY) has been proposed, which applies different kernels to different frequency components. Compared to the vannila CNN, FDY requires several times more parameters. In this paper, a more efficient solution named frequency-aware convolution (FAC) is proposed. In FAC, frequency-positional information is encoded in a vector and added to the input spectrogram. To match the amplitude of input, the encoding vector is scaled adaptively and channel-independently. Experiments are carried out in the context of DCASE 2022 task 4, and the results demonstrate that FAC can achieve comparable performance to that of FDY with only 515 additional parameters, while FDY requires 8.02 million additional parameters. The ablation study shows that scaling the encoding vector adaptively and channel-independently is critical to the performance of FAC.</description>

      <title>Onset and offset weighted loss function for sound event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a typical sound event detection (SED) system, the existence of a sound event is detected at a frame level, and consecutive frames with the same event detected are combined as one sound event. The median filter is applied as a post-processing step to remove detection errors as much as possible. However, detection errors occurring around the onset and offset of a sound event are beyond the capacity of the median filter. To address this issue, an onset and offset weighted binary cross-entropy (OWBCE) loss function is proposed in this paper, which trains the DNN model to be more robust on frames around (a) onsets and offsets. Experiments are carried out in the context of DCASE 2022 task 4. Results show that OWBCE outperforms BCE when different models are considered. For a basic CRNN, relative improvements of 6.43% in event-F1, 1.96% in PSDS1, and 2.43% in PSDS2 can be achieved by OWBCE.</description>

      <title>Building speech corpus with diverse voice characteristics for its prompt-based representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-to-speech synthesis, the ability to control voice characteristics is vital for various applications. By leveraging thriving text prompt-based generation techniques, it should be possible to enhance the nuanced control of voice characteristics. While previous research has explored the prompt-based manipulation of voice characteristics, most studies have used pre-recorded speech, which limits the diversity of voice characteristics available. Thus, we aim to address this gap by creating a novel corpus and developing a model for prompt-based manipulation of voice characteristics in text-to-speech synthesis, facilitating a broader range of voice characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method to build a sizable corpus pairing voice characteristics descriptions with corresponding speech samples. This involves automatically gathering voice-related speech data from the Internet, ensuring its quality, and manually annotating it using crowdsourcing. We implement this method with Japanese language data and analyze the results to validate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we propose a construction method of the model to retrieve speech from voice characteristics descriptions based on a contrastive learning method. We train the model using not only conservative contrastive learning but also feature prediction learning to predict quantitative speech features corresponding to voice characteristics. We evaluate the model performance via experiments with the corpus we constructed above.</description>

      <title>Advanced Long-Content Speech Recognition With Factorized Neural Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two novel approaches, which integrate long-content information into the factorized neural transducer (FNT) based architecture in both non-streaming (referred to as LongFNT ) and streaming (referred to as SLongFNT ) scenarios. We first investigate whether long-content transcriptions can improve the vanilla conformer transducer (C-T) models. Our experiments indicate that the vanilla C-T models do not exhibit improved performance when utilizing long-content transcriptions, possibly due to the predictor network of C-T models not functioning as a pure language model. Instead, FNT shows its potential in utilizing long-content information, where we propose the LongFNT model and explore the impact of long-content information in both text (LongFNT-Text) and speech (LongFNT-Speech). The proposed LongFNT-Text and LongFNT-Speech models further complement each other to achieve better performance, with transcription history proving more valuable to the model. The effectiveness of our LongFNT approach is evaluated on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech corpora, and obtains relative 19% and 12% word error rate reduction, respectively. Furthermore, we extend the LongFNT model to the streaming scenario, which is named SLongFNT , consisting of SLongFNT-Text and SLongFNT-Speech approaches to utilize long-content text and speech information. Experiments show that the proposed SLongFNT model achieves relative 26% and 17% WER reduction on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech respectively while keeping a good latency, compared to the FNT baseline. Overall, our proposed LongFNT and SLongFNT highlight the significance of considering long-content speech and transcription knowledge for improving both non-streaming and streaming speech recognition systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UTDUSS, the UTokyo-SaruLab system submitted to Interspeech2024 Speech Processing Using Discrete Speech Unit Challenge. The challenge focuses on using discrete speech unit learned from large speech corpora for some tasks. We submitted our UTDUSS system to two text-to-speech tracks: Vocoder and Acoustic+Vocoder. Our system incorporates neural audio codec (NAC) pre-trained on only speech corpora, which makes the learned codec represent rich acoustic features that are necessary for high-fidelity speech reconstruction. For the acoustic+vocoder track, we trained an acoustic model based on Transformer encoder-decoder that predicted the pre-trained NAC tokens from text input. We describe our strategies to build these models, such as data selection, downsampling, and hyper-parameter tuning. Our system ranked in second and first for the Vocoder and Acoustic+Vocoder tracks, respectively.</description>

      <title>TDT-KWS: Fast And Accurate Keyword Spotting Using Token-and-duration Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing an efficient keyword spotting (KWS) system that delivers exceptional performance on resource-constrained edge devices has long been a subject of significant attention. Existing KWS search algorithms typically follow a frame-synchronous approach, where search decisions are made repeatedly at each frame despite the fact that most frames are keyword-irrelevant. In this paper, we propose TDT-KWS, which leverages token-and-duration Transducers (TDT) for KWS tasks. We also propose a novel KWS task-specific decoding algorithm for Transducer-based models, which supports highly effective frame-asynchronous keyword search in streaming speech scenarios. With evaluations conducted on both the public Hey Snips and self-constructed LibriKWS-20 datasets, our proposed KWS-decoding algorithm produces more accurate results than conventional ASR decoding algorithms. Additionally, TDT-KWS achieves on-par or better wake word detection performance than both RNN-T and traditional TDT-ASR systems while achieving significant inference speed-up. Furthermore, experiments show that TDT-KWS is more robust to noisy environments compared to RNN-T KWS.</description>

      <title>KunquDB: An Attempt for Speaker Verification in the Chinese Opera Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to promote Chinese opera research in both musical and speech domains, with a primary focus on overcoming the data limitations. We introduce KunquDB, a relatively large-scale, well-annotated audio-visual dataset comprising 339 speakers and 128 hours of content. Originating from the Kunqu Opera Art Canon (Kunqu yishu dadian), KunquDB is meticulously structured by dialogue lines, providing explicit annotations including character names, speaker names, gender information, vocal manner classifications, and accompanied by preliminary text transcriptions. KunquDB provides a versatile foundation for role-centric acoustic studies and advancements in speech-related research, including Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV). Beyond enriching opera research, this dataset bridges the gap between artistic expression and technological innovation. Pioneering the exploration of ASV in Chinese opera, we construct four test trials considering two distinct vocal manners in opera voices: stage speech (ST) and singing (S). Implementing domain adaptation methods effectively mitigates domain mismatches induced by these vocal manner variations while there is still room for further improvement as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Vibration Sensitivity of one-port and two-port MEMS microphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) microphones (mics) with two acoustic ports are currently receiving considerable interest, with the promise of achieving higher directional sensitivity compared to traditional one-port architectures. However, measuring pressure differences in two-port microphones typically commands sensing elements that are softer than in one-port mics, and are therefore presumably more prone to interference from external vibration. Here we derive a universal expression for microphone sensitivity to vibration and we experimentally demonstrate its validity for several emerging two-port microphone technologies. We also perform vibration measurements on a one-port mic, thus providing a one-stop direct comparison between one-port and two-port sensing approaches. We find that the acoustically-referred vibration sensitivity of two-port MEMS mics, in units of measured acoustic pressure per external acceleration (i.e., Pascals per g), does not depend on the sensing element stiffness nor on its natural frequency. We also show that this vibration sensitivity in two-port mics is inversely proportional to frequency as opposed to the frequency independent behavior observed in one-port mics. This is confirmed experimentally for several types of microphone packages.</description>

      <title>Recursive Cross-Modal Attention for Multimodal Fusion in Dimensional Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has recently gained a lot of attention since it can leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. Most state-of-the-art methods for multimodal fusion rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature of the modalities. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial, vocal, and text modalities extracted from videos. Specifically, we propose a recursive cross-modal attention (RCMA) to effectively capture the complementary relationships across the modalities in a recursive fashion. The proposed model is able to effectively capture the inter-modal relationships by computing the cross-attention weights across the individual modalities and the joint representation of the other two modalities. To further improve the inter-modal relationships, the obtained attended features of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the cross-modal attention to refine the feature representations of the individual modalities. In addition to that, we have used Temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to capture the temporal modeling (intra-modal relationships) of the individual modalities. By deploying the TCNs as well cross-modal attention in a recursive fashion, we are able to effectively capture both intra- and inter-modal relationships across the audio, visual, and text modalities. Experimental results on validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our proposed fusion model is able to achieve significant improvement over the baseline for the sixth challenge of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild 2024 (ABAW6) competition.</description>

      <title>MusicHiFi: Fast High-Fidelity Stereo Vocoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly generate music by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then converting it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their effectiveness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth expansion, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to previous work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using both objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work. Sound examples are at https://MusicHiFi.github.io/web/.</description>

      <title>Can Whisper perform speech-based in-context learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the in-context learning abilities of the Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) models released by OpenAI. A novel speech-based in-context learning (SICL) approach is proposed for test-time adaptation, which can reduce the word error rates (WERs) with only a small number of labelled speech samples without gradient descent. Language-level adaptation experiments using Chinese dialects showed that when applying SICL to isolated word ASR, consistent and considerable relative WER reductions can be achieved using Whisper models of any size on two dialects, which is on average 32.3%. A k-nearest-neighbours-based in-context example selection technique can be applied to further improve the efficiency of SICL, which can increase the average relative WER reduction to 36.4%. The findings are verified using speaker adaptation or continuous speech recognition tasks, and both achieved considerable relative WER reductions. Detailed quantitative analyses are also provided to shed light on SICL's adaptability to phonological variances and dialect-specific lexical nuances.</description>

      <title>Unimodal Aggregation for CTC-based Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper works on non-autoregressive automatic speech recognition. A unimodal aggregation (UMA) is proposed to segment and integrate the feature frames that belong to the same text token, and thus to learn better feature representations for text tokens. The frame-wise features and weights are both derived from an encoder. Then, the feature frames with unimodal weights are integrated and further processed by a decoder. Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss is applied for training. Compared to the regular CTC, the proposed method learns better feature representations and shortens the sequence length, resulting in lower recognition error and computational complexity. Experiments on three Mandarin datasets show that UMA demonstrates superior or comparable performance to other advanced non-autoregressive methods, such as self-conditioned CTC. Moreover, by integrating self-conditioned CTC into the proposed framework, the performance can be further noticeably improved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the solution to the Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) Estimation challenge, which is part of 6th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition.The EMI Estimation challenge task aims to evaluate the emotional intensity of seed videos by assessing them from a set of predefined emotion categories (i.e., "Admiration", "Amusement", "Determination", "Empathic Pain", "Excitement" and "Joy"). To tackle this challenge, we extracted rich dual-channel visual features based on ResNet18 and AUs for the video modality and effective single-channel features based on Wav2Vec2.0 for the audio modality. This allowed us to obtain comprehensive emotional features for the audiovisual modality. Additionally, leveraging a late fusion strategy, we averaged the predictions of the visual and acoustic models, resulting in a more accurate estimation of audiovisual emotional mimicry intensity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, with the average Pearson's correlation Coefficient($\rho$) across the 6 emotion dimensionson the validation set achieving 0.3288.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the VA (Valence-Arousal) estimation task in the ABAW6 competition. We devised a comprehensive model by preprocessing video frames and audio segments to extract visual and audio features. Through the utilization of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules, we effectively captured the temporal and spatial correlations between these features. Subsequently, we employed a Transformer encoder structure to learn long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's performance and generalization ability. Our method leverages a multimodal data fusion approach, integrating pre-trained audio and video backbones for feature extraction, followed by TCN-based spatiotemporal encoding and Transformer-based temporal information capture.
