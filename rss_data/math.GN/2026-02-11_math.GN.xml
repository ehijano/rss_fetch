      <title>Counting spaces of functions on separable compact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the following general problem, closely related to the problem of isomorphic classification of Banach spaces $C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on a compact space $K$, equipped with the standard supremum norm:Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a class of compact spaces. How many isomorphism types of Banach spaces $C(K)$ of real-valued continuous functions on $K$ are there, for $K\in \mathcal{K}$?
  We prove that for any uncountable regular cardinal number $\kappa$, there exist exactly $2^\kappa$ isomorphism types of spaces $C(K)$ for compact spaces of weight $\kappa$.
  We show that, for the class $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1}$ of separable compact linearly ordered spaces of weight $\omega_1$, the answer to the above question depends on additional set-theoretic axioms. In particular, assuming the continuum hypothesis, there are $2^{2^\omega}$ isomorphism types of $C(L)$, for $L\in \mathcal{L_{\omega_1}}$, and assuming a certain axiom proposed by Baumgartner, there is only one type.</description>

      <title>Total positivity in twisted flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Kac-Moody group, split over $\mathbb R$. The totally nonnegative part of $G$ and its (ordinary) flag variety $G/B^+$ was introduced by Lusztig. It is known that the totally nonnegative parts of $G$ and $G/B^+$ have remarkable combinatorial and topological properties.
  In this paper, we consider the totally nonnegative part of the $J$-twisted flag variety $G/{}^J B^+$, where ${}^J B^+$ is the Borel subgroup opposite to $B^+$ in the standard parabolic subgroup $P_J^+$ of $G$. The $J$-twisted flag varieties include the ordinary flag variety $G/B^+$ as a special case. Our main result show that the totally nonnegative part of $G/{}^J B^+$ decomposes into cells, and the closure of each cell is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Galashin-Karp-Lam \cite{GKL22} and the joint work of Bao with the first author \cite{BH24} for ordinary flag varieties.
  As an application, we deduce that the totally nonnegative part of the double flag variety $G/B^+ \times G/B^-$ with respect to the diagonal $G$-action has similar nice properties. We also establish some connections between the totally nonnegative part of the double flag with the canonical basis of the tensor product of a lowest weight module with a highest weight module of $G$.
  As another application, we show that the link of identity in a totally nonnegative reduced double Bruhat cell of $G$ is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Hersh \cite{Her14} on the link of $U_{\geq0}^-$ and gives a positive answer to an open question of Fomin and Zelevinsky.</description>

      <title>Simple connectedness of the Ran space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09815v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space of all finite non-empty subsets of a topological space $X$, also known as the Ran space of $X$, is weakly contractible for $X$ path connected. We consider subspaces $\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n}(X)$ of the Ran space given by all subsets of $X$ of size at most $n$, and present results on their first homotopy groups. In particular, we show that the induced map $\pi_1(\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n}(X)) \to \pi_1(\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n+2}(X))$ is trivial for all positive integers $n$, and even more, show that $\pi_1(\mathrm{Ran}_{\leqslant n}(X)) = 0$ for all $n\geqslant 4$, by explicitly drawing the path homotopies that contract any loop to a point.</description>

      <title>About the space of continuous functions with open domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09437v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will see how to define the metric $\beta$, which turns the topological space of continuous functions whose domains are open subsets of a locally compact and second countable space $X$ to values in a polish space $Y$, called $(C_{od}(X,Y),\tau_{\iota,D})$ into a polish space. In particular, we will present a metric for the inverse semigroup of homeomorphisms of a locally compact, Hausdorff, and second-countable space.</description>
