      <title>Spontaneous symmetry-breaking in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on star graphs with inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a three-edge star graph, where each edge contains a linear localized inhomogeneity in the form of a Dirac delta linear potential. Such systems are of significant interest in studying wave propagation in networked structures, with applications in, e.g., Josephson junctions. By reducing the system to a set of finite-dimensional coupled ordinary differential equations, we derive explicit conditions for the occurrence of a symmetry-breaking bifurcation in a symmetric family of solutions. This bifurcation is shown to be of the transcritical type, and we provide a precise estimate of the bifurcation point as the propagation constant, which is directly related to the solution norm, is varied. In addition to the symmetric states, we explore non-positive definite states that bifurcate from the linear solutions of the system. These states exhibit distinct characteristics and are crucial in understanding solutions of the nonlinear system. Furthermore, we analyze the typical dynamics of unstable solutions, showing their behavior and evolution over time. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of symmetry-breaking phenomena in nonlinear systems on metric graphs and provide insights into the stability and dynamics of such solutions.</description>

      <title>Effective gain spectra vary the pulses spectrum in a mode-locked cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filters typically play a crucial role in generating solitons by strictly confirming the working wavelength in a mode-locked laser. However, we have found that the broad smoothing filter with saturable gain also helps to regulate the pulses' operating wavelength. The effective gain, formed by the original gain spectrum and filters, shifts its center based on pulse energy, thereby affecting the pulse spectrum. A virtual mode-locked cavity is established to verify this approach in simulation. The results indicate that the spectrum changes with pulse energy, leading to a wider spectrum output. Our method paves the way for further investigations of the pulse spectrum and provides a practical approach to generating pulses at specific wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Wave-number lock-in in buckled elastic structures: an analogue to parametric instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric instabilities are a known feature of periodically driven dynamic systems; at particular frequencies and amplitudes of the driving modulation, the system's quasi-periodic response undergoes a frequency lock-in, leading to a periodically unstable response. Here, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon in a purely static context. We show that the buckling patterns of an elastic beam resting on a modulated Winkler foundation display the same kind of frequency lock-in observed in dynamic systems. Through simulations and experiments, we reveal that compressed elastic strips with modulated height alternate between predictable quasi-periodic and periodic buckling modes. Our findings uncover previously unexplored analogies between structural and dynamic instabilities, highlighting how even simple elastic structures can give rise to rich and intriguing behaviors.</description>

      <title>Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electrical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an electrical all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.</description>
