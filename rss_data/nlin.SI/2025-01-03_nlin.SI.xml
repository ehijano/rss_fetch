      <title>On the discrete Kuznetsov-Ma solutions for the defocusing Ablowitz-Ladik equation with large background amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this work is on a class of solutions of the defocusing Ablowitz-Ladik lattice on an arbitrarily large background which are discrete analogs of the Kuznetsov-Ma (KM) breathers of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation. One such solution was obtained in 2019 as a byproduct of the Inverse Scattering Transform, and it was observed that the solution could be regular for certain choices of the soliton parameters, but its regularity was not analyzed in detail. This work provides a systematic investigation of the conditions on the background and on the spectral parameters that guarantee the KM solution to be non-singular on the lattice for all times. Furthermore, a novel KM-type breather solution is presented which is also regular on the lattice under the same conditions. We also employ Darboux transformations to obtain a multi-KM breather solution, and show that parameters choices exist for which a double KM breather solution is regular on the lattice. We analyze the features of these solutions, including their frequency which, when tending to 0, renders them proximal to rogue waveforms. Finally, numerical results on the stability and spatio-temporal dynamics of the single KM breathers are presented, showcasing the potential destabilization of the obtained states due to the modulational instability of their background.</description>

      <title>Full symmetric Toda system and vector fields on the group $SO_n(\R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the relation between the functions that give first integrals of full symmetric Toda system (an important Hamilton system on the space of traceless real symmetric matrices) and the vector fields on the group of orthogonal matrices: it is known that this system is equivalent to an ordinary differential equation on the orthogonal group, and we extend this observation further to its first integrals. As a by-product we describe a representation of the Lie algebra of $B^+(\R)$-invariant functions on the dual space of Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\R)$ (under the canonical Poisson structure) by vector fields on $SO_n(\R)$.</description>

      <title>Reductions and degenerate limits of Yang-Baxter maps with $3\times 3$ Lax matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise a family of quadrirational parametric Yang-Baxter maps with $3\times 3$ Lax matrices by introducing additional essential parameters. These maps preserve a prescribed Poisson structure which originates from the Sklyanin bracket. We investigate various low-dimensional reductions of this family, as well as degenerate limits with respect to the parameters that were introduced. As a result, we derive several birational Yang-Baxter maps, and we discuss some of their integrability properties. This work is part of a more general classification of Yang-Baxter maps admitting a strong $3\times 3$ Lax matrix with a linear dependence on the spectral parameter.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamics of Rogue waves, Breathers and Mixed Bound State Solutions in Spin-Orbit and Rabi Coupled Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based on an integrable model governed by four system parameters, namely, spin-orbit coupling and Rabi coupling which are constants while the other two parameters, namely the harmonic trap and scattering lengths which are time dependent, we investigate the spin orbit-Rabi coupled condensates governed by the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation. Employing Darboux transformation approach with nontrivial seed solution, we generate rogue waves, breathers, mixed rogue-dark-bright and classical dark-bright solitons. While the addition of SOC contributes to rapid oscillations in the amplitude of the rogue waves, Rabi coupling results in the appearance of stripes in the temporal direction. When the transient trap is switched on, these stripes which remain stable within the confining region, begin to overlap exponentially in the expulsive domain and eventually shrink leading to instability. We have shown that the instability arising in the rogue waves in a transient trap can be completely overcome by manipulating the scattering length through Feshbach resonance. In the case of breathers, the Rabi coupling introduces temporal stripes with single and double mode peaks around the origin while under the influence of the transient trap, the breathers get compressed and tilted. On the other hand, the amplitude of breathers which stays constant between a maxima and minima despite oscillating with time undergoes rapid fluctuations in a given spatial domain under the influence of SOC. In the case of classical dark-bright solitons, we see the flipping of dark solitons to attain positive density much similar to bright solitons under the impact of Rabi coupling. One also witnesses a 45 degree shift in the trajectory of dark and bright solitons when the transient trap is switched on. The width of the solitons widen in the confining trap while they shrink in the expulsive domain.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems, Fredholm determinants, explicit combinatorial expansions, and connection formulas for the general $q$-Painlev\'e III$_3$ tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the $q$-difference linear system corresponding to the $q$-Painlev\'e equation of type $A_7^{(1)'}$ as a Riemann-Hilbert problem on a circle. Then, we consider the Fredholm determinant built from the jump of this Riemann-Hilbert problem and prove that it satisfies bilinear relations equivalent to $P(A_7^{(1)'})$. We also find the minor expansion of this Fredholm determinant in explicit factorized form and prove that it coincides with the Fourier series in $q$-deformed conformal blocks, or partition functions of the pure $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory, including the cases with the Chern-Simons term. Finally, we solve the connection problem for these isomonodromic tau functions, finding in this way their global behavior.</description>

      <title>On the crystal limit of the q-difference sixth Painlev\'e equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence associated with the $q$-difference sixth Painlev\'e equation in the crystal limit, i.e. $q\rightarrow 0$, and show two main results. First, the limit of this generically highly transcendental mapping is shown to exist. Second, we show that the limiting map is bi-rational and describe it explicitly.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of Hietarinta's solutions of Yang-Baxter equations~:~invertible $4\times 4$ operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to examine the simulation of integrable quantum systems using quantum computers, it is crucial to first classify Yang-Baxter operators. Hietarinta was among the first to classify constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). Including the one produced by the permutation operator, he was able to construct eleven families of invertible solutions. These techniques are effective for 4 by 4 solutions, but they become difficult to use for representations with more dimensions. To get over this limitation, we use algebraic ans\"{a}tze to generate the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent way. We employ four distinct algebraic structures that, depending on the qubit representation, replicate 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families. Among the techniques are partition algebras, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and a collection of commuting operators. Using these techniques, we do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of smooth solitary waves for the modified Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions to the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. These solutions, which exist on a nonzero constant background $k$, are unique up to translation for each permissible value of $k$ and wave speed. By leveraging the Hamiltonian nature of the modified Camassa-Holm equation and employing three conserved functionals-comprising an energy and two Casimirs, we establish orbital stability through an analysis of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition. This stability pertains to perturbations of the momentum variable in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>
