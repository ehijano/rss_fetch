      <title>Localization and mobility edges in non-Hermitian continuous quasiperiodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobility edge (ME) is a fundamental concept in the Anderson localized systems, which marks the energy separating extended and localized states. Although the ME and localization phenomena have been extensively studied in non-Hermitian (NH) quasiperiodic tight-binding models, they remain limited to NH continuum systems. Here, we investigate the ME and localization properties of a one-dimensional (1D) NH quasiperiodic continuous system, which is described by a Schr{\"o}dinger equation with an imaginary vector potential and an incommensurable one-site potential. We find that the ME is located in the real spectrum and falls between the localized and extended states. Additionally, we show that under the periodic boundary condition, the energy spectrum always exhibits an open curve representing high-energy extended electronic states characterized by a non-zero integer winding number. This complex spectrum topology is closely connected with the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) observed under open boundary conditions, where the eigenstates of the bulk bands accumulate at the boundaries. Furthermore, we analyze the critical behavior of the localization transition and obtain critical potential amplitude accompanied by the universal critical exponent $\nu \simeq 1/3$. Our study provides valuable inspiration for exploring MEs and localization behaviors in NH quasiperiodic continuous systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Working Memory and a New Magic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extremely limited working memory span, typically around four items, contrasts sharply with our everyday experience of processing much larger streams of sensory information concurrently. This disparity suggests that working memory can organize information into compact representations such as chunks, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model for chunking within the framework of the synaptic theory of working memory. We showed that by selectively suppressing groups of stimuli, the network can maintain and retrieve the stimuli in chunks, hence exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding the on-the-fly organization of information in the brain that is crucial for cognition.</description>

      <title>Influence of disordered and anisotropic interactions on relaxation dynamics and propagation of correlations in tweezer arrays of Rydberg dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of irregular one- and two-dimensional arrays of Rydberg dipoles featuring spatially anisotropic interactions. Starting from a collectively polarized initial state, we map out the dynamical phase diagram and identify a crossover between regimes of regular and anomalously slow relaxation of the initial collective order, that strongly depends on both the degree of interaction disorder and anisotropy. In addition, we find the regime of slow relaxation is characterized by a sub-ballistic propagation of correlations that remained confined to short distances even at long times. To explain our findings we develop an analytic model based on decoupled clusters of interacting dipoles that goes beyond prior theoretical works and enables us to identify multiple relaxation timescales. Our findings can be relevant for a wide variety of quantum science platforms naturally featuring disordered dipolar interactions, including polar molecules, frozen Rydberg gases and NV centers.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023325 (2024)] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian Renormalization of Neural Network Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the GP in which the data sets the IR scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and enable us to identify potential universality classes in these models.</description>
