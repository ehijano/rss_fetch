      <title>Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109 dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs. Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative understanding.</description>

      <title>Holo-Artisan: A Personalized Multi-User Holographic Experience for Virtual Museums on the Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice -- for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a spoken Q\&amp;A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue, heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.</description>

      <title>\textit{adder-viz}: Real-Time Visualization Software for Transcoding Event Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras, these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the \textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a centralized repository at \href{https://github.com/ac-freeman/adder-codec-rs}{https://github.com/ac-freeman/adder-codec-rs}.</description>

      <title>A Low-Latency 3D Live Remote Visualization System for Tourist Sites Integrating Dynamic and Pre-captured Static Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various real-time methods for capturing and transmitting dynamic 3D spaces have been proposed, including those based on RGB-D cameras and volumetric capture. However, applying existing methods to outdoor tourist sites remains difficult because maintenance and aesthetic constraints limit sensor placement, and daylight variability complicates processing. We propose a system that combines multiple LiDARs and cameras for live dynamic point cloud capture, and integrates them with pre-captured static point clouds for wide-area 3D visualization. The system sustains 30 fps across wide-area scenes while keeping latency below 100 ms. To mitigate lighting inconsistencies, static point-cloud colors are automatically adjusted to current lighting. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through real-world deployment in a tourist site.</description>

      <title>Scalable Event-Based Video Streaming for Machines with MoQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC protocol draft.</description>

      <title>LLaSO: A Foundational Framework for Reproducible Research in Large Language and Speech Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open, end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong, reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models, LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset, pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.</description>

      <title>GRAFT: GRaPH and Table Reasoning for Textual Alignment -- A Benchmark for Structured Instruction Following and Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables, created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation, and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.</description>

      <title>Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Instruction-Guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer. VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a $512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at https://github.com/HiDream-ai/VAREdit.</description>
