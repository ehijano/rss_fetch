      <title>9 new M Dwarf Planet Candidates from TESS Including 5 Gas Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection of 9 new planet candidates orbiting M dwarfs, identified using an independent search and vetting pipeline applied to TESS Full-Frame Image (FFI) data from Sectors 1 to 63. Our candidates include planets as small as 1.4 $R_{\oplus}$, with orbital periods up to 20 days. Among the 9 new candidates, we identified 5 gas giants, which represent a rare and unexpected outcome of planet formation. Our findings add to the growing sample of giant planets around M dwarfs found by TESS. We discuss their follow-up potential for mass measurements through radial velocity observations and atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy. We highlight TIC 12999193.01 as a particularly unique gas giant candidate in an eccentric orbit and excellent potential for atmospheric characterisation.</description>

      <title>The largest metallicity difference in twin systems: high-precision abundance analysis of the benchmark pair Krios &amp; Kronos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims.We conduct a high-precision differential abundance analysis of the remarkable binary system HD 240429/30 (Krios and Kronos, respectively), whose difference in metallicity is one of the highest detected in systems with similar components to date (approximately 0.20 dex). A condensation temperature TC trend study was performed to search for possible chemical signatures of planet formation. In addition, other potential scenarios have been proposed to explain this disparity. Methods. Fundamental atmospheric parameters (Te f f , log g, [Fe/H], vturb) were calculated using the latest version of the FUNDPAR code employing high resolution MAROON-X spectra. We applied a full line-by-line differential technique to measure the abundances of 26 elements in both stars with equivalent widths and spectral synthesis taking advantage of the non-solar scaled opacities. Results.We found a difference in metallicity of approximately 0.230 dex, being Kronos more metal rich than Krios. The analysis encompassed the examination of the diffusion effect and primordial chemical differences, concluding that the observed chemical discrepancies in the binary system cannot be solely attributed to any of these processes. The results also shown a noticeable excess of Li by approximately 0.56 dex in Kronos, and an enhancement of refractories with respect to Krios. A photometric study with TESS data was carried out, without finding any signal of possible transiting planets around the stars. Several potential planet formation scenarios were also explored to account for the observed excess in both metallicity and lithium in Kronos. Planetary engulfment is a plausible explanation, considering the ingestion of an exceptionally large mass, approximately approximately 27.8M_Earth, but no scenario is definitively ruled out.</description>

      <title>The Prevalence of Resonance Among Young, Close-in Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple planets undergoing disk migration may be captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances with the innermost planet parked near the disk's inner edge. Subsequent dynamical evolution may disrupt these resonances, leading to the non-resonant configurations typically observed among {\it Kepler} planets that are Gyrs old. In this scenario, resonant configurations are expected to be more common in younger systems. This prediction can now be tested, thanks to recent discoveries of young planets, particularly those in stellar clusters, by NASA's {\it TESS} mission. We divided the known planetary systems into three age groups: young ($&lt;$100-Myr-old), adolescent (0.1-1-Gyr-old), and mature ($&gt;1$-Gyr-old). The fraction of neighboring planet pairs having period ratios within a few percent of a first-order commensurability (e.g.~4:3, 3:2, or 2:1) is 70$\pm$15\% for young pairs, 24$\pm$8\% for adolescent pairs, and 15$\pm$2\% for mature pairs. The fraction of systems with at least one nearly commensurable pair (either first or second-order) is 86$\pm13$\% among young systems, 38$\pm12$\% for adolescent systems, and 23$\pm3$\% for mature systems. First-order commensurabilities prevail across all age groups, with an admixture of second-order commensurabilities. Commensurabilities are more common in systems with high planet multiplicity and low mutual inclinations. Observed period ratios often deviate from perfect commensurability by $\sim$1\% even among young planets, too large to be explained by resonant repulsion with equilibrium eccentricity tides. We also find that super-Earths in the radius gap ($1.5-1.9R_\oplus$) are less likely to be near-resonant (11.9$\pm2.0\%$) compared to Earth-sized planets ($R_p&lt;1R_\oplus$; 25.3$\pm4.4\%$) or mini-Neptunes ($1.9R_\oplus \leq R_p&lt;2.5R_\oplus$; 14.4$\pm1.8\%$).</description>

      <title>Polar alignment of a dusty circumbinary disc -- I. Dust ring formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of dust traffic jams in polar-aligning circumbinary discs. We use 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations of both gas and dust to model an initially highly misaligned circumbinary disc around an eccentric binary. As the circumbinary disc evolves to a polar configuration (perpendicular to the binary orbital plane), the difference in the precession between the gas and dust produces dust traffic jams, which become dense dust rings. We find the formation of dust rings exists for different Stokes number, binary eccentricity, and initial disc tilt. Dust rings are only produced while the circumbinary disc is misaligned to the binary orbital plane. When the disc becomes polar aligned, the dust rings are still present and long-lived. Once these dust rings are formed, they drift inward. The drift timescale depends on the Stokes number. The lower the Stokes number, the faster the dust ring drifts near the inner edge of the disc. The dust rings will have an increased midplane dust-to-go ratio, which may be a favourable environment for the steaming instability to operate.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets in reflected starlight with dual-field interferometry: A case for shorter wavelengths and a fifth Unit Telescope at VLTI/Paranal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct observation of cold and temperate planets within 1 to 10 AU would be extremely valuable for uncovering their atmospheric compositions but remains a formidable challenge with current astronomical methods. Ground-based optical interferometry, capable of high angular-resolution imaging, offers a promising avenue for studying these exoplanets, complementing space-based observations. Our objective is to explore the fundamental limits of dual-field interferometry and assess its potential for characterizing exoplanets in reflected light using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We developed analytical expressions to describe the performance of dual-field interferometry and integrated these with simulations of atmospheric wavefronts corrected by extreme Adaptive Optics. An analytical solution for optimal phase apodization was formulated to enhance starlight rejection when injected into a single-mode fibre. This framework was applied to determine the detectability of known exoplanets in reflected light across various wavelength bands for both the current VLTI and a proposed extended version. Our results indicate that employing shorter wavelengths improves detectability, enabling at least seven Jupiter-mass exoplanets to be observed in the J band with current VLTI's baselines. Adding new baselines with lengths beyond 200 meters significantly enhances VLTI's capabilities, increasing the number of detectable exoplanets and revealing potential habitable zone candidates such as $\tau$ Ceti e and Proxima Centauri b. To substantially improve the VLTI's exoplanet characterization capabilities, we recommend developing instrumentation at wavelengths shorter than 1$\,\mu$m, as well as the addition of a fifth Unit Telescope (UT5).</description>

      <title>Binary asteroid candidates in Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroids with companions constitute an excellent sample for studying the collisional and dynamical evolution of minor planets. The currently known binary population were discovered by different complementary techniques that produce, for the moment, a strongly biased distribution, especially in a range of intermediate asteroid sizes (approximately 20 to 100 km) where both mutual photometric events and high-resolution adaptive optic imaging are poorly efficient. A totally independent technique of binary asteroid discovery, based on astrometry, can help to reveal new binary systems and populate a range of sizes and separations that remain nearly unexplored. In this work, we describe a dedicated period detection method and its results for the Gaia DR3 data set. This method looks for the presence of a periodic signature in the orbit post-fit residuals. After conservative filtering and validation based on statistical and physical criteria, we are able to present a first sample of astrometric binary candidates, to be confirmed by other observation techniques such as photometric light curves and stellar occultations.</description>

      <title>Analytical Delta-V Approximation for Nonlinear Programming of Multi-target Rendezvous and Flyby Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an analytical Delta-V approximation of short-time transfers based on the linear relative motion and a gradient-based nonlinear programming model of multi-target rendezvous and flyby trajectories. In previous studies, the Lambert's solution is commonly used to evaluate Delta-V of short-duration transfers. In this study, to avoid the iteration process for obtaining the Lambert's solution and its gradient, the linear relative motion equations are applied to form an analytical two-point boundary value model for the near-circular orbit rendezvous problems. Although the relative motion equations are usually applicable when the two orbits are close enough, and the position and velocity errors would become more significant as the orbital differences increase, the errors of the velocity increments were proved acceptable in our simulations. Moreover, the analytical formula facilitates the calculation of the gradients to the start epoch and flight time, which are used to establish a nonlinear programming model for sequence optimization that gradient-based algorithms can easily solve. Simulation results demonstrated that the analytical Delta-V approximation requires much less calculation than the Lambert's solution, and the proposed gradient-based nonlinear programming algorithms can obtain similar results in less time than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Support for fragile porous dust in a gravitationally self-regulated disk around IM Lup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks, the birthplace of planets, are expected to be gravitationally unstable in their early phase of evolution. IM Lup, a well-known T-Tauri star, is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with spiral arms likely caused by gravitational instability. The IM Lup disk has been observed using various methods, but developing a unified explanatory model is challenging. Here we present a physical model of the IM Lup disk that offers a comprehensive explanation for diverse observations spanning from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. Our findings underscore the importance of dust fragility in retaining the observed millimeter emission and reveal the preference for moderately porous dust to explain observed millimeter polarization. We also find that the inner disk region is likely heated by gas accretion, providing a natural explanation for bright millimeter emission within 20 au. The actively heated inner region in the model casts a 100-au-scale shadow, aligning seamlessly with the near-infrared scattered light observation. The presence of accretion heating also supports the fragile dust scenario in which accretion efficiently heat the disk midplane. Due to the fragility of dust, it is unlikely that a potential embedded planet at 100 au formed via pebble accretion in a smooth disk, pointing to local dust enhancement boosting pebble accretion or alternative pathways such as outward migration or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <title>A portrait of the rotation of Ultra-Cool Dwarfs revealed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the results of a search for rotation signature in 250 Gaia DR3 Ultra-Cool Dwarfs (UCDs) with TESS light curves. We identified 71 targets with unambiguous periodicities, of which 61 present rotation signatures and a single source behavior, with periods between 0.133 and 5.81 days. Five UCDs show double-dip features, namely variations with two periods, one approximately double or half the other. The remaining ten UCDs with unambiguous variability present a likely non-single behavior. We also found 20 UCDs showing complex behavior in their light curves, with noticeable fluctuations and irregular structure, with a few exhibiting apparent changes in their temporal structure. The remaining 159 targets show noisy light curves corresponding to low-amplitude signals, whose temporal variation cannot be easily identified. The distribution of the UCDs with rotation signature in the CMD diagram points to a lack of rotating objects within about $11.5&lt;M_{G}&lt;12.5$ and $G-G_{RP}&lt;1.5$ separating them into two regimes, one mainly composed of less massive late-M stars with $P_{rot} \geq 1.0$ d, and another mainly composed of more massive early-M stars with $P_{rot}&lt;1.0$ d. It is important to emphasize that by separating stars into age intervals, one observes that UCDs with $P_{rot} \geq 1.0$ d tend to be located in regions of younger objects, and, in contrast, those with $P_{rot}&lt;1.0$ d are mainly concentrated in regions of older objects. Whether these trends of stars contrasting the sample separation is physical or produced by observational biases is a question to be verified in future studies.</description>

      <title>The Not-So Dramatic Effect of Advective Flows on Gas Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are the most common types of exoplanets discovered, yet the physics of their formation are still debated. Standard core accretion models in gas-rich environment find that typical mini-Neptune mass planets would blow up into Jupiters before the underlying disk gas dissipates away. The injection of entropy from the protoplanetary disk into forming gaseous envelopes has recently been put forward as a mechanism to delay this runaway accretion, specifically at short orbital distances. Here, we reevaluate this line of reasoning by incorporating recycling flows of gas into a numerical one-dimensional thermodynamic model with more realistic equation of state and opacities and the thermal state of the advective flow. At 0.1 AU, we find that advective flows are only able to produce mini-Neptunes if they can penetrate below ~0.25 of the planet's gravitational sphere of influence. Otherwise, the gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) reaches above ~10% which is too large to explain the measured properties of mini-Neptunes, necessitating other gas-limiting processes such as late-time core assembly. The effect of entropy advection on gas accretion weakens even further beyond 0.1 AU. We present an updated scaling relation between GCR and the penetration depth of the advective flows which varies non-trivially with orbital distances, core masses and dusty vs. dust-free opacity. We further demonstrate how measurements of planet mass distribution beyond ~1 AU using future instruments such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope could be used to disambiguate between different formation conditions of gas-poor planets.</description>

      <title>Shallower radius valley around low-mass hosts: Evidence for icy planets, collisions or high-energy radiation scatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radius valley, i.e., a dearth of planets with radii between 1.5 and 2 Earth radii, provides insights into planetary formation and evolution. Using homogenously revised planetary parameters from Kepler 1-minute short cadence light curves, we remodel transits of 72 small planets mostly orbiting low-mass stars, improving the precision and accuracy of planet parameters. By combining this sample with a similar sample of planets around higher-mass stars, we determine the depth of the radius valley as a function of stellar mass. We find that the radius valley is shallower for low-mass stars compared to their higher mass counterparts. Upon comparison, we find that theoretical models of photoevaporation under-predict the number of planets observed inside the radius valley for low-mass stars: with decreasing stellar mass, the predicted fraction of planets inside the valley remains approximately constant whereas the observed fraction increases. We argue that this provides evidence for the presence of icy planets around low-mass stars. Alternatively, planets orbiting low-mass stars undergo more frequent collisions and scatter in the stars' high-energy output may also cause planets to fill the valley. We predict that more precise mass measurements for planets orbiting low mass stars would be able to distinguish between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution during the protostellar collapse: influence on the coupling between the neutral gas and the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between the magnetic field and the gas during the collapsing phase of star-forming cores is strongly affected by the dust size distribution, which is expected to evolve. We aim to investigate the influence of key parameters on the evolution of the dust distribution as well as on the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse. We perform collapsing single zone simulations with shark. The code computes the evolution of the dust distribution, accounting for different grain growth and destruction processes. It also computes the magnetic resistivities. We find that the dust distribution significantly evolves during the protostellar collapse, shaping the magnetic resistivities. The peak size of the distribution, the population of small grains and consequently the magnetic resistivities are controlled by both coagulation and fragmentation rates. Under standard assumptions, the small grains coagulate very early as they collide by ambipolar drift, yielding magnetic resistivities orders of magnitude away from the non-evolving dust case. In particular, the ambipolar resistivity \eta_AD is very high prior to nH=10^10 cm^-3, and as a consequence magnetic braking should be ineffective. In this case, large size protoplanetary disks should result, which is inconsistent with recent observations. To alleviate this tension, we identify mechanisms to reduce the ambipolar resistivity during the protostellar collapse. The most promising are namely: electrostatic repulsion and grain-grain erosion. The evolution of the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse and consequently the shape of the magnetic field in the early life of the protoplanetary disk strongly depends on the possibility to repopulate the small grains or to prevent their early coagulation. Therefore, it is crucial to better constrain the collision outcomes and the dust grain elastic properties.</description>
