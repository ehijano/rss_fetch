      <title>Fine-Tuning Whisper for Inclusive Prosodic Stress Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prosody plays a crucial role in speech perception, influencing both human understanding and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite its importance, prosodic stress remains under-studied due to the challenge of efficiently analyzing it. This study explores fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper large-v2 ASR model to recognize phrasal, lexical, and contrastive stress in speech. Using a dataset of 66 native English speakers, including male, female, neurotypical, and neurodivergent individuals, we assess the model's ability to generalize stress patterns and classify speakers by neurotype and gender based on brief speech samples. Our results highlight near-human accuracy in ASR performance across all three stress types and near-perfect precision in classifying gender and neurotype. By improving prosody-aware ASR, this work contributes to equitable and robust transcription technologies for diverse populations.</description>

      <title>Lead Instrument Detection from Multitrack Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior approaches to lead instrument detection primarily analyze mixture audio, limited to coarse classifications and lacking generalization ability. This paper presents a novel approach to lead instrument detection in multitrack music audio by crafting expertly annotated datasets and designing a novel framework that integrates a self-supervised learning model with a track-wise, frame-level attention-based classifier. This attention mechanism dynamically extracts and aggregates track-specific features based on their auditory importance, enabling precise detection across varied instrument types and combinations. Enhanced by track classification and permutation augmentation, our model substantially outperforms existing SVM and CRNN models, showing robustness on unseen instruments and out-of-domain testing. We believe our exploration provides valuable insights for future research on audio content analysis in multitrack music settings.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Generalised Echo and Interference Cancelling and Extended Multichannel Wiener Filtering for Combined Noise Reduction and Acoustic Echo Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two algorithms for combined acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and noise reduction (NR) are analysed, namely the generalised echo and interference canceller (GEIC) and the extended multichannel Wiener filter (MWFext). Previously, these algorithms have been examined for linear echo paths, and assuming access to voice activity detectors (VADs) that separately detect desired speech and echo activity. However, algorithms implementing VADs may introduce detection errors. Therefore, in this paper, the previous analyses are extended by 1) modelling general nonlinear echo paths by means of the generalised Bussgang decomposition, and 2) modelling VAD error effects in each specific algorithm, thereby also allowing to model specific VAD assumptions. It is found and verified with simulations that, generally, the MWFext achieves a higher NR performance, while the GEIC achieves a more robust AEC performance.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Tenseness in English and Japanese Tense-Lax Vowels: A Lagrangian Model with Indicator $\theta_1$ and Force of Tenseness Ftense(t)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of vowel tenseness has traditionally been examined through the binary distinction of tense and lax vowels. However, no universally accepted quantitative definition of tenseness has been established in any language. Previous studies, including those by Jakobson, Fant, and Halle (1951) and Chomsky and Halle (1968), have explored the relationship between vowel tenseness and the vocal tract. Building on these foundations, Ishizaki (2019, 2022) proposed an indirect quantification of vowel tenseness using formant angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_{F1}$ and their first and second derivatives, $d^Z_1(t)/dt = \lim \tan \theta_1(t$) and $d^2 Z_1(t)/dt^2 = d/dt \lim \tan \theta_1(t)$. This study extends this approach by investigating the potential role of a force-related parameter in determining vowel quality. Specifically, we introduce a simplified model based on the Lagrangian equation to describe the dynamic interaction of the tongue and jaw within the oral cavity during the articulation of close vowels. This model provides a theoretical framework for estimating the forces involved in vowel production across different languages, offering new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying vowel articulation. The findings suggest that this force-based perspective warrants further exploration as a key factor in phonetic and phonological studies.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Speech Translation Systems through Targeted Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As speech translation (ST) systems become increasingly prevalent, understanding their vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring robust and reliable communication. However, limited work has explored this issue in depth. This paper explores methods of compromising these systems through imperceptible audio manipulations. Specifically, we present two innovative approaches: (1) the injection of perturbation into source audio, and (2) the generation of adversarial music designed to guide targeted translation, while also conducting more practical over-the-air attacks in the physical world. Our experiments reveal that carefully crafted audio perturbations can mislead translation models to produce targeted, harmful outputs, while adversarial music achieve this goal more covertly, exploiting the natural imperceptibility of music. These attacks prove effective across multiple languages and translation models, highlighting a systemic vulnerability in current ST architectures. The implications of this research extend beyond immediate security concerns, shedding light on the interpretability and robustness of neural speech processing systems. Our findings underscore the need for advanced defense mechanisms and more resilient architectures in the realm of audio systems.

      <title>CPT-Boosted Wav2vec2.0: Towards Noise Robust Speech Recognition for Classroom Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones and classroom conditions.</description>

      <title>SpeechCompass: Enhancing Mobile Captioning with Diarization and Directional Guidance via Multi-Microphone Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-text capabilities on mobile devices have proven helpful for hearing and speech accessibility, language translation, note-taking, and meeting transcripts. However, our foundational large-scale survey (n=263) shows that the inability to distinguish and indicate speaker direction makes them challenging in group conversations. SpeechCompass addresses this limitation through real-time, multi-microphone speech localization, where the direction of speech allows visual separation and guidance (e.g., arrows) in the user interface. We introduce efficient real-time audio localization algorithms and custom sound perception hardware running on a low-power microcontroller and four integrated microphones, which we characterize in technical evaluations. Informed by a large-scale survey (n=494), we conducted an in-person study of group conversations with eight frequent users of mobile speech-to-text, who provided feedback on five visualization styles. The value of diarization and visualizing localization was consistent across participants, with everyone agreeing on the value and potential of directional guidance for group conversations.</description>

      <title>DeePen: Penetration Testing for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes - manipulated or forged audio and video media - pose significant security risks to individuals, organizations, and society at large. To address these challenges, machine learning-based classifiers are commonly employed to detect deepfake content. In this paper, we assess the robustness of such classifiers through a systematic penetration testing methodology, which we introduce as DeePen. Our approach operates without prior knowledge of or access to the target deepfake detection models. Instead, it leverages a set of carefully selected signal processing modifications - referred to as attacks - to evaluate model vulnerabilities. Using DeePen, we analyze both real-world production systems and publicly available academic model checkpoints, demonstrating that all tested systems exhibit weaknesses and can be reliably deceived by simple manipulations such as time-stretching or echo addition. Furthermore, our findings reveal that while some attacks can be mitigated by retraining detection systems with knowledge of the specific attack, others remain persistently effective. We release all associated code.</description>
