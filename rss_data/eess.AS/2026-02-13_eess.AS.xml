      <title>SLD-L2S: Hierarchical Subspace Latent Diffusion for High-Fidelity Lip to Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although lip-to-speech synthesis (L2S) has achieved significant progress in recent years, current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on intermediate representations such as mel-spectrograms or discrete self-supervised learning (SSL) tokens. The potential of latent diffusion models (LDMs) in this task remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce SLD-L2S, a novel L2S framework built upon a hierarchical subspace latent diffusion model. Our method aims to directly map visual lip movements to the continuous latent space of a pre-trained neural audio codec, thereby avoiding the information loss inherent in traditional intermediate representations. The core of our method is a hierarchical architecture that processes visual representations through multiple parallel subspaces, initiated by a subspace decomposition module. To efficiently enhance interactions within and between these subspaces, we design the diffusion convolution block (DiCB) as our network backbone. Furthermore, we employ a reparameterized flow matching technique to directly generate the target latent vectors. This enables a principled inclusion of speech language model (SLM) and semantic losses during training, moving beyond conventional flow matching objectives and improving synthesized speech quality. Our experiments show that SLD-L2S achieves state-of-the-art generation quality on multiple benchmark datasets, surpassing existing methods in both objective and subjective evaluations.</description>

      <title>TC-BiMamba: Trans-Chunk bidirectionally within BiMamba for unified streaming and non-streaming ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) for unified streaming and non-streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR). Dynamic chunk size training enables a single model for offline decoding and streaming decoding with various latency settings. In contrast, existing BiMamba based streaming method is limited to fixed chunk size decoding. When dynamic chunk size training is applied, training overhead increases substantially. To tackle this issue, we propose the Trans-Chunk BiMamba (TC-BiMamba) for dynamic chunk size training. Trans-Chunk mechanism trains both bidirectional sequences in an offline style with dynamic chunk size. On the one hand, compared to traditional chunk-wise processing, TC-BiMamba simultaneously achieves 1.3 times training speedup, reduces training memory by 50%, and improves model performance since it can capture bidirectional context. On the other hand, experimental results show that TC-BiMamba outperforms U2++ and matches LC-BiMmaba with smaller model size.</description>

      <title>Exploring Frequency-Domain Feature Modeling for HRTF Magnitude Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate upsampling of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) from sparse measurements is crucial for personalized spatial audio rendering. Traditional interpolation methods, such as kernel-based weighting or basis function expansions, rely on measurements from a single subject and are limited by the spatial sampling theorem, resulting in significant performance degradation under sparse sampling. Recent learning-based methods alleviate this limitation by leveraging cross-subject information, yet most existing neural architectures primarily focus on modeling spatial relationships across directions, while spectral dependencies along the frequency dimension are often modeled implicitly or treated independently. However, HRTF magnitude responses exhibit strong local continuity and long-range structure in the frequency domain, which are not fully exploited. This work investigates frequency-domain feature modeling by examining how different architectural choices, ranging from per-frequency multilayer perceptrons to convolutional, dilated convolutional, and attention-based models, affect performance under varying sparsity levels, showing that explicit spectral modeling consistently improves reconstruction accuracy, particularly under severe sparsity. Motivated by this observation, a frequency-domain Conformer-based architecture is adopted to jointly capture local spectral continuity and long-range frequency correlations. Experimental results on the SONICOM and HUTUBS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of interaural level difference and log-spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>When Audio-LLMs Don't Listen: A Cross-Linguistic Study of Modality Arbitration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When audio and text conflict, speech-enabled language models follow the text 10 times more often than when arbitrating between two text sources, even when explicitly instructed to trust the audio. Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations.
  This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\% to 33\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder. Experiments across four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs and 8 languages show consistent trends with substantial cross-linguistic and cross-model variation, establishing modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension not captured by standard speech benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Musical Metamerism with Time--Frequency Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of metamerism originates from colorimetry, where it describes a sensation of visual similarity between two colored lights despite significant differences in spectral content. Likewise, we propose to call ``musical metamerism'' the sensation of auditory similarity which is elicited by two music fragments which differ in terms of underlying waveforms. In this technical report, we describe a method to generate musical metamers from any audio recording. Our method is based on joint time--frequency scattering in Kymatio, an open-source software in Python which enables GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The advantage of our method is that it does not require any manual preprocessing, such as transcription, beat tracking, or source separation. We provide a mathematical description of JTFS as well as some excerpts from the Kymatio source code. Lastly, we review the prior work on JTFS and draw connections with closely related algorithms, such as spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRF), modulation power spectra (MPS), and Gabor filterbank (GBFB).</description>

      <title>SonicSieve: Bringing Directional Speech Extraction to Smartphones Using Acoustic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30{\deg} angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>Tiny is not small enough: High-quality, low-resource facial animation models through hybrid knowledge distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven digital characters.</description>

      <title>How Does a Deep Neural Network Look at Lexical Stress in English Words?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for neural network interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Generalizable Acoustic Scene Representations via Contrastive Fine-Tuning and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) models on edge devices typically operate under fixed class assumptions, lacking the transferability needed for real-world applications that require adaptation to new or refined acoustic categories. We propose ContrastASC, which learns generalizable acoustic scene representations by structuring the embedding space to preserve semantic relationships between scenes, enabling adaptation to unseen categories without retraining. Our approach combines supervised contrastive fine-tuning of pre-trained models with contrastive representation distillation to transfer this structured knowledge to compact student models. Our evaluation shows that ContrastASC demonstrates improved few-shot adaptation to unseen categories while maintaining strong closed-set performance.</description>

      <title>Stable Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Learning Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, leading to coupled nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such systems. On the other hand, neural ordinary differential equations have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of the system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. Compared to our previous work that used multilayer perceptrons to parametrise nonlinear dynamics, we employ gradient networks that allow an interpretation in terms of a closed-form and non-negative potential required by scalar auxiliary variable techniques. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</description>

      <title>NarraScore: Bridging Visual Narrative and Musical Dynamics via Hierarchical Affective Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing coherent soundtracks for long-form videos remains a formidable challenge, currently stalled by three critical impediments: computational scalability, temporal coherence, and, most critically, a pervasive semantic blindness to evolving narrative logic. To bridge these gaps, we propose NarraScore, a hierarchical framework predicated on the core insight that emotion serves as a high-density compression of narrative logic. Uniquely, we repurpose frozen Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as continuous affective sensors, distilling high-dimensional visual streams into dense, narrative-aware Valence-Arousal trajectories. Mechanistically, NarraScore employs a Dual-Branch Injection strategy to reconcile global structure with local dynamism: a \textit{Global Semantic Anchor} ensures stylistic stability, while a surgical \textit{Token-Level Affective Adapter} modulates local tension via direct element-wise residual injection. This minimalist design bypasses the bottlenecks of dense attention and architectural cloning, effectively mitigating the overfitting risks associated with data scarcity. Experiments demonstrate that NarraScore achieves state-of-the-art consistency and narrative alignment with negligible computational overhead, establishing a fully autonomous paradigm for long-video soundtrack generation.</description>

      <title>MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer: Scaling Audio Tokenizers for Future Audio Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete audio tokenizers are fundamental to empowering large language models with native audio processing and generation capabilities. Despite recent progress, existing approaches often rely on pretrained encoders, semantic distillation, or heterogeneous CNN-based architectures. These designs introduce fixed inductive biases that limit reconstruction fidelity and hinder effective scaling. In this paper, we argue that discrete audio tokenization should be learned fully end-to-end using a homogeneous and scalable architecture. To this end, we first propose CAT (Causal Audio Tokenizer with Transformer), a purely Transformer-based architecture that jointly optimizes the encoder, quantizer, and decoder from scratch for high-fidelity reconstruction. Building on the CAT architecture, we develop MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer, a large-scale audio tokenizer featuring 1.6 billion parameters, pre-trained on 3 million hours of diverse, general audio data. We show that this simple, fully end-to-end approach built from homogeneous, causal Transformer blocks scales gracefully and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse audio domains. Across speech, sound, and music, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer consistently outperforms prior codecs over a wide range of bitrates, while exhibiting predictable improvements with increased scale. Notably, leveraging the discrete tokens from our model, we develop the first purely autoregressive TTS model that surpasses prior non-autoregressive and cascaded systems. Furthermore, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer enables competitive ASR performance without auxiliary encoders. Our findings position the CAT architecture as a unified, scalable interface for the next generation of native audio foundation models.</description>
