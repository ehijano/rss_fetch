      <title>On invariant subalgebras when the ISR property fails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all $G$-invariant von Neumann subalgebras in $L(G)$ for $G=\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. This is the first result on classifying $G$-invariant von Neumann subalgebras in $L(G)$ for i.c.c. groups $G$ without the invariant von Neumann subalgebras rigidity property (ISR property for short) as introduced in Amrutam-Jiang's work. As a corollary, we show that $L(\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes \{\pm I_2\})$ is the unique maximal Haagerup $G$-invariant von Neumann subalgebra in $L(G)$, where $I_2$ denotes the identity matrix in $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Classification of Invariant Subalgebras in a class of factors with property (T)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 2$ and $G_n=\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$. We classify all $G_n$-invariant von Neumann subalgebras in $L(G_n)$. For $n=2$, this gives an alternative proof of the previous result of Jiang-Liu. For $n\geq 3$, this gives the first class of property (T) groups without the invariant subalgebras rigidity property but invariant subalgebras in the corresponding group factors can still be classified. As a corollary, $L(G_n)$ admits a unique maximal Haagerup $G_n$-invariant von Neumann subalgebra.</description>

      <title>A Note on Pseudofinite W*-Probability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce pseudofinite W*-probability spaces. These are W*-probability spaces that are elementarily equivalent to Ocneanu ultraproducts of finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras equipped with arbitrary faithful normal states. We are particularly interested in the case where these finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras are full matrix algebras: the pseudofinite factors. We show that these are indeed factors. We see as a consequence that pseudofinite factors are never of type $\mathrm{III}_0$. Mimicking the construction of the Powers factors, we give explicit families of examples of matrix algebra ultraproducts that are $\mathrm{III}_\lambda$ factors for $\lambda \in (0,1]$. We show that these examples share their universal theories with the corresponding Powers factor and thus have uncomputable universal theories. Finally, we show that pseudofinite factors are full. This generalizes a theorem of Farah-Hart-Sherman which shows that pseudofinite tracial factors do not have property $\Gamma$. It has the consequence that hyperfinite factors of type $\mathrm{III}$ (the Powers factors) are never pseudofinite. Our proofs combine operator algebraic insights with routine continuous logic syntactic arguments: using \L os' theorem to prove that certain sentences which are true for all matrix algebras are inherited by their ultraproducts.</description>

      <title>Comparing Two Notions of Coaction Invariance of Ideals in $\mathrm{C}^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a coaction $\delta$ of a locally compact group $G$ on a $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $A$, we study the relationship between two different forms of coaction invariance of ideals of $A$ and the ideals of the corresponding crossed product $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $A \rtimes_{\delta} G$. In particular, we characterize when these two notions of invariance are equivalent.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy for Inverse-Semigroup Crossed Products via Dynamical Cuntz Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise stable finiteness and pure infiniteness of the essential crossed product of a C*-algebra by an action of an inverse semigroup. Under additional assumptions, we prove a stably finite / purely infinite dichotomy. Our main technique is the development, using an induced action, of a ''dynamical Cuntz semigroup'' that is a subquotient of the usual Cuntz semigroup. We prove that the essential crossed product is stably finite / purely infinite if and only if the dynamical Cuntz semigroup admits / does not admit a nontrivial state. Indeed, a retract of our dynamical Cuntz semigroup suffices to prove the dichotomy. Our results generalise those by Rainone on crossed products of groups acting by automorphisms of a C*-algebra, and we recover results by Kwa\'sniewski--Meyer--Prasad on C*-algebras of non-Hausdorff groupoids.</description>

      <title>Exact Fell bundles with the approximation property over inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the reduced cross-sectional algebra of a Fell bundle with the approximation property over an inverse semigroup is exact if and only if the unit fiber of the Fell bundle is exact. This generalizes a recent result of the first-named author for actions of second countable locally compact Hausdorff groupoids on separable $C^*$-algebras. Along the way, we reprove some results of Kwa\'sniewski--Meyer on Fell bundle ideals.</description>

      <title>Double Categorical Approaches to AQFT I: Axiomatic Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In operator-algebraic AQFT one routinely moves back and forth between two kinds of structure: inclusions of local algebras coming from inclusions of regions, and bimodules/intertwiners that implement the standard $L^2$-based constructions used to compare and compose observables. The obstruction to making this interplay genuinely functorial is that there are two independent compositions (restriction along inclusions and fusion/transport along bimodules) and they must be compatible on commuting spacetime diagrams, which is exactly the situation a double category is designed to encode. Part I resolves this by building a spacetime double category and a von Neumann algebra double category inspired by previous work by Orendain, and by packaging an AQFT input as a pseudo double functor whose vertical part is the Haag-Kastler net and whose squares record the required compatibilities in a well-typed way forced by commutativity. We formulate the Haag-Kastler axioms in this setup, establish the coherence needed for the construction, and work out representative examples.</description>

      <title>Adelic C*-correspondences and parabolic induction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In analogy with the construction of representations of adelic groups as restricted products of representations of local groups, we study restricted tensor products of Hilbert C*-modules and of C*-correspondences. The construction produces global C*-correspondences from compatible collections of local C*-correspondences. When applied to the collection of C*-correspondences capturing local parabolic induction, the construction produces a global C*-correspondence that captures adelic parabolic induction.</description>

      <title>Approximation by elements of finite spectra for C* Algebras of higher real rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend a well known result about real rank zero C* Algebras to higher real rank C* Algebras. The main technique used here is similar to the method in which we approximate continuous functions using projections. What we reach at the end, is similar to the fact that the self-adjoint elements of a real rank zero C* Algebra can be approximated by elements of finite spectrum. We achieve the result for the diagonal of the self-adjoint elements of A^2, where A is a real rank one C* Algebra.</description>

      <title>Injective envelopes of $C^*$-algebras as maximal rigid multiplier covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-commutative analogue of B{\l}aszczyk's elegant two-step construction of the Gleason cover: first maximise irreducibility, then compactify. The key insight is that extremal disconnectedness (respectively, injectivity) emerges naturally from a maximality principle rather than being imposed by hand.
  We work with $A$-multiplier covers: non-unital $C^*$-algebras $E$ equipped with a faithful, non-degenerate $*$-homomorphism $\iota:A\to M(E)$. Covers are ordered by $A$-preserving ucp maps between multiplier algebras in the forward direction. A cover is rigid if every ucp endomorphism of $M(E)$ fixing $A$ pointwise is the identity. We prove that if $(E_{\max},\iota_{\max})$ is maximal among rigid covers, then the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow M(E_{\max})$ is rigid and essential; consequently, \[ I(A)\ \cong\ M(E_{\max}) \] canonically over $A$ by Hamana's characterisation. In the commutative case $A=C(X)$, we recover B{\l}aszczyk's picture: for a maximal regular refinement $(X,T^\ast)$ with irreducible identity, $G(X)=\beta(X,T^\ast)$ and $I(C(X))\cong C(G(X))\cong M(C_0(U))$ for any dense cozero set $U\subseteq G(X)$ (in particular, for any dense open $F_\sigma$ set, e.g., an increasing union of clopen sets). Thus the paradigm \emph{maximise first, then compactify} provides a unified conceptual framework on both sides of Gelfand duality.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>

Abstract: Let $ (T(t))_{t\geq0} $ be a positive $C_{0}$-semigroup with generator $A$ on a C$^*$-algebra or on the predual of a W$^*$-algebra. Then the growth bound $\omega_{0}$ equals $s(A)$. If the spectrum of $A$ is not empty, then $s(A)$, the spectral bound of $A$, is a spectral value.</description>

      <title>A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we place single-mode resonators or single-orbital artificial atoms at its vertices, edges and facets, and we devise near-neighbor hopping terms derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality maps of the simplicial complex of the triangulation. Regardless of the surface or its triangulation, these terms always lead to tight-binding Hamiltonians with large and clean topological spectral gaps, carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Positive operator-valued noncommutative polynomials are squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish operator-valued versions of the earlier foundational factorization results for noncommutative polynomials due to Helton (Ann.~Math., 2002) and one of the authors (Linear Alg.~Appl., 2001). Specifically, we show that every positive operator-valued noncommutative polynomial $p$ admits a single-square factorization $p=r^{*}r$. An analogous statement holds for operator-valued noncommutative trigonometric polynomials.
  Our approach follows the now standard sum-of-squares (sos) paradigm but requires new results and constructions tailored to operator coefficients. Assuming a positive $p$ is not sos, Hahn--Banach separation yields a linear functional that is positive on the sos cone and negative on $p$; a Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction then produces a representing tuple $Y$ leading to contradiction since $p$ was assumed positive on $Y$.
  The main technical input is a canonical tuple $A$ of self-adjoint operators and, in the unitary case, a canonical tuple $U$ of unitaries, both constructed from the left-regular representation on Fock space. We prove that, up to a universal constant, the norms $\|p(A)\|$ and $\|p(U)\|$ bound the operator norm of any positive semidefinite Gram matrix $G$ representing the sos polynomial $p$. This uniform control is the key input in showing that the cone of (sums of) squares is closed in the product ultraweak topology on the coefficients. A separate approximation argument then produces a separating functional that is continuous for the weak operator topology (WOT). This two-step passage between the ultraweak and WOT topologies constitutes our separation argument and yields the required WOT closedness of the sos cone. With this in hand, the GNS construction associates to such a separating linear functional a finite-rank positive semidefinite noncommutative Hankel matrix and, on its range, produces the desired tuple $Y$.</description>
