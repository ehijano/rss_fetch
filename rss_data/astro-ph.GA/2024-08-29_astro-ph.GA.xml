      <title>Mapping the Outcomes of Stellar Evolution in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are expected to be populated by numerous stars, either formed in the outer regions of the disk via gravitational instability, or captured from the nearby nuclear star cluster. Regardless of their formation mechanism, these stars experience altered evolutionary paths, mostly shaped by the accretion of dense disk material. In this study, through the comparison of different timescales, we chart the evolutionary outcomes of these AGN stars as a function of disk radius and across a range of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, spanning from $10^6$ to $10^9 \rm M_\odot$, for two popular AGN disk models. We find that, in the outer regions of the disk, stars evolve similarly to those in the interstellar medium, but in the inner and denser regions accretion quickly turns low-mass stars into massive stars, and their fate depends on just how quickly they accrete. If accretion occurs at a faster rate than nuclear burning, they can reach a quasi-steady `immortal' state. If stars accrete faster than they can thermally adjust, runaway accretion occurs, potentially preventing a quasi-steady state and altering the disk structure. During the AGN lifetime, in the regions of the disk that produce massive stars, supernovae (SNe) and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) may occur within the disk over a wide range of optical depths and ambient densities. Subsequently, in the final phase of the AGN, as the disk becomes depleted, formerly immortal stars will be unable to replenish their fuel, leading to additional SNe and GRBs.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ with SPICE: Interpreting Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z&gt;5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emission is key to understanding the process of cosmic reionisation. JWST is finally enabling us to measure Ly$\alpha$ emission deep into the epoch of reionisation for an increasing number of galaxies. However, discrepancies between measurements of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW$_0$) of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have been noted between JWST and ground-based facilities. We employ SPICE, a suite of radiation-hydrodynamical simulations featuring different stellar feedback models, and investigate the impact of radiative transfer effects and observational systematics on the measured Ly$\alpha$ EW$_0$. We perform radiative transfer of Ly$\alpha$ and UV photons for SPICE galaxies to mimic slit spectroscopy for ground-based slits and JWST-MSA pseudo-slits. Spatial Ly$\alpha$-UV offsets exist independently of feedback model, and are common ($&gt;70$% galaxies) with median values of $\approx0.07-0.11''$ and these predictions are consistent with the observed spatial offsets. Spatial Ly$\alpha$-UV offsets are a major cause of loss of flux for JWST-MSA observations, with median pseudo-slit losses of $\approx65$%, and $\approx30$% cases suffering from $&gt;95$% pseudo-slit losses. Even in the absence of such spatial offsets, the presence of extended emission can cause median pseudo-slit losses of $40$%, with $4$% cases suffering from $&gt;95$% pseudo-slit losses. Complex galaxy morphologies or misplaced JWST-MSA pseudo-slit can lead to under-estimated UV continuum, resulting in spuriously high estimates of EW$_0$ from JWST in $6-8$% of galaxies. We compare the predictions from {\tt SPICE} to 25 galaxies with Ly$\alpha$ emission observations from both the ground and JWST. The EW$_0^{\tt JWST}$ and the EW$_0^{\tt Ground}$ exhibit scatter in line with predictions, indicating that both physical and systematic effects are likely at play.</description>

      <title>A galactic outflow traced by its extended Mg II emission out to a $\sim30$ kpc radius in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a rare Mg II $\lambda$$\lambda$ 2796, 2803 doublet emission halo around a star forming galaxy with $\log (M_\star$/M$_\odot) = 10.3 \pm 0.3$ at $z=0.737$ in deep (9.94 h) VLT/MUSE data from the MUSE-HUDF mosaic. While the central region prominently displays an absorption-dominated Mg II doublet, characterized by discernible P-Cyg features, our examination reveals a remarkably extended Mg II emission, spanning approximately $\sim30$ kpc from the central galaxy. We introduce a simple outflow radiative transfer modeling scheme based on the Sobolev approximation, and we employ a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) fitting to find the best-fitting parameters that match our data. The model reproduces several key features of the observed Mg II halo and allows us to constrain the kinematics and geometry of the outflowing gas. Our data are consistent with a biconical wind whose velocity increases with radius, pointing nearly towards the observer, with an opening angle of $59\pm4^{\circ}$ In general, we find that our outflow model performs better in the inner regions of the galactic wind ($\lesssim 10$ kpc $\approx 6$ half-light radii), reaching a velocity of $\sim120$ km s$^{-1}$ at 10 kpc from the central galaxy. However, discrepancies between the data and the model in the outer regions suggest the possible influence of additional mechanisms, such as inflows, satellite interactions, or turbulence, which might significantly shape the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at larger impact parameters. This analysis underscores the complexity of galactic outflows and encourages further exploration of the processes governing the dynamics of galactic winds through spatially resolved studies of the CGM.</description>

      <title>HR-GO I: Comprehensive NLTE abundance analysis of the Cetus stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxy streams encode vast amounts of information essential to understanding early galaxy formation and nucleosynthesis channels. Due to the variation in the timescales of star formation history in their progenitors, stellar streams serve as `snapshots' that record different stages of galactic chemical evolution. This study focusses on the Cetus stream, stripped from a low-mass dwarf galaxy. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition of 22 member stars based on their high-resolution spectra. We derived abundances for up to 28 chemical species from C to Dy and, for 20 of them, we account for the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. We confirm that the Cetus stream has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-2.11$ $\pm$ 0.21. All observed Cetus stars are $\alpha$ enhanced with [$\alpha$/Fe] $\simeq$ 0.3. The absence of the $\alpha$-`knee' implies that star formation stopped before iron production in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) became substantial. Neutron capture element abundances suggest that both the rapid (r-) and the main slow (s-) processes contributed to their origin. The decrease in [Eu/Ba] from a typical r-process value of [Eu/Ba] = 0.7 to 0.3 with increasing [Ba/H] indicates a distinct contribution of the r- and s-processes to the chemical composition of different Cetus stars. For barium, the r-process contribution varies from 100 % to 20 % in different sample stars, with an average value of 50 %. Our abundance analysis indicates that the star formation in the Cetus progenitor ceased after the onset of the main s-process in low- to intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars but before SNe Ia played an important role. A distinct evolution scenario is revealed by comparing the abundances in the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, showing the diversity in the chemical evolution of low-mass dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galaxies Lighting Up: Discovery of Seventy New Turn-on Changing-look Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Changing-look quasars" (CLQs), discovered less than a decade ago, show dramatic, rapid changes in optical/UV continuum and broad line emission. The majority of CLQs have been found dimming as "turn-off" CLQs because most selection methods start from samples of spectroscopically-confirmed quasars. We present here a sample of 82 spectroscopically confirmed "turn-on" CLQs, 70 of which are newly identified. The turn-on CLQs are selected from spectroscopically classified galaxies with subsequent significant and dramatic variability in both the optical and mid-infrared bands, indicating a mechanism of changing accretion rate of the supermassive black holes rather than variable obscuration. Based on their bright state Eddington ratios, turn-on CLQs are associated with lower accretion rates compared to turn-off CLQs or typical SDSS quasars with similar redshift and magnitude distributions, even though turn-on CLQs have lower black hole masses. Most turn-on CLQs reside in host galaxies that follow local relations between the central black hole mass and host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and velocity dispersion. However, their host galaxies have higher mass than normal inactive galaxies, with star formation rates more similar to hosts of Type 2 AGN than to the overall galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of Interstellar 3-Pyrroline: Formation, Rotational and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of CN-functionalized aromatics partly addresses the long-standing mystery of the apparent absence of five- and six-membered rings in interstellar environments. N-heterocycles, which are crucial as the fundamental structures of nucleobases, have been a focus of these aromatic searches due to their biological significance. Although N-heterocycles have not been conclusively detected in astrophysical environments, their presence in chondrites and meteorites signifies their interstellar and circumstellar connection. Precise spectral data identifies the unique signatures of molecules, confirming their presence in space. In this light, the present work reports an extensive computational investigation on interstellar 3-pyrroline; a five-membered ring N-heterocycle. This includes an alternative formation route in cold interstellar environments and highly accurate rotational and vibrational spectroscopy. The results indicate that 3-pyrroline can form on dust grain surfaces from vinyl cyanide, as its formation from pyrrole through double hydrogenation may lead to the formation of pyrrole itself via a H$_{2}$ abstraction process. 3-pyrroline's rotational transition at 52.3 GHz offers a potential tool for its detection in cold interstellar regions. Additionally, the strongest infrared features of 3-pyrroline at 16.09 $\mu$m and $\sim$3.50 $\mu$m are observable with JWST. The provided data is crucial for laboratory identification and future interstellar observations of 3-pyrroline at both radio and IR wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The evolution of molecular clouds: global radial collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star formation efficiency (SFE) measures the proportion of molecular gas converted into stars, while the star formation rate (SFR) indicates the rate at which gas is transformed into stars. Here we propose such a model in the framework of a global radial collapse of molecular clouds, where the collapse velocity depends on the density profile and the initial mass-to-radius ratio of molecular clouds, with the collapse velocity accelerating during the collapse process. This simplified analytical model allows us to estimate a lifetime of giant molecular clouds of approximately $0.44-7.36 \times 10^7\, \rm{yr}$, and a star formation timescale of approximately $0.5-5.88 \times 10^6\, \rm{yr}$. Additionally, we can predict an SFE of approximately $1.59\, \%$, and an SFR of roughly $1.85\, \rm{M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$ for the Milky Way in agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE) IV. Environmental dependence of the fiber widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their variety of scales throughout the interstellar medium, filaments in nearby low-mass clouds show a characteristic width of $\sim$ 0.1 pc from the analysis of {\it Herschel} observations. The origin of this characteristic width, however, has been a matter of intense discussions during the last decade. We explored a possible variation in this typical width with the EMERGE Early ALMA Survey, which includes seven star-forming regions in Orion (OMC-1/-2/-3/-4 South, LDN 1641N, NGC 2023, Flame Nebula). These targets, which exhibit different physical conditions, star formation histories, mass, and density regimes, were homogeneously surveyed at a resolution of $\sim$ 2000 au in N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0) with ALMA+IRAM-30m observations. We characterised the column density and temperature radial profiles of the 152 fibers identified in the survey using the automatic fitting routine FilChap. These Orion fibers show a departure from the isothermal condition with significant outward temperature gradients with $\nabla T_\mathrm{K} &gt; 30$ K pc$^{-1}$. They also show a median full width at half maximum ($FWHM$) of $\sim 0.05$ pc, with a corresponding median aspect ratio of $\sim2$. More relevantly, we observe a systematic variation in these fiber $FWHM$ between different regions in our sample, and a direct inverse dependence of these $FWHM$ on their central column density, $N_0$, above $\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. This dependency agrees with the expected $N_0-FWHM$ anti-correlation predicted in previous theoretical studies. Our homogeneous analysis returns the first observational evidence of an intrinsic and systematic variation in the fiber widths across different star-forming regions. While sharing comparable mass, length, and kinematic properties in all of our targets, fibers appear to adjust their $FWHM$ to their density and to the pressure in their host environment.</description>

      <title>Deep extragalactic HI survey of the COSMOS field with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep HI survey at L-band conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) over the COSMOS field. This survey is strategically designed to overlap with the MIGHTEE COSMOS field, aiming to combine the sensitivity of the FAST and high-resolution of the MeerKAT. We observed the field with FAST for 11 hours covering $\sim$2 square degrees, and reduced the raw data to HI spectral cubes over the frequency range 1310-1420 MHz. The FAST-HI data reach a median 3$\sigma$ column density of $N_{\rm HI}\sim2\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ over a 5 km s$^{-1}$ channel width, allowing for studies of the distribution of HI gas in various environments, such as in galaxies, the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) and Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We visually searched the spectral cubes for HI sources, and found a total of 80 HI detections, of which 56 have been cross-matched with the MIGHTEE-HI catalogue. With the cross-matched sources, we compare their HI masses and find that the total HI mass fraction in the IGM and CGM surrounding the galaxy pairs is statistically higher than the HI fraction surrounding the isolated galaxies by a difference of 13$\pm$4%, indicating that the CGM and IGM associated with interacting systems are richer in neutral hydrogen compared to those around isolated galaxies in the local Universe. We also describe several FAST-MeerKAT synergy projects, highlighting the full potential of exploiting both single-dish and interferometric observations to study the distribution and evolution of the diffuse HI gas.</description>

      <title>Witnessing the onset of Reionisation via Lyman-$\alpha$ emission at redshift 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Cosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift $z = 14$, when the Universe was less than 300 Myr old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift $z = 13.0$ that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly$\alpha$, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of $\text{EW}_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} &gt; 40 \, \AA$ (rest frame), previously only seen at $z &lt; 9$ where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with a very blue UV continuum, the Ly$\alpha$ line indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer of ionising photons, a significant fraction of which may escape. This suggests it resides in an early reionised region preventing complete extinction of Ly$\alpha$, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only 330 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. IV. Data release of 263 spectra from 245 unique sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We release fully reduced spectra obtained with NIRSpec onboard JWST as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program and a follow-up Director's Discretionary Time program 2756. From these 263 spectra of 245 unique sources, acquired with low ($R =30-300$) and high dispersion ($R\sim2700$) gratings, we derive redshifts for 200 unique sources in the redshift range $z=0-10$. We describe the sample selection and characterize its high completeness as a function of redshift and apparent magnitude. Comparison with independent estimates based on different methods and instruments shows that the redshifts are accurate, with 80\% differing less than 0.005. We stack the GLASS-JWST spectra to produce the first high-resolution ($R \sim 2700$) JWST spectral template extending in the rest frame wavelength from 2000~\AA\ to 20, 000~\AA. Catalogs, reduced spectra, and template are made publicly available to the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze a volume-limited sample from the SDSS and explore how cosmic web environments affect the interrelations between various galaxy properties, such as $(u-r)$ colour, stellar mass, specific star formation rate, metallicity, concentration index, and $D4000$. Our analysis reveals that the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) account for approximately $\sim 72\%$ of the data variance. We then classify galaxies into different cosmic web environments based on the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor and compare PC1 and PC2 across these environments, ensuring a mass-matched sample of equal size for each environment. We observe that PC1 displays clear bimodality across all cosmic web environments, with sheets and clusters showing distinct preferences for negative and positive PC1 values, respectively. PC2, on the other hand, shows a positively skewed unimodal distribution in all environments. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test confirms that the distributions of PC1 and PC2 differ significantly across environments, with a confidence level exceeding $99.99\%$. Furthermore, we calculate the normalized mutual information (NMI) between the principal components and individual galaxy properties within different cosmic web environments. A two-tailed t-test reveals that for each relationship and each pair of environments, the null hypothesis is rejected with a confidence level $&gt;99.99\%$. Our analysis confirms that cosmic web environments play a significant role in shaping the correlations between galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>A VLA Study of Newly-Discovered Southern Latitude Non-Thermal Filaments in the Galactic Center: Polarimetric and Magnetic Field Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A population of structures unique to the Galactic Center (GC), known as the non-thermal filaments (NTFs), has been studied for over 40 years, but much remains unknown about them. In particular, there is no widely-accepted and unified understanding for how the relativistic electrons illuminating these structures are generated. One possibility is that there are compact and extended sources of Cosmic Rays (CRs), which then diffuse along magnetic flux tubes leading to the illumination of the NTFs through synchrotron emission. In this work, we present and discuss the polarimetric distributions associated with a set of faint NTFs in the GC that have only been studied in total intensity previously. We compare the derived polarized intensity, rotation measure, and intrinsic magnetic field distributions for these structures with the results obtained for previously observed GC NTFs. The results are then used to enhance our understanding of the large-scale polarimetric properties of the GC. We then use the derived polarimetric distributions to constrain models for the mechanisms generating the relativistic electrons that illuminate these structures.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the properties of $\nu$MSM dark matter using the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass galaxies provide a powerful tool with which to investigate departures from the standard cosmological paradigm in models that suppress the abundance of small dark matter structures. One of the simplest metrics that can be used to compare different models is the abundance of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way. Viable dark matter models must produce enough substructure to host the observed number of Galactic satellites. Here, we scrutinize the predictions of the neutrino Minimal Standard Model ($\nu{\rm MSM}$), a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which the production of sterile neutrino dark matter is resonantly enhanced by a lepton asymmetry in the primordial plasma. This process enables the model to evade current constraints associated with non-resonantly produced dark matter. Independently of assumptions about galaxy formation physics we rule out, with at least 95 per cent confidence, all parameterizations of the $\nu{\rm MSM}$ with sterile neutrino rest mass, $M_{\rm s} \leq 1.4\, {\rm keV}$. Incorporating physically motivated prescriptions of baryonic processes and modelling the effects of reionization strengthen our constraints, and we exclude all $\nu{\rm MSM}$ parameterizations with $M_{\rm s} \leq 4\, {\rm keV}$. Unlike other literature, our fiducial constraints do not rule out the putative 3.55 keV X-ray line, if it is indeed produced by the decay of a sterile neutrino; however, some of the most favoured parameter space is excluded. If the Milky Way satellite count is higher than we assume, or if the Milky Way halo is less massive than $M^{\rm MW}_{200} = 8 \times 10^{11}\, {\rm M_\odot}$, we rule out the $\nu{\rm MSM}$ as the origin of the 3.55 keV excess. In contrast with other work, we find that the constraints from satellite counts are substantially weaker than those reported from X-ray non-detections.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variables and AM CVn Binaries in SRG/eROSITA + Gaia: Volume Limited Samples, X-ray Luminosity Functions, and Space Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present volume-limited samples of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and AM CVn binaries jointly selected from SRG/eROSITA eRASS1 and \textit{Gaia} DR3 using an X-ray + optical color-color diagram (the ``X-ray Main Sequence"). This tool identifies all CV subtypes, including magnetic and low-accretion rate systems, in contrast to most previous surveys. We find 23 CVs, 3 of which are AM CVns, out to 150 pc in the Western Galactic Hemisphere. Our 150 pc sample is spectroscopically verified and complete down to $L_X = 1.3\times 10^{29} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.2--2.3 keV band, and we also present CV candidates out to 300 pc and 1000 pc. We discovered two previously unknown systems in our 150 pc sample: the third nearest AM CVn and a magnetic period bouncer. We find the mean $L_X$ of CVs to be $\langle L_X \rangle \approx 4.6\times 10^{30} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, in contrast to previous surveys which yielded $\langle L_X \rangle \sim 10^{31}-10^{32} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We construct X-ray luminosity functions that, for the first time, flatten out at $L_X\sim 10^{30} \; \textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We find average number, mass, and luminosity densities of $\rho_\textrm{N, CV} = (3.7 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{-6} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$, $\rho_M = (5.0 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$, and $\rho_{L_X} = (2.3 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{26} \textrm{erg s}^{-1}M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, in the solar neighborhood. Our uniform selection method also allows us to place meaningful estimates on the space density of AM CVns, $\rho_\textrm{N, AM CVn} = (5.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-7} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$. Magnetic CVs and period bouncers make up $35\%$ and $25\%$ of our sample, respectively. This work, through a novel discovery technique, shows that the observed number densities of CVs and AM CVns, as well as the fraction of period bouncers, are still in tension with population synthesis estimates.</description>

      <title>The Remarkable X-ray Spectra and Variability of the Ultraluminous Weak-Line Quasar SDSS J1521+5202</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a focused X-ray and multiwavelength study of the ultraluminous weak-line quasar (WLQ) SDSS J1521+5202, one of the few X-ray weak WLQs that is amenable to basic X-ray spectral and variability investigations. J1521+5202 shows striking X-ray variability during 2006--2023, by up to a factor of $\approx 32$ in 0.5--2 keV flux, and our new 2023 Chandra observation caught it in its brightest X-ray flux state to date. Concurrent infrared/optical observations show only mild variability. The 2023 Chandra spectrum can be acceptably described by a power law with intrinsic X-ray absorption, and it reveals a nominal intrinsic level of X-ray emission relative to its optical/ultraviolet emission. In contrast, an earlier Chandra spectrum from 2013 shows apparent spectral complexity that is not well fit by a variety of models, including ionized-absorption or standard Compton-reflection models. Overall, the observations are consistent with the thick-disk plus outflow model previously advanced for WLQs, where a nominal level of underlying X-ray emission plus variable absorption lead to the remarkable observed X-ray variability. In the case of J1521+5202 it appears likely that the outflow, and not the thick disk itself, lies along our line-of-sight and causes the X-ray absorption.</description>

      <title>The AMBRE Project: Lead abundance in Galactic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of neutron capture elements in the Milky Way is still a matter of debate. Although more and more studies investigate their chemical behaviour, there is still a lack of a significant large sample of abundances of a key heavy element: lead. Lead is the final product of the s-process nucleosynthesis channel and is one of the most stable heavy elements. We analysed high-resolution spectra from the ESO UVES and FEROS archives. Atmospheric parameters were taken from the AMBRE parametrisation. We used the automated abundance method GAUGUIN to derive lead abundances in 653 slow-rotating FGK-type stars from the 368.34nm Pb I line. We present the largest catalogue of homogeneous LTE and non-LTE lead abundances ever published with metallicities ranging from -2.9 to 0.6dex and [Pb/Fe] from -0.7 to 3.3dex. Within this sample, no lead-enhanced Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars were found, but nine lead-enhanced metal-poor stars ([Pb/Fe] &gt; 1.5) were detected. Most of them were already identified as carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with enrichments in other s-process species. The lead abundance of 13 Gaia Benchmark Stars are also provided. We then investigated the Pb content of the Milky Way disc by computing vertical and radial gradients and found a slightly decreasing [Pb/Fe] radial trend with metallicity. This trend together with other related ratios ([Pb/Eu], [Pb/Ba], and [Pb/alpha]) are interpreted thanks to chemical evolution models. The two-infall model closely reproduces the observed trends with respect to the metallicity. It is also found that the AGB contribution to the Pb Galactic enrichment has to be strongly reduced. Moreover, the contribution of massive stars with rather high rotational velocities should be favoured in the low-metallicity regime.</description>

      <title>Discs are born eccentric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have begun probing the early phases of disc formation, but little data yet exists on disc structure and morphology of Class 0 objects. Using simulations, we are able to lay out predictions of disc morphologies expected in future surveys of young discs. Based on detailed simulations of ab initio star formation by core collapse, we predict that early discs must be eccentric. In this letter, we study the morphology and, in particular, the eccentricity of discs formed in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse simulations. We attempt to show that discs formed by cloud collapse are likely to be eccentric. We ran non-ideal MHD collapse simulations in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES with radiative transfer. We used state-of-the-art analysis methods to measure the disc eccentricity. We find that despite no asymmetry in the initial conditions, the discs formed are eccentric, with eccentricities on the order of 0.1. These results may have important implications for protoplanetary disc dynamics and planet formation. The presence of eccentricity in young discs that is not seen at later stages of disc evolution is in tension with current viscous eccentricity damping models. This implies that there may be an as-yet undiscovered circularisation mechanism in circumstellar discs.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Mass Loss in Binary Stars. V. Effects of Metallicity and Nonconservative Mass Transfer -- Application in High Mass X-ray Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are responsible for many unusual astrophysical phenomena, including some important explosive cosmic events. The stability criteria for rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental to binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of systems such as X-ray binaries and merging gravitational-wave sources. We use our adiabatic mass-loss model to systematically survey metal-poor and solar-metallicity donor thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer. The critical mass ratios qad are systematically explored, and the impact of metallicity and nonconservative mass transfer are studied. For metal-poor radiative-envelope donors, qad are smaller than those for solar-metallicity stars at the same evolutionary stage. However, qad do the opposite for convective-envelope donors. Nonconservative mass transfer significantly decreases qad for massive donors. This is because it matters how conservative mass transfer is during the thermal timescale phase immediately preceding a delayed dynamical mass transfer. We apply our theoretical predictions to observed high-mass X-ray binaries that have overfilled their Roche lobes and find a good agreement with their mass ratios. Our results can be applied to study individual binary objects or large samples of binary objects with binary population synthesis codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the unwanted formation of molecular hydrogen is successfully suppressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some of the dark matter or all of a subdominant decaying species successfully allows direct collapse of the cloud to a SMBH.</description>

      <title>JWST view of four infant galaxies at z=8.31-8.49 in the MACS0416 field and implications for reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy provides redshifts for four z&gt;8 galaxies located behind the lensing cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Two of them, "Y1" and "JD", have previously reported spectroscopic redshifts based on ALMA measurements of [OIII] 88 $\mu$m and/or [CII] 157.7 $\mu$m lines. Y1 is a merging system of three components, and the existing redshift z=8.31 is confirmed. However, JD is at z=8.34 instead of the previously claimed z=9.28. JD's close companion, "JD-N", which was a previously discovered z&gt;8 candidate, is now identified at the same redshift as JD. JD and JD-N form an interacting pair. A new candidate at z&gt;8, "f090d_018", is also confirmed and is at z=8.49. These four objects are likely part of an overdensity that signposts a large structure extending ~165 kpc in projected distance and ~48.7 Mpc in radial distance. They are magnified by less than one magnitude and have intrinsic $M_{UV}$ ranging from -19.57 to -20.83 mag. Their spectral energy distributions show that the galaxies are all very young with ages ~ 4-18 Myr and stellar masses about $10^{7-8}$ ${\rm M_\odot}$. These infant galaxies have very different star formation rates ranging from a few to over a hundred $\rm{M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, but only two of them (JD and f090d_018) have blue rest-frame UV slopes $\beta&lt;-2.0$ indicative of a high Lyman-continuum photon escape fraction that could contribute significantly to the cosmic hydrogen-reionizing background. Interestingly, these two galaxies are the least massive and least active ones among the four. The other two systems have much flatter UV slopes largely because of their high dust extinction ($A_{\rm V}$=0.9-1.0 mag). Their much lower indicated escape fractions show that even very young, actively star-forming galaxies can have negligible contribution to reionization when they quickly form dust throughout their bodies.</description>

      <title>Sequential formation of supermassive stars and heavy seed BHs through the interplay of cosmological cold accretion and stellar radiative feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMSs) and heavy seed black holes, as their remnants, are promising candidates for Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) progenitors, especially for ones observed in the early universe $ z\simeq 8.5-10$ by recent JWST observations. Expected cradles of SMSs are the atomic cooling halos ($M_{\rm halo}\simeq 10^7~{\rm M_\odot}$), where "cold accretion" emerges and possibly forms SMSs. We perform a suit of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations and investigate star formation after the emergence of cold accretion, solving radiative feedback from stars inside the halo. We follow the mass growth of the protostars for $\sim 3~{\rm Myr}$, resolving the gas inflow down to $\sim 0.1~{\rm pc}$ scales. We discover that, after cold accretion emerges, multiple SMSs of $m_\star \gtrsim 10^5{\rm M_\odot}$ form at the halo centre with the accretion rates maintained at $\dot{m}_\star \simeq 0.04~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ for $\lesssim 3~{\rm Myr}$. Cold accretion supplies gas at a rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm gas}\gtrsim 0.01-0.1~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ from outside the halo virial radius to the central gas disc. Gravitational torques from spiral arms transport gas further inward, which feeds the SMSs. Radiative feedback from stars suppresses H$_2$ cooling and disc fragmentation, while photoevaporation is prevented by a dense envelope, which attenuates ionising radiation. Our results suggest that cold accretion can bring efficient BH mass growth after seed formation in the later universe. Moreover, cold accretion and gas migration inside the central disc increase the mass concentration and provide a promising formation site for the extremely compact stellar clusters observed by JWST.</description>

For events with timescales $\leq$ 60 days, a Jerk Parallax degeneracy arises due to high Jerk velocity ($\tilde{v_{j}}$), causing a four-fold continuous parallax degeneracy. OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, after incorporating orbital parallax, reveals four discrete degenerate parallax solutions, while OGLE-2017-BLG-0192 exhibits four discrete solutions without degeneracy. {The asymmetric light curve of OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 suggests a more probable model where xallarap is added to the parallax model, introducing tension. The galactic model analysis predicts a very low mass stellar lens for OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, degenerate solutions suggest a low-mass star or a darker lens in the disc, while the Xallarap+Parallax model also predicts a stellar lens in the bulge, with the source being a solar-type star orbited by a dwarf star.} This study presents five degenerate solutions for OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, emphasizing the potential for confirmation through high-resolution Adaptive Optics (AO) observations with Extremely Large Telescopes in the future. The complexities of degenerate scenarios in these microlensing events underscore the need to analyze special single-lens events in the Roman Telescope Era.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Frequency View of the Radio Phoenix in the Abell 85 Cluster</title>

Abstract: Radio phoenices are complex and filamentary diffuse radio sources found in both merging and relaxed clusters. The formation of these sources was proposed to be due to adiabatic compression of old Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) plasma in shock waves. Most of the previous spectral studies of these sources were limited to integrated spectral indices, which were found to be very steep as well as showing a curved spectrum. Here, we have performed a multi-frequency investigation of the radio phoenix in the Abell 85 cluster. Owing to the sensitive high-resolution observations, we found some of the finer filamentary structures that were previously undetected. We produced resolved spectral index maps of the radio phoenix between 323, 700, and 1280 MHz. The orientation of the filaments, as well as the gradient across the spectral index maps, suggest the possible direction of the shock motion from northeast to southwest. The integrated spectrum of the radio phoenix was found to be very steep and curved toward high-frequencies. Furthermore, the spectral index of the filaments was found to be less steep compared to the non-filamentary regions, implying greater energy injection in the filaments. The observed features in the radio phoenix in the Abell 85 cluster seem to be in support of the adiabatic shock compression mechanism.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Optical identification and properties of galaxy clusters and groups in the western galactic hemisphere</title>

Abstract: The first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) provides the largest intracluster medium-selected galaxy cluster and group catalog covering the western galactic hemisphere. Compared to samples selected purely on X-ray extent, the sample purity can be enhanced by identifying cluster candidates using optical and near-infrared data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Using the red-sequence-based cluster finder eROMaPPer, we measured individual photometric properties (redshift $z_\lambda$, richness $\lambda$, optical center, and BCG position) for 12,000 eRASS1 clusters over a sky area of 13,116 deg$^2$, augmented by 247 cases identified by matching the candidates with known clusters from the literature. The median redshift of the identified eRASS1 sample is $z=0.31$, with 10% of the clusters at $z&gt;0.72$. The photometric redshifts have an accuracy of $\delta z/(1+z)&lt;0.005$ for $0.05&lt;z&lt;0.9$. Spectroscopic cluster properties (redshift $z_{\rm spec}$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma$) are measured a posteriori for a subsample of 3,210 and 1,499 eRASS1 clusters, respectively, using an extensive compilation of spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies from the literature. We infer that the primary eRASS1 sample has a purity of 86% and optical completeness &gt;95% for $z&gt;0.05$. For these and further quality assessments of the eRASS1 identified catalog, we applied our identification method to a collection of galaxy cluster catalogs in the literature, as well as blindly on the full Legacy Surveys covering 24,069 deg$^2$. Using a combination of these cluster samples, we investigated the velocity dispersion-richness relation, finding $\log(\lambda)=2.401\times\log(\sigma)-5.074$ with an intrinsic scatter of $0.10\pm0.01$ dex. Our main result is the identified eRASS1 cluster catalog with a high purity and a well-defined X-ray selection process, enabling precise cosmological analyses presented in companion papers.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>Repeating nuclear transients from repeating partial tidal disruption events: reproducing ASASSN-14ko and AT2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass ($\gtrsim 1 M_{\odot}$), evolved stars can survive many ($\gtrsim 10-100$) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing $few \times 0.01 M_{\odot}$, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko's flares, $\dot{P}\simeq-0.0026$. Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.</description>
