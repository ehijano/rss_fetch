      <title>On the Utility of Speech and Audio Foundation Models for Marmoset Call Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marmoset monkeys encode vital information in their calls and serve as a surrogate model for neuro-biologists to understand the evolutionary origins of human vocal communication. Traditionally analyzed with signal processing-based features, recent approaches have utilized self-supervised models pre-trained on human speech for feature extraction, capitalizing on their ability to learn a signal's intrinsic structure independently of its acoustic domain. However, the utility of such foundation models remains unclear for marmoset call analysis in terms of multi-class classification, bandwidth, and pre-training domain. This study assesses feature representations derived from speech and general audio domains, across pre-training bandwidths of 4, 8, and 16 kHz for marmoset call-type and caller classification tasks. Results show that models with higher bandwidth improve performance, and pre-training on speech or general audio yields comparable results, improving over a spectral baseline.</description>

      <title>Audio Prompt Adapter: Unleashing Music Editing Abilities for Text-to-Music with Lightweight Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-music models allow users to generate nearly realistic musical audio with textual commands. However, editing music audios remains challenging due to the conflicting desiderata of performing fine-grained alterations on the audio while maintaining a simple user interface. To address this challenge, we propose Audio Prompt Adapter (or AP-Adapter), a lightweight addition to pretrained text-to-music models. We utilize AudioMAE to extract features from the input audio, and construct attention-based adapters to feedthese features into the internal layers of AudioLDM2, a diffusion-based text-to-music model. With 22M trainable parameters, AP-Adapter empowers users to harness both global (e.g., genre and timbre) and local (e.g., melody) aspects of music, using the original audio and a short text as inputs. Through objective and subjective studies, we evaluate AP-Adapter on three tasks: timbre transfer, genre transfer, and accompaniment generation. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness on out-of-domain audios containing unseen instruments during training.</description>

      <title>Distortion Recovery: A Two-Stage Method for Guitar Effect Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing audio effects from electric guitar recordings makes it easier for post-production and sound editing. An audio distortion recovery model not only improves the clarity of the guitar sounds but also opens up new opportunities for creative adjustments in mixing and mastering. While progress have been made in creating such models, previous efforts have largely focused on synthetic distortions that may be too simplistic to accurately capture the complexities seen in real-world recordings.
  In this paper, we tackle the task by using a dataset of guitar recordings rendered with commercial-grade audio effect VST plugins. Moreover, we introduce a novel two-stage methodology for audio distortion recovery. The idea is to firstly process the audio signal in the Mel-spectrogram domain in the first stage, and then use a neural vocoder to generate the pristine original guitar sound from the processed Mel-spectrogram in the second stage. We report a set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods, through both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Input Aids a Bayesian Model of Phonetic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the many tasks facing the typically-developing child language learner is learning to discriminate between the distinctive sounds that make up words in their native language. Here we investigate whether multimodal information--specifically adult speech coupled with video frames of speakers' faces--benefits a computational model of phonetic learning. We introduce a method for creating high-quality synthetic videos of speakers' faces for an existing audio corpus. Our learning model, when both trained and tested on audiovisual inputs, achieves up to a 8.1% relative improvement on a phoneme discrimination battery compared to a model trained and tested on audio-only input. It also outperforms the audio model by up to 3.9% when both are tested on audio-only data, suggesting that visual information facilitates the acquisition of acoustic distinctions. Visual information is especially beneficial in noisy audio environments, where an audiovisual model closes 67% of the loss in discrimination performance of the audio model in noise relative to a non-noisy environment. These results demonstrate that visual information benefits an ideal learner and illustrate some of the ways that children might be able to leverage visual cues when learning to discriminate speech sounds.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Prompt Design for LLM-Based Post-ASR Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the strength of modern large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that can elevate the performance of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>The CHiME-8 DASR Challenge for Generalizable and Array Agnostic Distant Automatic Speech Recognition and Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the CHiME-8 DASR challenge which carries on from the previous edition CHiME-7 DASR (C7DASR) and the past CHiME-6 challenge. It focuses on joint multi-channel distant speech recognition (DASR) and diarization with one or more, possibly heterogeneous, devices. The main goal is to spur research towards meeting transcription approaches that can generalize across arbitrary number of speakers, diverse settings (formal vs. informal conversations), meeting duration, wide-variety of acoustic scenarios and different recording configurations. Novelties with respect to C7DASR include: i) the addition of NOTSOFAR-1, an additional office/corporate meeting scenario, ii) a manually corrected Mixer 6 development set, iii) a new track in which we allow the use of large-language models (LLM) iv) a jury award mechanism to encourage participants to explore also more practical and innovative solutions. To lower the entry barrier for participants, we provide a standalone toolkit for downloading and preparing such datasets as well as performing text normalization and scoring their submissions. Furthermore, this year we also provide two baseline systems, one directly inherited from C7DASR and based on ESPnet and another one developed on NeMo and based on NeMo team submission in last year C7DASR. Baseline system results suggest that the addition of the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario significantly increases the task's difficulty due to its high number of speakers and very short duration.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework for Audio Temporal Forgery Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel form of audio partial forgery has posed challenges to its forensics, requiring advanced countermeasures to detect subtle forgery manipulations within long-duration audio. However, existing countermeasures still serve a classification purpose and fail to perform meaningful analysis of the start and end timestamps of partial forgery segments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine proposal refinement framework (CFPRF) that incorporates a frame-level detection network (FDN) and a proposal refinement network (PRN) for audio temporal forgery detection and localization. Specifically, the FDN aims to mine informative inconsistency cues between real and fake frames to obtain discriminative features that are beneficial for roughly indicating forgery regions. The PRN is responsible for predicting confidence scores and regression offsets to refine the coarse-grained proposals derived from the FDN. To learn robust discriminative features, we devise a difference-aware feature learning (DAFL) module guided by contrastive representation learning to enlarge the sensitive differences between different frames induced by minor manipulations. We further design a boundary-aware feature enhancement (BAFE) module to capture the contextual information of multiple transition boundaries and guide the interaction between boundary information and temporal features via a cross-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that our CFPRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, including LAV-DF, ASVS2019PS, and HAD.</description>

      <title>Synthesizer Sound Matching Using Audio Spectrogram Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems for synthesizer sound matching, which automatically set the parameters of a synthesizer to emulate an input sound, have the potential to make the process of synthesizer programming faster and easier for novice and experienced musicians alike, whilst also affording new means of interaction with synthesizers. Considering the enormous variety of synthesizers in the marketplace, and the complexity of many of them, general-purpose sound matching systems that function with minimal knowledge or prior assumptions about the underlying synthesis architecture are particularly desirable. With this in mind, we introduce a synthesizer sound matching model based on the Audio Spectrogram Transformer. We demonstrate the viability of this model by training on a large synthetic dataset of randomly generated samples from the popular Massive synthesizer. We show that this model can reconstruct parameters of samples generated from a set of 16 parameters, highlighting its improved fidelity relative to multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network baselines. We also provide audio examples demonstrating the out-of-domain model performance in emulating vocal imitations, and sounds from other synthesizers and musical instruments.</description>

      <title>Automatic Equalization for Individual Instrument Tracks Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for the automatic equalization of individual musical instrument tracks. Our method begins by identifying the instrument present within a source recording in order to choose its corresponding ideal spectrum as a target. Next, the spectral difference between the recording and the target is calculated, and accordingly, an equalizer matching model is used to predict settings for a parametric equalizer. To this end, we build upon a differentiable parametric equalizer matching neural network, demonstrating improvements relative to previously established state-of-the-art. Unlike past approaches, we show how our system naturally allows real-world audio data to be leveraged during the training of our matching model, effectively generating suitably produced training targets in an automated manner mirroring conditions at inference time. Consequently, we illustrate how fine-tuning our matching model on such examples considerably improves parametric equalizer matching performance in real-world scenarios, decreasing mean absolute error by 24% relative to methods relying solely on random parameter sampling techniques as a self-supervised learning strategy. We perform listening tests, and demonstrate that our proposed automatic equalization solution subjectively enhances the tonal characteristics for recordings of common instrument types.</description>

      <title>Integrating IP Broadcasting with Audio Tags: Workflow and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The broadcasting industry is increasingly adopting IP techniques, revolutionising both live and pre-recorded content production, from news gathering to live music events. IP broadcasting allows for the transport of audio and video signals in an easily configurable way, aligning with modern networking techniques. This shift towards an IP workflow allows for much greater flexibility, not only in routing signals but with the integration of tools using standard web development techniques. One possible tool could include the use of live audio tagging, which has a number of uses in the production of content. These include from automated closed captioning to identifying unwanted sound events within a scene. In this paper, we describe the process of containerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated code module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network setups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable of seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small productions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the selected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end product are discussed.</description>

      <title>EMO-Codec: A Depth Look at Emotion Preservation Capacity of Legacy and Neural Codec Models With Subjective and Objective Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neural codec model reduces speech data transmission delay and serves as the foundational tokenizer for speech language models (speech LMs). Preserving emotional information in codecs is crucial for effective communication and context understanding. However, there is a lack of studies on emotion loss in existing codecs. This paper evaluates neural and legacy codecs using subjective and objective methods on emotion datasets like IEMOCAP. Our study identifies which codecs best preserve emotional information under various bitrate scenarios. We found that training codec models with both English and Chinese data had limited success in retaining emotional information in Chinese. Additionally, resynthesizing speech through these codecs degrades the performance of speech emotion recognition (SER), particularly for emotions like sadness, depression, fear, and disgust. Human listening tests confirmed these findings. This work guides future speech technology developments to ensure new codecs maintain the integrity of emotional information in speech.</description>
