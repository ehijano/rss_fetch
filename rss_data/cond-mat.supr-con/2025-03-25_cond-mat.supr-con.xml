      <title>Observation of Persistent Zero Modes and Superconducting Vortex Doublets in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting vortices can reveal electron pairing details and nucleate topologically protected states. Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</description>

      <title>Broad-based experimental evidence for a hidden phase of cuprate coexistence with far-reaching implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of experimental data in the literature show thresholds that directly imply a coexistent superconductive (SC) and pseudogap (PG) phase that, to our knowledge, has not been previously identified. The data used emphasize the essences of d-wave cuprate SC, i.e., the superfluid density and the momentum dependence. For severe underdoping, these data imply that SC condenses conventionally onto the unaltered low-energy density-of-states of a high-temperature PG. Beyond a doping threshold, the high-temperature normal state is replaced, below the SC transition temperature, by a single energetically-favorable thermodynamic phase that embodies a more complex interplay of these orders. This previously hidden phase occupies a central portion of the SC dome, enhances the superfluid density by a factor of two or more to benefit applications, can resolve thirteen mysteries in the literature and suggests an alternative approach to cuprate SC.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic superconductivity in the quasi-one-dimensional superconductor V$_2$Ga$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermetallic quasi-one-dimensional binary superconductor V$_2$Ga$_5$ was recently found to exhibit a topologically nontrivial normal state, making it a natural candidate for a topological superconductor (TSC). By combining dc-magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon-spin rotation ({$\mu$SR) measurements on high-quality V$_2$Ga$_5$ single crystals, we investigate the electronic properties of its normal- and superconducting (SC) ground states. NMR measurements in the normal state indicate a strong anisotropy in both the line shifts and the relaxation rates. Such anisotropy persists also in the superconducting state, as shown by the magnetization- and $\mu$SR-spectroscopy results. In the latter case, data collected at different temperatures, pressures, and directions of the magnetic field evidence a fully-gapped, strongly anisotropic superconductivity. At the same time, hydrostatic pressure is shown to only lower the $T_c$ value, but not to change the superfluid density nor its temperature dependence. Lastly, we discuss the search for topological signatures in the normal state of V$_2$Ga$_5$, as well as a peak splitting in the FFT of the $\mu$SR spectrum, possibly related to an unconventional vortex lattice. Our results suggest that V$_2$Ga$_5$ is a novel system, whose anisotropy plays a key role in determining its unusual electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interference and spectral function of the UTe$_2$ superconductive surface band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Strain manipulation of charge density wave and Mott-insulating states in monolayer VTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer vanadium ditelluride (VTe2) has recently been shown to host a Mott-insulating state that is intertwined with a 2{\sqrt{3}}*2{\sqrt{3}} charge density wave (CDW) order. However, the physical mechanisms driving the emergence of CDW order and its relationship with the Mott-insulating state are still not well understood. Unveiling the underlying physical mechanisms and exploring effective methods to modulate both CDW order and Mott-insulating state in monolayer VTe2 is therefore important. In this study, we systematically investigate the electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of monolayer VTe2 under the influence of biaxial strain. Our results reveal that the formation of CDW orders primarily arises from strong EPC effects. The narrowing of the bandwidth due to the CDW order, combined with the correlation effect of the V-3d orbital, collectively drives the system into a Mott-insulating state. Furthermore, we find that compressive strain significantly enhances the CDW order, while tensile strain suppresses it. Notably, beyond a threshold of {\epsilon} = 2% tensile strain, the CDW instability is entirely suppressed, paving the way for the emergence of a superconducting state. Our results establish that the CDW, Mott, and superconducting states in monolayer VTe2 can be effectively modulated through strain engineering, thereby advancing the understanding of the complex interplay between these correlated quantum states in VTe2.</description>

      <title>Electron pairing by dispersive phonons in altermagnets: re-entrant superconductivity and continuous transition to finite momentum superconducting state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an altermagnet subject to the electron attractive potential mediated by the dispersive phonons. While altermagnetism suppresses superconductivity, scattering of electrons on the Fermi surface by thermal phonons suppresses altermagnetism. We show that this leads to the re-entrant superconductivity over temperature and to the stabilization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) finite momentum superconducting state at low temperatures. The effect is mediated by the retardation effects and no d-wave pairing interaction is required.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in co-doped infinite-layer samarium nickelate thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small c-axis parameter of 3.26 {\AA} and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. We observe distinct magnetotransport behaviors in europium-containing samples, including negative magnetoresistance and field-enhanced superconductivity. By establishing a clear correlation between decreasing c-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems, these findings establish clear materials design principles for achieving higher transition temperatures in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</description>

      <title>Identifying Majorana edge and end modes in Josephson junction of $p$-wave superconductor with magnetic barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.</description>

      <title>Emergent ferromagnetic ladder excitations in heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional spin fluctuations play a crucial role in unconventional superconductors, with quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations potentially linked with spin-triplet superconductivity. The heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_2$ exhibits an unusual large inverted S-shaped upper critical field that suggests a possible triplet pairing state within its pressure-induced superconducting dome. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb$_2$ emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the "rungs" of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above $T_{\rm N}$, suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has sparked significant interest in understanding their pairing mechanism and correlated states. While previous theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has been neglected, leaving its effect unexplored and elusive. In this work, we comprehensively explore the effect of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion on both superconductivity and density-wave orders in the presence of onsite interactions by performing functional renormalization group calculations. We find that interlayer repulsion suppresses the interlayer intra-orbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave order, while driving a transition to an interlayer inter-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing and a mirror-symmetry breaking charge order. This transition occurs across a wide range of charge doping and is independent of the presence of the $\gamma$ pocket around M point. Remarkably, the critical scale of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, suggesting that the former pairing is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Additionally, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion promotes an in-plane charge density wave order with a vector of $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings highlight profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and the robustness of interlayer pairing associated with the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, advancing the understanding of the complex correlation effects within bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U&lt;2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U&gt;2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS component is admixed.</description>

      <title>In-plane magnetic field-induced orbital FFLO superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</description>

      <title>Individual and cooperative superexchange enhancement in cuprates</title>

Abstract: It is now widely accepted that the antiferromagnetic coupling within high temperature superconductors strongly exhibits a profound correlation with the upper limit of superconducting transition temperature these materials can reach. Thus, accurately calculating the positive and negative mechanisms that influence magnetic coupling in specific materials is crucial for the exploration of superconductivity at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, it is notoriously difficult to establish a complete description of electron correlations employing ab initio theories because of the large number of orbitals involved. In this study, we tackle the challenge of achieving high-level ab initio wave function theory calculations, which allow an explicit treatment of electron correlations associated with a large number of high-energy orbitals. We elucidate the atomic-shell-wise contributions to the superexchange coupling in the lanthanum cuprate, including individual effects of high-energy orbitals (Cu 4d, 5d, 4f, 5p) and cooperative effects between the core and these high-energy orbitals. Specifically, the prominent contributions from Cu 4d, 5d, 4f and 5p give rise to a rich collection of previously unexamined superexchange channels. We propose a p-d-f model to universally account for the contributions of high-energy orbitals at copper sites. Our calculations and physical rationalizations offer a more robust theoretical foundation for investigating cuprate-type high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Field-free Josephson diode effect in interacting chiral quantum dot junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free JD based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.</description>

      <title>Inverse Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>

Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Interaction tuned pattern-selective superconductivity: Application to the dodecagonal quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasicrystals exhibit superconductivity under the unique interplay of long-range order and strong inhomogeneity, distinguishing them from both crystalline and amorphous systems. Understanding how this structural complexity affects superconducting states and phase transitions remains an important open question. Here, we unveil anomalous superconductivity in a dodecagonal quasicrystal using the attractive Hubbard model within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We show that both the gap structure and critical temperature depend on the local pattern due to inhomogeneous charge distribution and kinetic terms. This leads to unconventional phase transitions between mixed phases where superconducting and normal metal regions coexist, even without external fields, which we term pattern-selective superconductivity. Furthermore, superconductivity can be anomalously suppressed even under stronger attractive interactions due to the alignment of the Fermi level with a spectral gap in the fragmented Hartree-shifted spectrum. These findings, not observed in conventional crystals, amorphous systems, or previous studies of quasicrystal superconductivity, highlight the distinct role of quasicrystalline order.</description>

      <title>Fate of poor man's Majoranas in the long Kitaev chain limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</description>
