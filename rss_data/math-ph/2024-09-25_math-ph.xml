      <title>Entropic Fluctuations in Statistical Mechanics II. Quantum Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Evans-Searles, respectively Gallavotti-Cohen, fluctuation theorem concerns certain universal statistical features of the entropy production rate of a classical system in a transient, respectively steady, state. In this paper, we consider and compare several possible extensions of these fluctuation theorems to quantum systems. In addition to the direct two-time measurement approach whose discussion is based on (LMP 114:32 (2024)), we discuss a variant where measurements are performed indirectly on an auxiliary system called ancilla, and which allows to retrieve non-trivial statistical information using ancilla state tomography. We also show that modular theory provides a way to extend the classical notion of phase space contraction rate to the quantum domain, which leads to a third extension of the fluctuation theorems. We further discuss the quantum version of the principle of regular entropic fluctuations, introduced in the classical context in (Nonlinearity 24, 699 (2011)). Finally, we relate the statistical properties of these various notions of entropy production to spectral resonances of quantum transfer operators. The obtained results shed a new light on the nature of entropic fluctuations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicitly a Kac-Moody algebra associated to SL$(2, \mathbb R)$ in two different but equivalent ways: either by identifying a Hilbert basis of $L^2($SL$(2, \mathbb R))$ or by the Plancherel Theorem. Central extensions and Hermitean differential operators are identified.</description>

      <title>Brown measures of deformed $L^\infty$-valued circular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$, where $a$ lies in a commutative tracial von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathfrak{c}$ is a $\mathcal{B}$-valued circular element. Under certain regularity conditions on $a$ and the covariance of $\mathfrak{c}$ this Brown measure has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the complex plane which is real analytic apart from jump discontinuities at the boundary of its support. With the exception of finitely many singularities this one-dimensional spectral edge is real analytic. We provide a full description of all possible edge singularities as well as all points in the interior, where the density vanishes. The edge singularities are classified in terms of their local edge shape while internal zeros of the density are classified in terms of the shape of the density locally around these points. We also show that each of these countably infinitely many singularity types occurs for an appropriate choice of $a$ when $\mathfrak{c}$ is a standard circular element. The Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$ arises as the empirical spectral distribution of a diagonally deformed non-Hermitian random matrix with independent entries when its dimension tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity surfaces from random permutons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutons constructed from a Liouville quantum gravity surface and a pair of space-filling Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLEs) have been shown -- or are conjectured -- to describe the scaling limit of various natural models of random constrained permutations. We prove that, in two distinct and natural settings, these permutons uniquely determine, modulo rotation, scaling, translation and reflection, both the Liouville quantum gravity surface and the pair of space-filling SLEs used in their construction. In other words, the Liouville quantum gravity surface and the pair of space-filling SLEs can be deterministically reconstructed from the permuton.
  Our results cover the cases of the skew Brownian permutons, the universal limits of pattern-avoiding permutations, and the meandric permuton, which is the conjectural permuton limit of permutations obtained from uniform meanders.
  In the course of the proof, we give a detailed description of how the support of the permuton relates to the multiple points of the two space-filling SLEs.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also give an identification of the ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model, which proves that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic. This isomorphism also provides a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles that appear in the latter ring.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetries, closed-form solutions, and conservation laws of a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n &gt; 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are established by utilizing different combinations of Lie symmetries, both for general n and for the specific case where n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n &gt; 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.</description>

      <title>Hessian Spectrum at the Ground State in Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the bulk Hessian spectrum at approximate ground states in any spherical spin glass. Marginal stability, the presence of many near-zero Hessian eigenvalues, is shown to be equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking near overlap $1$ at zero temperature. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, which has geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for certain vector spin glass models. For generic spin glasses, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Dynamical Decoupling for (Almost) Any Spin-Boson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is a technique aimed at suppressing the interaction between a quantum system and its environment by applying frequent unitary operations on the system alone. In the present paper, we analytically study the dynamical decoupling of a two-level system coupled with a structured bosonic environment initially prepared in a thermal state. We find sufficient conditions under which dynamical decoupling works for such systems, and, most importantly, we find bounds for the convergence speed of the procedure. Our analysis is based on a new Trotter theorem for multiple Hamiltonians and involves a rigorous treatment of the evolution of mixed quantum states via unbounded Hamiltonians. A comparison with numerical experiments shows that our bounds reproduce the correct scaling in various relevant system parameters. Furthermore, our analytical treatment allows for quantifying the decoupling efficiency for boson baths with infinitely many modes, in which case a numerical treatment is unavailable.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Class of Two-delay Fractional Differential Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differential equations involving two discrete delays are helpful in modeling two different processes in one model. We provide the stability and bifurcation analysis in the fractional order delay differential equation $D^\alpha x(t)=a x(t)+b x(t-\tau)-b x(t-2\tau)$ in the $ab$-plane. Various regions of stability include stable (S), unstable (U), single stable region (SSR), and stability switch (SS). In the stable region, the system is stable for all the delay values. The region SSR has a critical value of delay that bifurcates the stable and unstable behavior. Switching of stable and unstable behaviors is observed in the SS region.</description>

      <title>Quantum systems coupled to environments via mean field interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that when a quantum system is coupled to an environment in a mean field way, then its effective dynamics is governed by a unitary group with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The time-dependent modification of the bare system Hamiltonian is given by an explicit term involving the reservoir state. We show that entanglement within the system state is not changed during the dynamics. Our results hold for arbitrary strengths of the system-environment coupling, and for finite or infinite dimensional systems. As an application we show that the qualitative dynamical features of an $N$-body system can be altered drastically by the contact with the environment. For instance, bound states can turn into scattering states and vice-versa.</description>

      <title>A new penalty method for elliptic quasivariational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of elliptic quasivariational inequalities in a reflexive Banach space $X$ for which we recall a convergence criterion obtained in [10]. Each inequality $\cal P$ in the class is governed by a set of constraints $K$ and has a unique solution $u\in K$. The criterion provides necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee that an arbitrary sequence $\{u_n\}\subset X$ converges to the solution $u$. Then, we consider a sequence $\{\cal P_n\}$ of unconstrained variational-hemivariational inequalities governed by a sequence of parameters $\{\lambda_n\}\subset\mathbb{R}_+$. We use our criterion to deduce that, if for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ the term $u_n$ represents a solution of Problem $\cal P_n$, then the sequence $\{u_n\}$ converges to $u$ as $\lambda_n\to 0$. We apply our abstract results in the study of an elastic frictional contact problem with unilateral constraints and provide the corresponding mechanical interpretations. We also present numerical simulation in the study of a two-dimensional example which represents an evidence of our convergence results.</description>

Abstract: We prove the universality of the joint distribution of an eigenvalue and the corresponding diagonal eigenvector overlap, in the bulk and at the edge, for eigenvalues of complex matrices and real eigenvalues of real matrices. As part of the proof we obtain a bound for the least non-zero singular value of $X-z$ when $z$ is an edge eigenvalue and a bound for the inner product between left and right singular vectors of $X-z$ when $|z|=1+O(N^{-1/2})$.</description>

      <title>Percolation of discrete GFF in dimension two I. Arm events in the random walk loop soup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, which is the first part of a series of two papers, we study the random walk loop soup in dimension two. More specifically, we estimate the probability that two large connected components of loops come close to each other, in the subcritical and critical regimes. The associated four-arm event can be estimated in terms of exponents computed in the Brownian loop soup, relying on the connection between this continuous process and conformal loop ensembles (with parameter $\kappa \in (8/3,4]$).
  Along the way, we need to develop several useful tools for the loop soup, based on separation for random walks and surgery for loops, such as a "locality" property and quasi-multiplicativity. The results established here then play a key role in a second paper, in particular to study the connectivity properties of level sets in the random walk loop soup and in the discrete Gaussian free field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores classical discrete multiple orthogonal polynomials, including Hahn, Meixner of the first and second kinds, Kravchuk, and Charlier polynomials, with an arbitrary number of weights. Explicit expressions for the recursion coefficients of Hahn multiple orthogonal polynomials are derived. By leveraging the multiple Askey scheme and the recently discovered explicit hypergeometric representation of type I multiple Hahn polynomials, corresponding explicit hypergeometric representations are provided for the type I polynomials and recursion coefficients of all the aforementioned descendants within the Askey scheme. Additionally, integral representations for these families within the Hahn class in the Askey scheme are presented. The multiple Askey scheme is further completed by providing the corresponding limits for the weights, polynomials, and recurrence coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic formalism of inflation allows us to describe the scalar-field dynamics in a non-perturbative way. The correspondence between the diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations makes it possible to exhaustively construct analytical solutions in stochastic inflation. Those exact statistical quantities such as distribution and correlation functions have one-to-one correspondence to the exactly solvable solutions in non-relativistic quantum mechanics in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. A class of such solutions is presented by means of isospectral Hamiltonians with an underlying symmetry called shape invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study percolation of two-sided level sets for the discrete Gaussian free field (DGFF) in 2D. For a DGFF $\varphi$ defined in a box $B_N$ with side length $N$, we show that with high probability, there exist low crossings in the set of vertices $z$ with $|\varphi(z)|\le\varepsilon\sqrt{\log N}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, while the average and the maximum of $\varphi$ are of order $\sqrt{\log N}$ and $\log N$, respectively. Our method also strongly suggests the existence of such crossings below $C\sqrt{\log\log N}$, for $C$ large enough. As a consequence, we also obtain connectivity properties of the set of thick points of a random walk.
  We rely on an isomorphism between the DGFF and the random walk loop soup (RWLS) with critical intensity $\alpha=1/2$, and further extend our study to the occupation field of the RWLS for all subcritical intensities $\alpha\in(0,1/2)$. For the RWLS in $B_N$, we show that for $\lambda$ large enough, there exist low crossings of $B_N$, remaining below $\lambda$, even though the average occupation time is of order $\log N$. Our results thus uncover a non-trivial phase-transition for this highly-dependent percolation model.
  For both the DGFF and the occupation field of the RWLS, we further show that such low crossings can be found in the "carpet" of the RWLS - the set of vertices which are not in the interior of any cluster of loops.
  This work is the second part of a series of two papers. It relies heavily on tools and techniques developed for the RWLS in the first part, especially surgery arguments on loops, which were made possible by a separation result in the RWLS. This allowed us, in that companion paper, to derive several useful properties such as quasi-multiplicativity, and obtain a precise upper bound for the probability that two large connected components of loops "almost touch", which is instrumental here.</description>

      <title>The deformed Inozemtsev spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13066v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Inozemtsev chain is an exactly solvable interpolation between the short-range Heisenberg and long-range Haldane-Shastry (HS) chains. In order to unlock its potential to study spin interactions with tunable interaction range using the powerful tools of integrability, the model's mathematical properties require better understanding. As a major step in this direction, we present a new generalisation of the Inozemtsev chain with spin symmetry reduced to U(1), interpolating between a Heisenberg xxz chain and the xxz-type HS chain, and integrable throughout. Underlying it is a new quantum many-body system that extends the elliptic Ruijsenaars system by including spins, contains the trigonometric spin-Ruijsenaars-Macdonald system as a special case, and yields our spin chain by 'freezing'. Our models have potential applications from condensed-matter to high-energy theory, and provide a crucial step towards a general theory for long-range integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the trigonometric quantum spin-Calogero-Sutherland model, and the Haldane-Shastry spin chain as a special case, using a Bethe-ansatz analysis. We harness the model's Yangian symmetry to import the standard tools of integrability for Heisenberg spin chains into the world of integrable long-range models with spins. From the transfer matrix with a diagonal twist we construct Heisenberg-style symmetries (Bethe algebra) that refine the usual hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians (quantum determinant) of the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model. We compute the first few of these new conserved charges explicitly, and diagonalise them by Bethe ansatz inside each irreducible Yangian representation. This yields a new eigenbasis for the spin-Calogero-Sutherland model that generalises the Yangian Gelfand-Tsetlin basis of Takemura and Uglov. The Bethe-ansatz analysis involves non-generic values of the inhomogeneities. Our review of the inhomogeneous Heisenberg XXX chain, with special attention to how the Bethe ansatz works in the presence of fusion, may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>

Abstract: We present new explicit tight and overtwisted contact structures on the (round) 3-sphere and the (flat) 3-torus for which the ambient metric is weakly compatible. Our proofs are based on the construction of nonvanishing curl eigenfields using suitable families of Jacobi or trigonometric polynomials. As a consequence, we show that the contact sphere theorem of Etnyre, Komendarczyk and Massot (2012) does not hold for weakly compatible metric as it was conjectured. We also establish a geometric rigidity for tight contact structures by showing that any contact form on the 3-sphere admitting a compatible metric that is the round one is isometric, up to a constant factor, to the standard (tight) contact form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the one-loop quantum entanglement entropy in ten-dimensional Type-II string theory using the orbifold method by analytically continuing in $N$ the genus-one partition function for string orbifolds on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$ conical spaces known for all odd integers $N &gt; 1$. We show that the tachyonic contributions to the orbifold partition function can be appropriately summed and analytically continued to an expression that is finite in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ resulting in a finite and calculable answer for the entanglement entropy. We discuss the implications of the finiteness of the entanglement entropy for the information paradox, quantum gravity, and holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological polytope and bootstrap programs have revealed interesting connections between positive geometries, modern on-shell methods and bootstrap principles studied in the amplitudes community with the wavefunction of the Universe in toy models of FRW cosmologies. To compute these FRW correlators, one often faces integrals that are too difficult to evaluate by direct integration. Borrowing from the Feynman integral community, the method of (canonical) differential equations provides an efficient alternative for evaluating these integrals. Moreover, we further develop our geometric understanding of these integrals by describing the associated \emph{relative} twisted cohomology. Leveraging recent progress in our understanding of relative twisted cohomology in the Feynman integral community, we give an algorithm to predict the basis size and simplify the computation of the differential equations satisfied by FRW correlators.</description>

      <title>Studying ballistic aggregation phenomena through efficient Time Stepping approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of simulating dense dispersed systems composed by large numbers of particles undergoing ballistic aggregation. The most classical approaches for dealing with such problems are represented by the so-called event-driven methods. Despite being more accurate, these methods become computationally very expensive as the number of particles increases. Typically, their computational cost is proportional to the square of the number of particles and thus they become extremely demanding as soon as this number becomes sufficiently large. An alternative approach, called time-stepping, consists in evolving the problem over small time-intervals and to handle all collisions occurring during each time interval simultaneously. In this work, we follow this second direction and we introduce a new time stepping method which recasts the problem of the multiple collisions in a minimization framework. The objective of this work is twofold, first to show that the statistical description of the resulting aggregates obtained with this new time stepping method is sufficiently close to that of the event driven methods. The second goal consists in showing that the computational performance considerably improve when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large. Numerical results obtained in the case of spherical particles moving in a two dimensional box show that these two properties are indeed satisfied by this new method.</description>

Abstract: We consider $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of Type-II compactifications to four and six dimensions on several Calabi-Yau manifolds in the orbifold limit with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy. The spectrum can contain tachyons in the doubly-twisted sectors which can lead to new infrared divergences for the partition function that are not present in the orbifolds of the uncompactified ten-dimensional theory. We show that all tachyonic contributions in these models admit a resummation and analytic continuation that yields finite entropy in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ just as in ten dimensions.</description>

We analyze the tachyonic contribution to the modular integrand for the partition function known for odd integers $N&gt;1$ and show that it admits an analytic continuation resulting in a finite answer for the modular integral in the physical region $0&lt; N \leq 1$. We discuss the flat space limit and the relevance of this computation for quantum gravity near black hole horizons and holography in relation to the thermal entropy.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Mechanism of Quasi-Halo Orbit from Lissajous Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general analytical method to describe the center manifolds of collinear libration points in the Restricted Three-body Problem (RTBP). It is well-known that these center manifolds include Lissajous orbits, halo orbits, and quasihalo orbits. Previous studies have traditionally treated these orbits separately by iteratively constructing high-order series solutions using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Instead of relying on resonance between their frequencies, this study identifies that halo and quasihalo orbits arise due to intricate coupling interactions between in-plane and out-of-plane motions. To characterize this coupling effect, a novel concept, coupling coefficient $\eta$, is introduced in the RTBP, incorporating the coupling term $\eta \Delta x$ in the $z$-direction dynamics equation, where $\Delta$ represents a formal power series concerning the amplitudes. Subsequently, a uniform series solution for these orbits is constructed up to a specified order using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. For any given paired in-plane and out-of-plane amplitudes, the coupling coefficient $\eta$ is determined by the bifurcation equation $\Delta = 0$. When $\eta$ = 0, the proposed solution describes Lissajous orbits around libration points. As $\eta$ transitions from zero to non-zero values, the solution describes quasihalo orbits, which bifurcate from Lissajous orbits. Particularly, halo orbits bifurcate from planar Lyapunov orbits if the out-of-plane amplitude is zero. The proposed method provides a unified framework for understanding these intricate orbital behaviors in the RTBP.</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positivity preservation is an important issue in the dynamics of open quantum systems: positivity violations always mark the border of validity of the model. We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$. These operators frequently appear in open quantum systems.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive, which yields a strong and quite easy test for positivity. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres-Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators having the same polynomial factor, which might improve any given positivity test by carrying it out on a much larger set of operators. We will show an example that this really can make positivity tests much more sensitive and efficient. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.</description>

      <title>A Modified Landau-de Gennes Theory for Smectic Liquid Crystals: Phase Transitions and Structural Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We mathematically model Smectic-A (SmA) phases with a modified Landau-de Gennes (mLdG) model. The orientational order of the SmA phase is described by a tensor-order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$, and the positional order is described by a real scalar $u$, which models the deviation from the average density of liquid crystal molecules. Firstly, we prove the existence and regularity of global minimisers of the mLdG free energy in three-dimensional settings. Then, we analytically prove that the mLdG model can capture the Isotropic-Nematic-Smectic phase transition as a function of temperature, under some assumptions. Further, we explore stable smectic phases on a square domain, with edge length $\lambda$, and tangent boundary conditions. We use heuristic arguments to show that defects repel smectic layers and strong nematic ordering promotes layer formation. We use asymptotic arguments in the $\lambda\to 0$ and $\lambda\to\infty$ limits which reveal the correlation between the number and thickness of smectic layers, the amplitude of density fluctuations with the phenomenological parameters in the mLdG energy. For finite values of $\lambda$, we numerically recover BD-like and D-like stable smectic states observed in experiments. We also study the frustrated mLdG energy landscape and give numerical examples of transition pathways between distinct mLdG energy minimisers.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>New canonical analysis for consistent extension of $\lambda R$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical analysis of the $\lambda R$ model extended with the term due to Blas, Pujolas, and Sibiryakov $[BPS]$ is performed. The analysis is developed for any value of $\lambda$, but particular attention is paid to the point $\lambda=\frac{1}{3}$ because of the closeness with linearized General Relativity [GR]. Then, we add the higher-order conformal term, the so-called Cotton-square term, to study the constraint structure of what constitutes an example of kinetic-conformal Horava's gravity. At the conformal point, an extra second-class constraint appears; this does not arise at other values of $\lambda$. Then, the Dirac brackets are constructed, and we will observe that the $\lambda R$-Cotton-square model shares the same number of degrees of freedom with linearized $GR$.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy-Driven Flows With Navier-Slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this dissertation two-dimensional buoyancy-driven flows are investigated. While usually the Navier-Stokes equations are equipped with no-slip boundary conditions here we focus on the Navier-slip conditions that, depending on the system at hand, better reflect the physical behavior. In particular, we study two systems, Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and a closely related problem without thermal diffusion. In the former, bounds on the vertical heat transfer, given by the Nusselt number, with respect to the strength of the buoyancy force, characterized by the Rayleigh number, are derived. These bounds hold for a broad range of applications, allowing for non-flat boundaries, any sufficiently smooth positive slip coefficient, and are valid over all ranges of the Prandtl number, a system parameter determined by the fluid. For the thermally non-diffusive system, regularity estimates are proven. Up to a certain order, these bounds hold uniformly in time, which, combined with estimates for their growth, provide insight into the long-time behavior. In particular, solutions converge to the hydrostatic equilibrium, where the fluid's velocity vanishes and the buoyancy force is balanced by the pressure gradient.</description>
