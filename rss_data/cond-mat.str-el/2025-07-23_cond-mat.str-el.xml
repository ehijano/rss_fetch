      <title>Generalized symmetry enriched criticality in (3+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between two gapped phases: one in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and another where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits this transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian parameter inference from RIXS spectra with active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3, NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3, that were previously missing from the literature.</description>

      <title>Stoner Transition at Finite Temperature in a 2D Isotropic Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a mean-field analysis of the temperature evolution of a ferromagnetic Stoner transition in a two-dimensional (2D) system with an isotropic dispersion $\varepsilon_k \propto k^{2\alpha}$, which for $\alpha &gt;1$ models flat dispersions in various multi-layer graphene systems in a displacement field. This study is an extension to a finite $T$ of previous studies at $T=0$, which found both first-order and second-order Stoner transitions, depending on the value of $\alpha$ and special behavior at $\alpha =1$ and $\alpha =2$. We find that the Stoner transition at a finite $T$ displays new features not seen at $T=0$. The most interesting one is the reentrant behavior, where the ordered state emerges as temperature is increased. This behavior develops at $\alpha &gt;1.4$ and the range where it holds increases with $\alpha$. We conjecture that the reentrant behavior is the fundamental feature of the Stoner transition in 2D, not sensitive to the details of the electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Unconventional charge density wave in Kagome metal BaFe2Al9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally, CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems. Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Electron doping in single crystalline BaBiO$_3$: BaBiO$_{3-x}$F$_{x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators are a new class of insulators with conducting surface state. Most of the topological insulators are chalcogenides, where a tiny amount of chalcogen vacancy destroys the predicted bulk insulating state and results in a metallic or semimetallic bulk electrical transport. BaBiO$_3$ (BBO) is an interesting large bandgap (0.7 eV) insulator that upon hole doping becomes a superconductor and is theoretically predicted to show a topological insulating state under electron doping. We have explored electron doping through the chemical substitution of fluorine atoms at the oxygen site. The single crystals of BBO and fluorine doped BBO were synthesized via a one-step solid-state technique. The single crystals of pure BBO and 10 % F -doped BBO (BaBiO$_{2.7}$F$_{0.3}$) are chemically single-phase samples and crystallize in monoclinic I2/m crystal structure. The core level and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra confirm electron doping in the 10% fluorine-doped BBO. 20 % F-doped BBO appears to be a multiphase sample, confirmed by back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging and X-ray diffraction. This article reports on the successful growth of pure and F-doped BBO using a one-step solid-state technique and discusses the effect of F-doping on structural and electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized and robust tunable monochromatic magneto-optical platform for pulsed magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission is one of the most established magneto-optical techniques, particularly well suited for pulsed magnetic fields. It employs fixed-wavelength monochromatic light as the probe, while the magnetic field is swept to bring the sample into resonance with the photon energy. The key component of this setup is a tunable laser system, typically consisting of a Ti:sapphire laser coupled with an optical parametric oscillator. However, such laser systems are often bulky, expensive, and inherently unstable, which significantly limits their widespread application in magneto-optical laboratories. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy, cost-effective, and compact tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission system based on a combination of a laser-driven white light source and a mini monochromator, and demonstrate its feasibility and performance in a millisecond-range pulsed magnetic field condition. To verify the accuracy of this new and simplified setup, we performed Faraday rotation measurements on the geometrically frustrated spin system CdCr2O4, as well as magneto-transmission experiments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice antiferromagnet SrCu2(BO3)2. These results show excellent agreement with previous reports, confirming the reliability and precision of the new setup.</description>

      <title>Exciton photoemission from a ground state of a solid Ta2Pd3Te5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons are bosonic quasiparticles with a variety of applications in optoelectronics, photosyn thesis, and dissipationless informatics, and their lifetime can become sufficiently long to form a quantum condensate. While exciton condensation has been predicted to occur as a ground state of a solid, so called an excitonic insulator, whose material realization has been elusive. Here we report the observation of direct photoemission signals from excitons in a ground state of a very recent excitonic insulator candidate Ta2Pd3Te5 below its metal-insulator transition temperature using orbital-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the excitons have a lower energy than the valence band maximum to possibly drive the phase transition. This measurement further discloses the size and the unusual odd parity of the exciton wave function. The present finding opens an avenue toward applications of coherent excitons in solid systems and searching for exotic quantum phases of exciton condensates.</description>

      <title>"Odd" Toric Code in a tilted field: Higgs-confinement multicriticality, spontaneous self-duality symmetry breaking, and valence bond solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of an ``odd'' variant of the two-dimensional Ising Fradkin--Shenker model, characterized by a uniform background of static $e$ and $m$ charges. Using large-scale tensor network and exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram, identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic excitations are related by an enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation, translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking. Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond commensurate limits.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall transport in Kitaev spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Ordering and Elastocaloric Effect in TmVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth material TmVO$_4$ shows ferro-quadrupolar order below a critical temperature which can be tuned by various parameters such as a magnetic field, a strain field, chemical composition, and nuclear spin coupling to its non-Kramers electronic doublets. In this work, we study a pseudo-spin-1/2 model to understand the various phases in TmVO$_4$. The model captures coupled electronic and nuclear orders via (i) a ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller interaction, (ii) a $B_{1g}$ shear strain, (iii) a transverse magnetic field, and (iv) a weak on-site nuclear hyperfine coupling A. At zero transverse magnetic and strain fields, electronic quadrupoles undergo a second-order transition at $T_Q$, lowering the entropy per site from ln 4 to ln 2. At a much lower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective nuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the remaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize smoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover. In contrast, adiabatic $B_{1g}$ strain sweeps across the two ordering temperatures yielding a pronounced two-step elastocaloric effect, highlighting TmVO$_4$ as a tunable strain-driven solid-state refrigerant.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Correlation Effects in DC and Optical Conductivity of the Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conductivity is one of the most direct probes of electronic systems, yet its theoretical description remains challenging in the presence of strong non-local correlations. In this Letter, we analyze the conductivity of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model and identify the role of spatial correlations across the Mott transition. We show that in the correlated metallic regime, an accurate description of the conductivity requires not only the correct spectral function but also the inclusion of complex multi-electron processes encoded in vertex corrections. The crossover to the Mott insulating regime is marked by a vanishing contribution of vertex corrections to the DC conductivity. However, in the Mott insulating case, vertex corrections remain significant for the optical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Trimer superfluidity of antiparallel dipolar excitons in a bilayer heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a bilayer of antiparallel dipolar excitons with a 1:2 density ratio between the layers, as a function of temperature and density. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer. At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures is discussed.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory is a framework that aims to improve the results of Hamiltonian truncation in a systematic, order-by-order fashion using Effective Field Theory methodology. The result is a truncated effective Hamiltonian with corrections that result from a matching procedure. We establish the rigor of this method by calculating nontrival next-to-leading order corrections in a $1/E_{\rm max}$ expansion, where $E_{\rm max}$ is our effective theory cutoff. We illustrate this explicitly using 1+1D $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, calculating corrections up to order $1/E_{\rm max}^3$. At this order, novel nonlocal contributions to the matching conditions must be incorporated. We show that by including these nonlocal terms, the error scales as $1/E_{\rm max}^4$, as expected from the Effective Field Theory power counting, providing a nontrivial check that this method is consistent and robust. We also estimate the critical coupling at which this theory flows to the 2D Ising conformal field theory and confirm that separation of scales, an essential feature of Effective Field Theory, persists at this order. These results establish Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory as a generic, systematic framework for improving convergence in Hamiltonian truncation and lay the groundwork to apply this method to more complex systems in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological control of quantum speed limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a measure quantifying the sensitivity of a quantum state with respect to changes in tuning parameters in quantum metrology, and defining quantum speed limits. We show that even if the quantum state is completely dispersionless, QFI in this state remains momentum-resolved. We compute the QFI for topological phases at integer filling and demonstrate that each momentum-resolved term is fundamentally bounded by quantum geometric and topological invariants, with maximum QFI controlled by topological invariants (Chern number $|C|$). We also finds bounds on quantum speed limit which scales as $\sqrt{|C|}$ in a (dispersionless) topological phase. We conclude that quantum platforms of high Chern numbers $|C| \gg 1$, such as those featuring twisted multilayered van der Waals heterostructures, significantly enhance capacity for quantum Fisher information, and provide practical control over quantum speed limits.</description>

      <title>Mass-gap description of heavy impurities in Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</description>

      <title>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two-dimensional tensor network representations of finite groups carrying a 4-cocycle index. We characterize the associated gapped (2+1)D phases that emerge when these anomalous symmetries act on tensor network ground states. We further develop related tensor network unitaries that generate symmetric states representing (3+1)D symmetry protected topological phases. Although aspects of these constructions have been previously addressed, our contribution unifies them within a single tensor network framework and emphasizes the explicit formulation of local tensor equations encoding global consistency conditions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting boundary-driven method for transport: Finite-size effects and the role of system-bath coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding transport in interacting quantum many-body systems is a central challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Numerical studies typically rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in closed systems and Markovian dynamics governed by master equations for boundary-driven open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained from these two classes of methods remains an open question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ computed from the aforementioned two approaches. We find a clear mismatch between the two, with $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ exhibiting a strong dependence on the system-bath coupling for the boundary-driven technique, highlighting fundamental limitations of such a method in calculating the transport coefficients related to asymptotic dynamical behavior of the system. We trace the origin of this mismatch to the incorrect order of limits of time $t \rightarrow \infty$ and system size $L\rightarrow \infty$, which we argue to be intrinsic to boundary-driven setups. As a practical resolution, we advocate computing only time-dependent transport coefficients within the boundary-driven framework, which show excellent agreement with those obtained from the Kubo formalism based on closed-system dynamics, up to a timescale set by the system size. This leads us to interpret the sensitivity of the dc diffusion constant on the system-bath coupling strength in an open system as a potential diagnostic for finite-size effects.</description>

Abstract: The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a boundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new physics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the formal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge modes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the bulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs with boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be associated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in order to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the prediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall systems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a physical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum Field Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have non-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining symmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the boundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which also appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a possible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton quasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the algebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never proved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter, elasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this Thesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar gauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of a Disorder Driven Electronic Smectic Phase in Nonsymmorphic Square-Net Semimetal GdSbTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18893v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of a smectic phase in a weakly correlated nonsymmorphic square-net semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure, which coexist with Dirac fermions across Fermi level, are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As materials with highly mobile carriers are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, Dirac fermions and electron correlation.</description>

Abstract: We study the boundary criticality enriched by boundary fermions, which ubiquitously emerge in topological phases of matter, with a focus on topological insulators and topological superconductors. By employing dimensional regularization and bosonization techniques, we uncover several unprecedented boundary universality classes. These include the boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point and the special Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, both resulting from the interplay between edge modes and bulk bosons. We present a comprehensive sketch of the phase diagram that accommodates these boundary criticalities and delineate their critical exponents. Additionally, we explore a 1+1D conformal defect decorated with fermions, where a defect BKT transition is highlighted. We conclude with a discussion on potential experimental realizations of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Towards a Topological Proof of the Strong Subadditivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological entanglement entropy (TEE) represents an intrinsic contribution to the entanglement entropy (EE) in topologically ordered systems. In quantum information theory, strong subadditivity (SSA) is a fundamental property of EE, reflecting the non-negativity of conditional mutual information. TEE was originally believed to be a universal correction to the area law of EE, suggesting that its SSA would directly follow from the SSA of EE. However, due to spurious contributions, the correction term is not universal; consequently, the value predicted by topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides only a lower bound. In this work, we present a topological analysis showing that the SSA for TEE is equivalent to a specific inequality within the TQFT framework. We further verify that this inequality holds for all known unitary modular tensor categories (UMTCs) up to rank 11, supporting the conjecture that SSA holds universally in the TQFT framework. Conversely, assuming the validity of the SSA condition, the inequality can be interpreted as a consistency criterion for candidate UMTCs.</description>

Abstract: Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n&gt;4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.</description>

The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order.

Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit crossover and the origin of magnetic torque in kagome metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a curious phase transition-like feature: a nematic magnetic torque response that abruptly sets in at $T_\tau \approx 130$K, above the known charge density wave transition at $T_\text{CDW} \approx 100$K. Counterintuitively, elastoresistance measurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal, ruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on possible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for in-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane magnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination of features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband magnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial symmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain field, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural explanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\tau$ is understood as a crossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength. Our theory accounts for the nematic magnetic torque, hysteresis, and the transition-like onset at $T_\tau$, while also making testable predictions, including strain-induced magnetisation. In doing so, it challenges the prevailing view of the normal state.</description>

Abstract: The Haldane phase with local SU(3) adjoint representation constitutes the simplest non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases in the SU($N&gt;2$) Heisenberg spin chains. In this paper, we propose a quantum simulation of this phase using a two-species spinor Bose gas. The system consists of two interlaced, species-dependent zigzag optical lattices, where the two species label the quark and antiquark states of SU(3) symmetry. In the strong-coupling limit, we determine the ground-state phase diagram, and identify a quantum phase transition from the Haldane phase to a dimer phase. We characterize the Haldane phase through its experimental signatures, including edge modes, nonlocal string order, and entanglement spectra. To further understand these observations at the dimer phase, we construct an explicit ground-state ansatz at the dimer point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis fulfilled. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>

Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cooper pairing in nano-patterned metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02665</link>

Abstract: Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to Weyl's law and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic Schr\"odinger cat states in monoaxial chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with a monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, our analysis reveals a degeneracy between skyrmion and antiskyrmion states, enabling the formation of a mesoscopic Schr\"odinger cat state - a quantum superposition of these topologically distinct textures. To characterize this nontrivial state, we compute two-point spin correlation functions, highlighting signatures accessible via neutron scattering experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying a magnetic field gradient induces a coherent time evolution of the cat state, offering a controllable mechanism for its manipulation. These findings provide a framework for the detection of skyrmionic Schr\"odinger cat states in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Partition function zeros of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Exact spin helix eigenstates in the anisotropic spin-$s$ Heisenberg model with arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin helix states-characterized by their spatially modulated spin textures-are exact eigenstates of the one-dimensional anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model under specific parameter conditions. In this work, we extend this framework by constructing exact spin helix eigenstates for the fully anisotropic XYZ Heisenberg model with arbitrary spatial dimensions and arbitrary spin quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that some non-trivial exact eigenstates can persist beyond the integrable regime. The XXZ and XY cases are also analyzed to clarify the conditions for the emergence of spin helix eigenstates and their key properties. Our results broaden the class of analytically tractable exact eigenstates in non-integrable systems and deepen understanding of spin modulation states in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating generalised fluids via interacting wave packets evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional integrable and quasi-integrable systems display, on macroscopic scales, a universal form of transport known as Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD). In its standard Euler-scale formulation, GHD mirrors the equations of a two-dimensional compressible fluid but ignores fluctuations and becomes numerically unwieldy as soon as integrability-breaking perturbations are introduced. We show that GHD can be efficiently simulated as a gas of semiclassical wave packets - a natural generalisation of hard-rod particles - whose trajectories are efficiently mapped onto those of point particles. This representation (i) provides a transparent route to incorporate integrability-breaking terms, and (ii) automatically embeds the exact fluctuating-hydrodynamics extension of GHD. The resulting framework enables fast, large-scale simulations of quasi-integrable systems even in the presence of complicated integrability-breaking perturbations. It also manifest the pivotal role of two-point correlations in systems confined by external potentials: we demonstrate that situations where local one-point observables appear thermalised can nevertheless sustain long-lived, far-from-equilibrium long-range correlations for arbitrarily long times, signaling that, differently from what previously stated, true thermalisation is not reached at diffusive time-scales.</description>
