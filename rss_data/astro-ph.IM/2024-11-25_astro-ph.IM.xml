      <title>AKRA 2.0: Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic shear surveys serve as a powerful tool for mapping the underlying matter density field, including non-visible dark matter. A key challenge in cosmic shear surveys is the accurate reconstruction of lensing convergence ($\kappa$) maps from shear catalogs impacted by survey boundaries and masks, which seminal Kaiser-Squires (KS) method are not designed to handle. To overcome these limitations, we previously proposed the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm (AKRA), a prior-free maximum likelihood map-making method. Initially designed for flat sky scenarios with periodic boundary conditions, AKRA has proven successful in recovering high-precision $\kappa$ maps from masked shear catalogs. In this work, we upgrade AKRA to AKRA 2.0 by integrating the tools designed for spherical geometry. This upgrade employs spin-weighted spherical harmonic transforms to reconstruct the convergence field over the full sky. To optimize computational efficiency, we implement a scale-splitting strategy that segregates the analysis into two parts: large-scale analysis on the sphere (referred to as AKRA-sphere) and small-scale analysis on the flat sky (referred to as AKRA-flat); the results from both analyses are then combined to produce final reconstructed $\kappa$ map. We tested AKRA 2.0 using simulated shear catalogs with various masks, demonstrating that the reconstructed $\kappa$ map by AKRA 2.0 maintains high accuracy. For the reconstructed $\kappa$ map in unmasked regions, the reconstructed convergence power spectrum $C_\kappa^{\rm{rec}}$ and the correlation coefficient with the true $\kappa$ map $r_\ell$ achieve accuracies of $(1-C_\ell^{\rm{rec}}/C_\ell^{\rm{true}}) \lesssim 1\%$ and $(1-r_\ell) \lesssim 1\%$, respectively. Our algorithm is capable of straightforwardly handling further issues such as inhomogeneous shape measurement noise, which we will address in subsequent analysis.</description>

      <title>RAMSES-yOMP: Performance Optimizations for the Astrophysical Hydrodynamic Simulation Code RAMSES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing an efficient code for large, multiscale astrophysical simulations is crucial in preparing the upcoming era of exascale computing. RAMSES is an astrophysical simulation code that employs parallel processing based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, it has limitations in computational and memory efficiency when using a large number of CPU cores. The problem stems from inefficiencies in workload distribution and memory allocation that inevitably occur when a volume is simply decomposed into domains equal to the number of working processors. We present RAMSES-yOMP, which is a modified version of RAMSES designed to improve parallel scalability. Major updates include the incorporation of Open Multi-Processing into the MPI parallelization to take advantage of both the shared and distributed memory models. Utilizing this hybrid parallelism in high-resolution benchmark simulations with full prescriptions for baryonic physics, we achieved a performance increase of a factor of 2 in the total run-time, while using 75% less memory and 30% less storage compared to the original code, when using the same number of processors. These improvements allow us to perform larger or higher-resolution simulations than what was feasible previously.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>

      <title>Mining double-line spectroscopic candidates in the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic survey using human-AI hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize a hybrid approach that integrates the traditional cross-correlation function (CCF) and machine learning to detect spectroscopic multi-systems, specifically focusing on double-line spectroscopic binary (SB2). Based on the ninth data release (DR9) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), which includes a medium-resolution survey (MRS) containing 29,920,588 spectra, we identify 27,164 double-line and 3124 triple-line spectra, corresponding to 7096 SB2 candidates and 1903 triple-line spectroscopic binary (SB3) candidates, respectively, representing about 1% of the selection dataset from LAMOST-MRS DR9. Notably, 70.1% of the SB2 candidates and 89.6% of the SB3 candidates are newly identified. Compared to using only the traditional CCF technique, our method significantly improves the efficiency of detecting SB2, saves time on visual inspections by a factor of four.</description>

      <title>Generalized Steppingstone Sampling: Efficient marginal likelihood estimation in gravitational wave analysis of Pulsar Timing Array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globally, Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments have revealed evidence supporting an existing gravitational wave background (GWB) signal in the PTA data set. Apart from acquiring more observations, the sensitivity of PTA experiments can be increased by improving the accuracy of the noise modeling. In PTA data analysis, noise modeling is conducted primarily using Bayesian statistics, relying on the marginal likelihood and Bayes factor to assess evidence. We introduce generalized steppingstone (GSS) as an efficient and accurate marginal likelihood estimation method for the PTA-Bayesian framework. This method enables cheaper estimates with high accuracy, especially when comparing expensive models such as the Hellings-Downs (HD) model or the overlap reduction function model (ORF). We demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of GSS for model selection and evidence calculation by reevaluating the evidence of previous analyses from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 15 yr data set and the European PTA (EPTA) second data release. We find similar evidence for the GWB compared to the one reported by the NANOGrav 15-year data set. Compared to the evidence reported for the EPTA second data release, we find a substantial increase in evidence supporting GWB across all data sets.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Assessment of Data Volume Reduction for IACTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy cosmic-rays generate air showers when they enter Earth's atmosphere. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is possible using either direct detection of shower particles at mountain altitudes, or with arrays of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). Advances in the technique and larger collection areas have increased the rate at which air-shower events can be captured, and the amount of data produced by modern high-time-resolution Cherenkov cameras. Therefore, Data Volume Reduction (DVR) has become critical for such telescope arrays, ensuring that only useful information is stored long-term. Given the vast amount of raw data, owing to the highest resolution and sensitivity, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will need robust data reduction strategies to ensure efficient handling and analysis. The CTAO data rates needs be reduced from hundreds of Petabytes (PB) per year to a few PB/year.
  This paper presents algorithms tailored for CTAO but also applicable for other arrays, focusing on selecting pixels likely to contain shower light. It describes and evaluates multiple algorithms based on their signal efficiency, noise rejection, and shower reconstruction. With a focus on a time-based clustering algorithm which demonstrates a notable enhancement in the retention of low-level signal pixels. Moreover, the robustness is assessed under different observing conditions, including detector defects. Through testing and analysis, it is shown that these algorithms offer promising solutions for efficient volume reduction in CTAO, addressing the challenges posed by the array's very large data volume and ensuring reliable data storage amidst varying observational conditions and hardware issues.</description>

      <title>A celestial reference frame derived from observations with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry Global Observing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We computed a celestial reference frame (CRF) from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Global Observing System (VGOS) data after five years of regular observations (155 multi-baseline 24-hour VGOS sessions until 2024.0). In this paper we document the source selection and scheduling strategies for the individual sessions, and investigate the effect of using this new VGOS CRF in the analysis of individual geodetic VLBI sessions. We carried out several comparisons with ICRF3-SX, and with VIE2023sx CRF which includes VLBI S/X data until 2024.0. Furthermore, we studied the effect of more frequent estimations of tropospheric parameters on the estimated CRF in the current VGOS network. We evaluated the VIE2023-VG CRF in the geodetic analysis of VGOS sessions where the source positions were fixed to either the VIE2023-VG CRF or to ICRF3-SX.
  Results: The current VIE2023-VG CRF is built with 1.39 million VGOS group delays and includes 418 radio sources, where 172 sources (41%) are introduced in only four research and development sessions alone. We show that the VIE2023-VG CRF has excellent source position precision. The median formal error from the least-squares adjustment is 30 microas for right ascension (scaled by cosine of declination) and 47 microas for declination. In terms of systematic distortions versus ICRF3-SX, the largest terms in the vector spherical harmonics up to the degree and order two, reach in absolute values around 60 microas, caused by correlations between the individual terms. Because of the lack of observations in the southern hemisphere, a constraint for a zero slope in declination difference with respect to ICRF3-SX is imposed in the global adjustment. Therefore, VGOS should prioritize the development of southern stations in order to limit the need for such constraints on the frame.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks should be achievable with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Classifying CHIME Fast Radio Bursts and Investigating Empirical Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic millisecond-duration astrophysical phenomena typically categorized as repeaters or non-repeaters. However, observational limitations may lead to misclassifications, suggesting a larger proportion of repeaters than currently identified. In this study, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs using data from the CHIME/FRB catalog, including both the first catalog and a recent repeater catalog. By employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms (k-means and HDBSCAN), we successfully segregate repeaters and non-repeaters into distinct clusters, identifying over 100 potential repeater candidates. Our analysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}\Delta t_{rw}$, ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}T_B$, and $r - \gamma$ correlations, which provide new insights into the physical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying potential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their origins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational data and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our understanding of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Advanced LIGO detector performance in the fourth observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On May 24th, 2023, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), joined by the Advanced Virgo and KAGRA detectors, began the fourth observing run for a two-year-long dedicated search for gravitational waves. The LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors have achieved an unprecedented sensitivity to gravitational waves, with an angle-averaged median range to binary neutron star mergers of 152 Mpc and 160 Mpc, and duty cycles of 65.0% and 71.2%, respectively, with a coincident duty cycle of 52.6%. The maximum range achieved by the LIGO Hanford detector is 165 Mpc and the LIGO Livingston detector 177 Mpc, both achieved during the second part of the fourth observing run. For the fourth run, the quantum-limited sensitivity of the detectors was increased significantly due to the higher intracavity power from laser system upgrades and replacement of core optics, and from the addition of a 300 m filter cavity to provide the squeezed light with a frequency-dependent squeezing angle, part of the A+ upgrade program. Altogether, the A+ upgrades led to reduced detector-wide losses for the squeezed vacuum states of light which, alongside the filter cavity, enabled broadband quantum noise reduction of up to 5.2 dB at the Hanford observatory and 6.1 dB at the Livingston observatory. Improvements to sensors and actuators as well as significant controls commissioning increased low frequency sensitivity. This paper details these instrumental upgrades, analyzes the noise sources that limit detector sensitivity, and describes the commissioning challenges of the fourth observing run.</description>

      <title>CompactObject: An open-source Python package for full-scope neutron star equation of state inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CompactObject package is an open-source software framework developed to constrain the neutron star equation of state (EOS) through Bayesian statistical inference. It integrates astrophysical observational constraints from X-ray timing, gravitational wave events, and radio measurements, as well as nuclear experimental constraints derived from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT). The package supports a diverse range of EOS models, including meta-model like and several physics-motivated EOS models. It comprises three independent components: an EOS generator module that currently provides seven EOS choices, a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation solver, that allows the determination of the Mass Radius and Tidal deformability as observables, and a comprehensive Bayesian inference workflow module, including a complete pipeline for implementing EOS Bayesian inference. Each component can be used independently in different scientific research contexts, such as nuclear physics and astrophysics. In addition, CompactObject is designed to work in synergy with existing software such as CompOSE, allowing the use of the CompOSE EOS database to extend the EOS options available.</description>

      <title>Deep Gaussian Process Emulation and Uncertainty Quantification for Large Computer Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer models are used as a way to explore complex physical systems. Stationary Gaussian process emulators, with their accompanying uncertainty quantification, are popular surrogates for computer models. However, many computer models are not well represented by stationary Gaussian processes models. Deep Gaussian processes have been shown to be capable of capturing non-stationary behaviors and abrupt regime changes in the computer model response. In this paper, we explore the properties of two deep Gaussian process formulations within the context of computer model emulation. For one of these formulations, we introduce a new parameter that controls the amount of smoothness in the deep Gaussian process layers. We adapt a stochastic variational approach to inference for this model, allowing for prior specification and posterior exploration of the smoothness of the response surface. Our approach can be applied to a large class of computer models, and scales to arbitrarily large simulation designs. The proposed methodology was motivated by the need to emulate an astrophysical model of the formation of binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Bayesian "Deep" Process Convolutions: An Application in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear matter power spectrum in cosmology describes how matter density fluctuations vary with scale in the universe, providing critical insights into large-scale structure formation. The matter power spectrum includes both smooth regions and highly oscillatory features. Cosmologists rely on noisy, multi-resolution realizations of large N-body simulations to study these phenomena, which require appropriate smoothing techniques to learn about underlying structures. We introduce a Bayesian Deep Process Convolution (DPC) model that flexibly adapts its smoothness parameter across the input space, enabling it to capture both smooth and variable structure within a single framework. The DPC model leverages common patterns across related functions to improve estimation in regions with sparse data. Compared to existing methods, the DPC model offers superior accuracy and uncertainty quantification in simulated data, and qualitatively superior performance with the cosmological data. This methodology will be useful in cosmology and other fields requiring flexible modeling of smooth nonstationary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Analysis with Calibrated Neural Quantile Estimation and Approximate Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in extracting information from current and upcoming surveys of cosmological Large-Scale Structure (LSS) is the limited availability of computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations. We introduce Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a new Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that leverages a large number of approximate simulations for training and a small number of high-fidelity simulations for calibration. This approach guarantees an unbiased posterior and achieves near-optimal constraining power when the approximate simulations are reasonably accurate. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that cosmological parameters can be inferred at field level from projected 2-dim dark matter density maps up to $k_{\rm max}\sim1.5\,h$/Mpc at $z=0$ by training on $\sim10^4$ Particle-Mesh (PM) simulations with transfer function correction and calibrating with $\sim10^2$ Particle-Particle (PP) simulations. The calibrated posteriors closely match those obtained by directly training on $\sim10^4$ expensive PP simulations, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Our method offers a practical and scalable framework for SBI of cosmological LSS, enabling precise inference across vast volumes and down to small scales.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 year Data Set: Removing pulsars one by one from the pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence has emerged for a stochastic signal correlated among 67 pulsars within the 15-year pulsar-timing data set compiled by the NANOGrav collaboration. Similar signals have been found in data from the European, Indian, Parkes, and Chinese PTAs. This signal has been interpreted as indicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. To explore the internal consistency of this result we investigate how the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one from the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the (noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to measure correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the radio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that were initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can only be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After conducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything inconsistent with the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the NANOGrav 15-year data. The methodologies developed here can offer additional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets. While this analysis provides an internal consistency check of the NANOGrav results, it does not eliminate the necessity for additional investigations that could identify potential systematics or uncover unmodeled physical phenomena in the data.</description>

      <title>Rapid eccentric spin-aligned binary black hole waveform generation based on deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate waveform templates of binary black holes (BBHs) with eccentric orbits are essential for the detection and precise parameter estimation of gravitational waves (GWs). While SEOBNRE produces accurate time-domain waveforms for eccentric BBH systems, its generation speed remains a critical bottleneck in analyzing such systems. Accelerating template generation is crucial to data analysis improvement and valuable information extraction from observational data. We present SEOBNRE_AIq5e2, an innovative AI-based surrogate model that crafted to accelerate waveform generation for eccentric, spin-aligned BBH systems. SEOBNRE_AIq5e2 incorporates an advanced adaptive resampling technique during training, enabling the generation of eccentric BBH waveforms with mass ratios up to 5, eccentricities below 0.2, and spins $|\chi_z|$ up to 0.6. It achieves an impressive generation speed of 4.3 ms per waveform with a mean mismatch of $1.02 \times 10^{-3}$. With the exceptional accuracy and rapid performance, SEOBNRE_AIq5e2 emerges as a promising waveform template for future analysis of eccentric gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis for Remote Biosignature Identification on exoEarths (BARBIE) \RNum{3}: Introducing the KEN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deploy a newly-generated set of geometric albedo spectral grids to examine the detectability of methane (CH4) in the reflected-light spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet at visible and near-infrared wavelengths with a future exoplanet imaging mission. By quantifying the detectability as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and molecular abundance, we can constrain the best methods of detection with the high-contrast space-based coronagraphy slated for the next generation telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We used 25 bandpasses between 0.8 and 1.5 microns. The abundances range from a modern-Earth level to an Archean-Earth level, driven by abundances found in available literature. We constrain the optimal 20%, 30%, and 40% bandpasses based on the effective SNR of the data, and investigate the impact of spectral confusion between CH4 and H2O on the detectability of each one. We find that a modern-Earth level of CH4 is not detectable, while an Archean Earth level of CH4 would be detectable at all SNRs and bandpass widths. Crucially, we find that CH4 detectability is inversely correlated with H2o abundance, with required SNR increasing as H2O abundance increases, while H2O detectability depends on CH4 abundance and selected observational wavelength, implying that science requirements for the characterization of Earth-like planet atmospheres in the VIS/NIR should consider the abundances of both species in tandem.</description>

      <title>The BlackGEM telescope array I: Overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main science aim of the BlackGEM array is to detect optical counterparts to gravitational wave mergers. Additionally, the array will perform a set of synoptic surveys to detect Local Universe transients and short time-scale variability in stars and binaries, as well as a six-filter all-sky survey down to ~22nd mag. The BlackGEM Phase-I array consists of three optical wide-field unit telescopes. Each unit uses an f/5.5 modified Dall-Kirkham (Harmer-Wynne) design with a triplet corrector lens, and a 65cm primary mirror, coupled with a 110Mpix CCD detector, that provides an instantaneous field-of-view of 2.7~square degrees, sampled at 0.564\arcsec/pixel. The total field-of-view for the array is 8.2 square degrees. Each telescope is equipped with a six-slot filter wheel containing an optimised Sloan set (BG-u, BG-g, BG-r, BG-i, BG-z) and a wider-band 440-720 nm (BG-q) filter. Each unit telescope is independent from the others. Cloud-based data processing is done in real time, and includes a transient-detection routine as well as a full-source optimal-photometry module. BlackGEM has been installed at the ESO La Silla observatory as of October 2019. After a prolonged COVID-19 hiatus, science operations started on April 1, 2023 and will run for five years. Aside from its core scientific program, BlackGEM will give rise to a multitude of additional science cases in multi-colour time-domain astronomy, to the benefit of a variety of topics in astrophysics, such as infant supernovae, luminous red novae, asteroseismology of post-main-sequence objects, (ultracompact) binary stars, and the relation between gravitational wave counterparts and other classes of transients</description>

      <title>Cascade adaptive optics with a second stage based on a Zernike wavefront sensor for exoplanet observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the high-contrast observation of disks and gas giant planets around nearby stars has been made possible on ground-based instruments using extreme adaptive optics (XAO). While these facilities produce images with a Strehl ratio larger than 90% in H-band in median observing conditions and high-flux regime, the correction leaves AO residuals which impede the study of fainter or less massive exoplanets. Cascade AO systems with a fast second stage based on a Pyramid wavefront sensor have recently emerged as an appealing solution to reduce the atmospheric wavefront errors. Since these aberrations are expected to be small, they can also be accurately measured by a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), a well-known concept for its high sensitivity and moderate linear capture range. We propose an alternative second stage that relies on the ZWFS to correct for the AO residuals. We implemented the cascade AO with a ZWFS-based control loop on the ESO's GHOST testbed to validate the scheme in monochromatic light. In median wind speed and seeing, our second-stage AO with a ZWFS and a basic integrator reduce the atmospheric residuals by a factor of 6 and increase the wavefront error stability with a gain of 2 from open to closed loop. In the presence of non common path aberrations, we also reach a contrast gain by a factor of 2 in the images with a Lyot coronagraph at short separations from the source, proving the ability of our scheme to work in cascade with an XAO loop. In addition, it may prove useful for imaging fainter or lighter close-in companions. In more challenging conditions, contrast improvements are also achieved by adjusting the control loop features. Our study validates the ZWFS-based second-stage AO loop as an effective solution to address small residuals left from a single-stage XAO system for the coronagraphic observations of circumstellar environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope marks a significant step forward in radio astronomy, presenting new opportunities and challenges for data analysis. Traditional visual models pretrained on optical photography images may not perform optimally on radio interferometry images, which have distinct visual characteristics.
  Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising approach to address this issue, leveraging the abundant unlabeled data in radio astronomy to train neural networks that learn useful representations from radio images. This study explores the application of SSL to radio astronomy, comparing the performance of SSL-trained models with that of traditional models pretrained on natural images, evaluating the importance of data curation for SSL, and assessing the potential benefits of self-supervision to different domain-specific radio astronomy datasets.
  Our results indicate that, SSL-trained models achieve significant improvements over the baseline in several downstream tasks, especially in the linear evaluation setting; when the entire backbone is fine-tuned, the benefits of SSL are less evident but still outperform pretraining. These findings suggest that SSL can play a valuable role in efficiently enhancing the analysis of radio astronomical data.

      <title>Post-processing subtraction of tilt-to-length noise in LISA in the presence of gravitational wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory. It will measure gravitational wave signals in the frequency regime from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. The success of these measurements will depend on the suppression of the various instrument noises. One important noise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. Here, it is understood as the coupling of angular jitter, predominantly from the spacecraft, into the interferometric length readout. The current plan is to subtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise minimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the GW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly modeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will not degrade the GW signals. In the present manuscript, we show on simulated LISA data and for four different GW signal types that the GW responses have little effect on the quality of the TTL coupling fit and subtraction. Also, the GW signal characteristics were not altered by the TTL coupling subtraction.</description>

      <title>Inferring Interference: Identifying a Perturbing Tertiary with Eccentric Gravitational Wave Burst Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07278v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] Binary black holes may form and merge dynamically. These binaries are likely to become bound with high eccentricities, resulting in a burst of gravitational radiation at their point of closest approach. When such a binary is perturbed by a third body, the evolution of the orbit is affected, and gravitational-wave burst times are altered. The bursts times therefore encode information about the tertiary. In order to extract this information, we require a prescription for the relationship between the tertiary properties and the gravitational-wave burst times. In this paper, we demonstrate a toy model for the burst times of a secular three-body system. We show how Bayesian inference can be employed to deduce the tertiary properties when the bursts are detected by next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We study the bursts from an eccentric binary with a total mass of $60$~M$_\odot$ orbiting an $6 \times 10^{8}$~M$_\odot$ supermassive black hole. When we assume no knowledge of the eccentric binary, we are unable to tightly constrain the existence or properties of the tertiary, and we recover biased posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the eccentric binary. However, when the properties of the binary are already well-known -- as is likely if the late inspiral and merger are also detected -- we are able to more accurately infer the mass of the perturber, $m_3$, and its distance from the binary, $R$. When we assume measurement precision on the binary parameters consistent with expectations for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, we can be greater than $90\%$ confident that the binary is perturbed.

Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB), a remnant of the Big Bang, provides unparalleled insights into the primordial universe, its energy content, and the origin of cosmic structures. The success of forthcoming terrestrial and space experiments hinges on meticulously calibrated data. Specifically, the ability to achieve an absolute calibration of the polarization angles with a precision of &lt; 0.1 deg is crucial to identify the signatures of primordial gravitational waves and cosmic birefringence within the CMB polarization. We introduce the COSMOCal project, designed to deploy a polarized source in space for calibrating microwave frequency observations. The project aims to integrate microwave polarization observations from small and large telescopes, ground-based and in space, into a unified scale, enhancing the effectiveness of each observatory and allowing robust combination of data. To demonstrate the feasibility and confirm the observational approach of our project, we developed a prototype instrument that operates in the atmospheric window centered at 260 GHz, specifically tailored for use with the NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We present the instrument components and their laboratory characterization. The results of tests performed with the fully assembled prototype using a KIDs-based instrument, similar concept of NIKA2, are also reported. This study paves the way for an observing campaign using the IRAM 30m telescope and contributes to the development of a space-based instrument.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>

Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests, including preserving the asymptotic diffusion limit. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>

Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>
