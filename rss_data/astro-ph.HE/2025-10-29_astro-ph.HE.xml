      <title>Shock Acceleration in the Intracluster Medium: Implications of Micromirror Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging galaxy clusters exhibit strong observational evidence for efficient particle acceleration in the intracluster medium (ICM), particularly in the form of synchrotron-emitting radio relics and halos. Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large diffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively unmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy ($E_{\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand, recent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be suppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating plasma-scale magnetic structures, or "micromirrors," that efficiently scatter CRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement for shock acceleration in the ICM. We demonstrate that micromirrors enforce a minimum value of $E_{\rm max} \gtrsim 100$ GeV that does not rely on CR-driven magnetic field amplification. We also discuss micromirror confinement in the context of cosmological simulations and $\gamma$-ray observations, and present a simulation of a Coma-like merging cluster that self-consistently includes CR acceleration at shocks, with an effective diffusion coefficient set by micromirrors. We show that the introduction of micromirrors yields simulated galaxy clusters that remain consistent with $\gamma$-ray observations.</description>

      <title>AT2025ulz and S250818k: Leveraging DESI spectroscopy in the hunt for a kilonova associated with a sub-solar mass gravitational wave candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On August 18th, 2025, the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaboration reported a sub-threshold gravitational wave candidate detection consistent with a sub-solar-mass neutron star merger, denoted S250818k. An optical transient, AT2025ulz, was discovered within the localization region. AT2025ulz initially appeared to meet the expected behavior of kilonova (KN) emission, the telltale signature of a binary neutron star merger. The transient subsequently rebrightened after $\sim$\,$5$ days and developed spectral features characteristic of a Type IIb supernova. In this work, we analyze the observations of the host galaxy of AT2025ulz obtained by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). From the DESI spectrum, we obtain a secure redshift of $z = 0.084840 \pm 0.000006$, which places the transient within $2\sigma$ of the gravitational wave distance and results in an integral overlap between the gravitational wave alert and the transient location of $\log_{10}\mathcal{I} \approx 3.9-4.2$. Our analysis of the host galaxy's spectral energy distribution reveals a star-forming, dusty galaxy with stellar mass ${\sim} 10^{10}~M_\odot$, broadly consistent with the population of both short gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernova host galaxies. We also present our follow-up of DESI-selected candidate host galaxies using the Fraunhofer Telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory, and show the promise of DESI for associating or rejecting candidate electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave alerts. These results emphasize the value of DESI's extensive spectroscopic dataset in rapidly characterizing host galaxies, enabling spectroscopic host subtraction, and guiding targeted follow-up.</description>

      <title>Continuous gravitational waves from magnetized white dwarfs: Quantifying the detection plausibility by LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) are frequently observed to have strong magnetic fields up to $10^9$ G and expected to have a possible internal field as high as $\sim 10^{14}$ G. High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium structure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned with the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from magnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO, Deci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute the resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum loss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale for detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while the object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could detect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its mission. As a specific case, we investigate ZTF J1901+1458- a compact, massive, fast-rotating, and strongly magnetized WD with spin period $\sim416$ s and inferred surface field $\sim10^{9}$ G. We find that this object would be detectable by LISA with four years of continuous data. This highlights the potential of CGW observations to probe magnetic field structure in WDs and their role in type Ia supernova progenitors.</description>

      <title>AT2025ulz and S250818k: Deep X-ray and radio limits on off-axis afterglow emission and prospects for future discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23728v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first joint electromagentic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) detection, known as GW170817, marked a critical juncture in our collective understanding of compact object mergers. However, it has now been 8 years since this discovery, and the search for a second EM-GW detection has yielded no robust discoveries. Recently, on August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported a low-significance (high false alarm rate) binary neutron star merger candidate S250818k. Rapid optical follow-up revealed a single optical candidate AT2025ulz ($z=0.08484$) that initially appeared consistent with kilonova emission. We quickly initiated a set of observations with \textit{Swift}, \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Chandra}, and the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal afterglow emission. Our deep X-ray and radio search rules out that the optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz is related to the afterglow onset, reinforcing its classification as a stripped-envelope supernova (SN 2025ulz). We derive constraints on the afterglow parameters for a hypothetical binary neutron star merger at the distance of AT2025ulz ($\approx 400$ Mpc) based on our X-ray and radio limits. We conclude that our observational campaign could exclude a GW170817-like afterglow out to viewing angles of $\theta_\textrm{v}\approx 12.5$ degrees. We briefly discuss the prospects for the future discovery of off-axis afterglows.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Simulations of Tidal Disruption Encores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.</description>

      <title>ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz) and S250818k: A Candidate Superkilonova from a Sub-threshold Sub-Solar Gravitational Wave Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the radio-gamma spectrum of the pulsar wind nebula around PSR J1124-5916 in SNR G292.0+1.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially associated with the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) hosted by the young core-collapse supernova remnant G292.0+1.8, based on a detailed time-resolved analysis of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. By isolating the unpulsed component from the dominant magnetospheric radiation of PSR~J1124$-$5916, we successfully disentangle a candidate nebular emission in the GeV range, characterise its morphology and extract its spectrum. This identification places G292.0+1.8 among the few systems in which the pulsar and PWN contributions have been spectrally resolved at high energies, offering new insight into their respective emission mechanisms. We characterise the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the pulsar and model the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the PWN using radio, X-ray, and GeV data. The emission is well described by a single electron population with two spectral breaks: one intrinsic to the injection spectrum and another produced by synchrotron cooling in a magnetic field of $\sim$15~$\mu$G. Notably, the inferred magnetic field and the low TeV flux of the nebula resemble those of 3C~58, suggesting that similar low-field environments can arise in young PWNe. The high-energy portion of the SED is now tightly constrained by our GeV detection and existing TeV upper limits. Compared to our model, earlier predictions tend to underpredict the $\gamma$-ray flux, while others that succeed in reproducing the GeV component often overpredict the TeV emission. This mismatch underscores the challenges in modelling particle acceleration and radiation processes in young PWNe and establishes G292.0+1.8 as a valuable benchmark for testing and refining such models.</description>

      <title>Study of Neutron Star Properties under the Two-Flavor Quark NJL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Equation of State (EOS) of matter within neutron stars is a central topic in nuclear physics and astrophysics. A precise understanding of the composition and phase behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is crucial for uncovering the fundamental laws of the strong interaction. This study investigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. As an effective theory, this model can describe the generation of dynamical quark masses and chiral symmetry restoration characteristic of dense quark matter.
  We construct the hybrid EOS by joining the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model for hadronic matter with the NJL model for quark matter. A quintic polynomial interpolation ensures a smooth ($C^2$ continuity) and thermodynamically consistent crossover between the phases. Based on this hybrid EOS, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to calculate macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and the tidal deformability parameter ($\Lambda$).
  By exploring key model parameters, we identify a region satisfying a wide range of multi-messenger constraints. Our resulting EOS supports a maximum mass consistent with PSR J0740+6620, while simultaneously predicting radii and tidal deformabilities for a $1.4M_{\odot}$ star that agree with NICER observations and limits from GW170817. This work thus presents a self-consistent model that resolves the tension between high-mass pulsars and small tidal deformabilities, deepening our understanding of the hadron-quark crossover.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the soft X-ray source population towards the inner Galactic disk with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across the Galactic disk lies a diverse population of X-ray sources, with the fainter end remaining poorly understood due to past survey sensitivity limits. We aim to classify and characterize faint X-ray sources detected in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) towards the inner Galactic disk ($350^\circ &lt; l &lt; 360^\circ$, $-1^\circ &lt; b &lt; 1^\circ$) using deeper XMM-Newton observations (typical exposure of $\sim 20\,\text{ks}$). We analyzed 189 eRASS1 sources, combining X-ray spectral fitting ($0.2$--$10\,\text{keV}$) with Gaia astrometric and photometric data for robust classification. Our results show that the eRASS1 catalog towards the Galactic disk is overwhelmingly dominated by coronal sources ($\sim 74\%$), primarily active stars and binaries, with $\sim 8\%$ being wind-powered massive stars and $\sim 18\%$ being accreting compact objects. We propose an empirical hardness-ratio cut ($\text{HR} &gt; -0.2$) to efficiently isolate these non-coronal sources. By stacking the classified population and comparing with the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE), we estimate that $\sim 6\%$ of the GRXE flux in the $0.5$--$2.0\,\text{keV}$ band is resolved into point sources above the eRASS1 flux limit ($\sim 5\times 10^{-14}\,\text{erg}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$). This resolved soft-band emission is dominated by active stars, while hard-band flux originates primarily from X-ray binaries. We conclude that the eRASS1 catalog retains a non-negligible population of compact objects that can be effectively distinguished using X-ray color selection.</description>

      <title>Testing common approximations of neutrino fast flavor conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23917v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new chapter is opening in the theory of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers as simulations of these events begin to incorporate fast flavor conversion (FFC) and other forms of neutrino flavor mixing. Using numerical experiments, we show that the approximations of FFC that have been implemented so far are limited by at least two of three factors: (1) approximating continuous evolution as a discrete sequence of instabilities, (2) using spatially homogeneous asymptotic states, and (3) assuming that FFC must be accompanied by instability. The factors we identify in this work will be important considerations as the research area progresses from initial exploratory studies to more quantitatively precise assessments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Gamma Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole) as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.</description>

      <title>Rest-frame Optical Spectroscopy of $z \sim 2$ Quasars with Steep Hard X-ray Spectral Shapes: X-ray Selection of Super-Eddington Accretion and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23979</link>

Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase in the growth of supermassive black holes. However, identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars observationally is challenging due to uncertain black-hole mass estimates and other complications. The Eddington ratio parameter does not represent accurately the accretion rate in the super-Eddington regime. On the other hand, super-Eddington accreting quasars appear to show large hard X-ray (rest-frame &gt; 2 keV) power-law photon indices, and they also exhibit distinct optical spectral features including weak [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission and strong Fe II emission. We test steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars by obtaining Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope near-infrared spectra for a pilot sample of nine $\Gamma=2.0-2.6$ quasars at $z\approx1.4-2.5$. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole masses (median value $\rm 4.3 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios (median value 0.6). The Eddington ratio distribution is consistent with that of the comparison sample, which is a flux-limited sample of quasars at $z\approx1.5-3.5$ with near-infrared spectroscopy. But our super-Eddington candidates do show statistically weaker [O III] emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.0075$) and marginally stronger Fe II emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.06$). We also find one candidate with broad (width of 1960 km/s) and blueshifted (690 km/s) [O III] $\lambda 4959$ and [O III] $\lambda 5007$ lines, which probably originate from a strong [O III] outflow driven by super-Eddington accretion. Overall, the steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars appears promising. But a larger sample is needed to assess further the reliability of the selection.</description>

      <title>Diverse Emission Patterns from Precessing Super-Eddington Disks Formed in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the orbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the SMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk precessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this paper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such TDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous super-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the disk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray radiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer and the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1) The smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The dimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to moderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions take turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the X-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other twice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one cycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray and optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for interpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics and gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of J045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously.</description>

      <title>Eclipsed X-ray Bursts from Magnetar SGR J1935+2154 and the Fireball Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray bursts from the magnetar can lead to the formation of fireballs trapped by the magnetic field and co-rotating with the star. The fireball emission could occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we discover a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Based on these bursts, we identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\circ \pm 10^\circ$. The distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than five times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. We also find this configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature in their spectra. Our results suggest that some intermediate X-ray bursts of SGR 1935+2154 may originate from magnetic reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.</description>

      <title>Decadal brightening in the northeastern non-thermal filament of Cassiopeia A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the decadal brightening of non-thermal emission flux in the northeastern filament of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), which highlights dynamic processes in the forward shock. This filament, characterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A's outer shells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying astrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by several tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has remained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament's morphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections. Detailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux increase followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These differences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic interactions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with surrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young supernova remnants. The localized evolution of this filament, captured with high spatial resolution, provides critical insights into the temporal dynamics of non-thermal particles and the generation of cosmic rays from asymmetric supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Vortex Creep Heating in Neutron Star Cooling: New Insights into Thermal Evolution of Heavy Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide unique laboratories for probing physics of dense nuclear matter under extreme conditions. Their thermal and luminosity evolution reflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field, and so on. Recent observations [\textit{e.g.}, V. Abramkin \textit{et al.,} ApJ \textbf{924}, 128 (2022)] have revealed unexpectedly warm old neutron stars, which cannot be explained by standard neutrino-photon cooling models. The failure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional internal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara \textit{et al}., JCAP \textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep heating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable mechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca (DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined impact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying rotational parameters ($P$, $\dot{P}$, $P_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing gaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay shapes the temperature evolution. Our results show that VCH can substantially mitigate the rapid cooling driven by DUrca, offering new evolutionary pathways for massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>XRISM High-resolution Spectroscopy of SS 433: Evidence of Decreasing Line-of-Sight Velocity Dispersion along the Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the jet structure in SS 433 based on X-ray high resolution spectroscopy with the XRISM/Resolve. The source was observed over 5 days covering both inside and outside an eclipse of the compact object by the companion star. Doppler-shifted, ionized Fe and Ni K emission lines were resolved, as well as lower-energy lines including Si and S K lines. Time-resolved spectral analysis showed that Fe and Ni K line widths were $1020 \pm 40$ km s$^{-1}$ (corresponding the 1$\sigma$ width) in the eclipse phase, gradually increased during the egress, and reached $1740 \pm 30$ km s$^{-1}$ outside the eclipse. A time-averaged spectrum outside the eclipse confirmed that the Fe and Ni K lines in 5.5-9 keV are significantly broader than the Si and S K$\alpha$ emission lines in 2--4 keV. Specifically, the width in 5.5-9 keV was measured to be $1900 \pm 80$ km s$^{-1}$, whereas the width in 2-4 keV is $1300^{+300}_{-400}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the approaching (blueshifted) jet component. These results indicate that radial velocity dispersion of the jet plasma in SS 433 decreases as it moves outward. We interpret this variation as progressive jet collimation along its axis, as suggested by Namiki et al. (2003), or a decrease in turbulence in the jet plasma flow within the X-ray emitting region. We also detected a clear difference in velocity dispersion between the approaching and receding (redshifted) jet components in the 5.5-9 keV band outside eclipse. The receding jet exhibited a smaller velocity dispersion ($1400 \pm 200$ km s$^{-1}$) than the approaching jet. Since the observation was conducted when the approaching jet was tilted toward the observer, this may suggest that the receding jet was more extensively occulted by the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger constraints on transient accelerators of ultra-high energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains an open questions in astrophysics. We explore two primary scenarios for the distribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows either the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly fitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the acceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape. Using these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog of over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited sample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky. A crucial factor in understanding UHECR propagation is the influence of large-scale cosmic structures, particularly galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, which are filled with magnetized diffuse plasma. Intermittent sources hosted in galaxies within such structures, coupled with cosmic magnetic fields, shape the observed UHECR arrival directions and provide insights into the burst rate of the sources. We show that these environments can significantly impact UHECR transport, making them particularly opaque to heavy nuclei. Additionally, we compute the expected secondary neutrino and photon fluxes from UHECR interactions in these environments and compare them with current experimental limits, constraining the maximum energy that particles can achieve. Finally, we assess the compatibility of these constraints with astrophysical candidates, identifying long gamma-ray bursts as the most promising sources.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry with the COMCUBE-S CubeSat Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COMCUBE-S (Compton Telescope CubeSat Swarm) is a proposed mission aimed at understanding the radiation mechanisms of ultra-relativistic jets from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). It consists of a swarm of 16U CubeSats carrying a state-of-the-art Compton polarimeter and a BGO spectrometer to perform timing, spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements of the prompt emission from GRBs. The mission is currently in a feasibility study phase (Phase A) with the European Space Agency to prepare an in-orbit demonstration. Here, we present the simulation work used to optimise the design and operational concept of the microsatellite constellation, as well as estimate the mission performance in terms of GRB detection rate and polarimetry. We used the MEGAlib software to simulate the response function of the gamma-ray instruments, together with a detailed model for the background particle and radiation fluxes in low-Earth orbit. We also developed a synthetic GRB population model to best estimate the detection rate. These simulations show that COMCUBE-S will detect about 2 GRBs per day, which is significantly higher than that of all past and current GRB missions. Furthermore, simulated performance for linear polarisation measurements shows that COMCUBE-S will be able to uniquely distinguish between competing models of the GRB prompt emission, thereby shedding new light on some of the most fundamental aspects of GRB physics.</description>

      <title>XRISM constraints on unidentified X-ray emission lines, including the 3.5 keV line, in the stacked spectrum of ten galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We stack 3.75 Megaseconds of early XRISM Resolve observations of ten galaxy clusters to search for unidentified spectral lines in the $E=$ 2.5-15 keV band (rest frame), including the $E=3.5$ keV line reported in earlier, low spectral resolution studies of cluster samples. Such an emission line may originate from the decay of the sterile neutrino, a warm dark matter (DM) candidate. No unidentified lines are detected in our stacked cluster spectrum, with the $3\sigma$ upper limit on the $m_{\rm s}\sim$ 7.1 keV DM particle decay rate (which corresponds to a $E=3.55$ keV emission line) of $\Gamma \sim 1.0 \times 10^{-27}$ s$^{-1}$. This upper limit is 3-4 times lower than the one derived by Hitomi Collaboration et al. (2017) from the Perseus observation, but still 5 times higher than the XMM-Newton detection reported by Bulbul et al. (2014) in the stacked cluster sample. XRISM Resolve, with its high spectral resolution but a small field of view, may reach the sensitivity needed to test the XMM-Newton cluster sample detection by combining several years worth of future cluster observations.</description>

      <title>AT2025ulz and S250818k: Investigating early time observations of a subsolar mass gravitational-wave binary neutron star merger candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing runs, it has become increasingly clear that identifying the next electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave (GW) neutron star mergers will likely be more challenging compared to the case of GW170817. The rarity of these GW events, and their electromagnetic counterparts, motivates rapid searches of any candidate binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the LVK. We present our extensive photometric and spectroscopic campaign of the candidate counterpart AT2025ulz to the low-significance GW event S250818k, which had a ${\sim} 29\%$ probability of being a BNS merger. We demonstrate that during the first five days, the luminosity and color evolution of AT2025ulz are consistent with both kilonova and shock cooling models, although a Bayesian model comparison shows preference for the shock cooling model, underscoring the ambiguity inherent to early data obtained over only a few days. Continued monitoring beyond this window reveals a rise and color evolution incompatible with kilonova models and instead consistent with a supernova. This event emphasizes the difficulty in identifying the electromagnetic counterparts to BNS mergers and the significant allotment of observing time necessary to robustly differentiate kilonovae from impostors.</description>

      <title>How Flat is a Plateau? Evolution of Late-Time TDE Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late-time light curve plateaus in tidal disruption events (TDEs) are often approximated as flat and time-independent. This simplification is motivated by theoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts slow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected, late-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously accessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the flat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the maximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike information criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors evolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no statistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs that exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated $\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late time TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and the $\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to 0.4 (the mean fitted $\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly consistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we estimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models. Theoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude shorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\rm prec}\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\alpha$ parameters, we estimate that late time disks may experience $\sim$few-10 precession cycles.</description>

      <title>Glimpsing Physics of Nano-Hz Gravitational Waves in Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing evidence for nano-hertz gravitational waves, from NANOGrav and other observations, may be pointing to a cosmological first-order phase transition at temperatures of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)\;\mathrm{MeV}$. Such an interpretation requires dynamics beyond the Standard Model in this energy range. If so, it may well be the case that core-collapse supernova explosions would recreate the first-order phase transition leaving a unique imprint on the spectrum of neutrinos emitted in the initial few seconds. This scenario is also suggestive of a low-mass seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino masses. We outline the prospects for future observations of Galactic supernovae to uncover the signals of this scenario, which could get further confirmation with additional pulsar timing array data establishing the primordial origin of the observed nano-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The symplectic geometry of the black hole photon shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unstably bound, critical null geodesics of the Kerr spacetime form a distinguished class of orbits whose properties govern observables such as the photon ring and the high-frequency component of black-hole ringdown. This set of orbits defines a codimension-two submanifold of the null-geodesic phase space known as the photon shell. In this work we investigate the photon shell's intrinsic symplectic geometry. Using the induced symplectic form, we construct the canonical volume form on the shell and compute the differential phase-space volume it encloses as a function of radius -- equivalently, the radial density of states. In the near-extremal limit the photon shell bifurcates into near-horizon and far-region components; we find that approximately $3\%$ of the shell's phase-space volume resides in the near-horizon component. We also analyze a thickening of the photon shell that includes near-critical orbits, and compute its differential phase-space volume. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, these results may inform the interpretation of high-resolution observations of spinning black holes.</description>

      <title>WIMP Shadows: Phenomenology of Secluded Dark Matter in Three Minimal BSM Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of secluded dark matter (DM) $\chi$, where the relic abundance is set by annihilations into lighter dark mediators $\phi$ that couple only feebly to the Standard Model (SM). In contrast to canonical WIMPs, which are now strongly constrained by direct and indirect searches, secluded models still achieve the observed relic abundance via thermal freeze-out into hidden-sector mediators, while predicting highly suppressed present-day signals. We analyze three minimal models: (i) a $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($A'$) with kinetic mixing; (ii) a scalar DM candidate $S$ with a scalar mediator $K$ that has a trilinear vertex; and (iii) a Dirac fermion $\chi$ whose mass arises from a Higgs-mixed singlet $H_p$. For each model we derive annihilation and scattering rates in both WIMP-like and secluded regimes, and solve the Boltzmann equations: a single-species equation for the WIMP case and a coupled $\chi$-$\phi$ system for the secluded case to account for possible early departure of the mediator from thermal equilibrium with the SM bath. In this regard, we provide explicit lower limits on the portal coupling $\epsilon$ required to keep the mediator in thermal equilibrium with the SM bath and to ensure mediator decay before BBN. We show that for portal couplings $\epsilon \ll 10^{-3}$ the relic density is dominantly controlled by DM annihilation into mediator pairs, while spin-independent scattering lies well below current limits and remains viable even for future experiments approaching the irreducible neutrino background floor. Indirect constraints are typically weak due to $p$-wave suppression, off-resonance $s$-channels, and cascade spectra controlled by $\epsilon^2$. Finally, we highlight the most promising collider tests, which remain sensitive despite tiny portal couplings.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory-agnostic framework to search for extra-fundamental modes in the ringdown phase of black hole mergers. These modes, distinct from standard General Relativity (GR) deviations, originate from modifications of the theory of gravity. Applying our method to the events GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find no significant evidence for extra modes beyond those expected in GR.</description>

      <title>Constraining the gravitational-wave emission of core-collapse supernovae with ground-based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A gravitational-wave background (GWB) arising from the superposition of numerous unresolved gravitational-wave signals has yet to be detected. Potential contributing sources to such a background include compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In this work, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave energy emitted by CCSNe using cross-correlation measurements made with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors during their third observing run (O3). Specifically, we obtain a $95\%$ credibility upper limit of $0.01~ {M_\odot c^2}$ while accounting for the contribution from CBC sources to a GWB. This result improves on previous constraint obtained from initial LIGO data by approximately two orders of magnitude. We also explore the detection prospects of third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer for both individual CCSNe events and the GWB. Our results show that single events are likely to be detected prior to the GWB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available for the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the number density of pairs, the average energy per pair, and their energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Energy of 2+1-flavor dense quark matter from perturbative QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion was developed to connect isospin symmetric matter probed in nuclear experiments to asymmetric matter found in neutron stars. Using the isospin asymmetry derived from the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula, we derive the symmetry energy expansion for quark matter that has unique properties compared to hadronic matter. To test our methods, we use perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading-order, where realistic quark masses can be included. We find that pQCD at electroweak equilibrium is not isospin symmetric but rather obtains a small skewness term in the symmetry energy expansion. We predict that if equations of state for nuclear matter must match pQCD results, then a non-monotonic dip in the symmetry energy would appear.</description>

      <title>Radiatively-Cooled Mass Transfer: Disk Properties and L2 outflows across Mass Transfer Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High rates of stable mass transfer (MT) occur for some binary star systems, resulting in luminous transients and circumbinary outflows. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a $10 \ M_\odot$ donor star and a $5\ M_\odot$ point mass secondary, incorporating approximate effects of radiative cooling. By varying the orbital separation of the system, we probe MT rates between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1} M_\odot$/yr. Mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring for MT rates $\gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr, while the MT remaining mostly conservative for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity $L$ and temperature increases with MT rate, with $L \sim 10^{5} L_\odot$ and $T \sim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$ for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the accretion disk and circumbinary outflow. The most luminous transients associated with mass outflows will be rare due to the high MT rate requirement, but generate significant optical emission from both the accretor's disk and the circumbinary outflow.</description>

      <title>Probing the nonstrange quark star equation of state with compact stars and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event, cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Cosmic Ray Transport on the $\gamma$-Ray Luminosity of Diffuse Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of $\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to study the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical environments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium (ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal particles and produce $\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser gas, they produce more $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different cosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a turbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two quantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the correlation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must escape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\gamma$-ray emission and be consistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms (either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower $\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of magnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps) is necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of $\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the significant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray reacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent reacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds drive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In axion models, interactions between axions and electromagnetic waves induce frequency-dependent time delays determined by the axion mass and decay constant. These small delays are difficult to detect, limiting the effectiveness of traditional methods. We compute such delays under realistic radio telescope conditions and identify a prominent dispersive feature near half the axion mass, which appears non-divergent within the limits of observational resolution. Based on this, we develop a machine learning method that achieves 90\% classification accuracy and demonstrates well performance in low signal-to-noise regimes. The method's robustness is confirmed against false positives using both simulated noisy data and real-world, known-null observations. Future improvements in optical clock precision and telescope bandwidth, particularly with instruments such as the Qitai Radio Telescope, may enhance constraints on the axion decay constant by up to four orders of magnitude in the $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV mass range.</description>

      <title>The variability of active galaxies: I. Broad-band noise X-ray power spectra from XMM-Newton and Swift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies are the engine of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the `X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56 variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the $0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H 1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog~(GWTC-4) has enabled empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the binary black hole~(BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction~($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors. We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be $(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>The impact of the eccentricity on the collapse of an ellipsoid into a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid. We have shown that the minimal size $r$ that the ellipsoid can reach during collapse depends on its initial eccentricity $e_0$ as $r\propto e_0^\nu$, where $\nu \approx 15/8$, and this dependence is very universal. We have estimated the parameters (in particular, the initial eccentricity) of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid, whereat it collapses directly into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of long-duration gravitational wave signals originating from Galactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of quasi-monochromatic, long-duration (continuous) gravitational wave radiation emitted by, e.g., asymmetric rotating neutron stars in our Galaxy requires a long observation time to distinguish it from the detector's noise. If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational effect of microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals for Galactic sources and lenses in the point mass lens approximation. In particular, we examine the regions of the parameter space that are promising for lensed CW searches, and perform example simulations to demonstrate how the lensing effect affects the continuous-wave signal. We show that an analytical lensing pattern can be identified from the lensed continuous wave signal using the Time-Domain F-statistic search, as the estimated signal-to-noise ratio in each time-domain segment scales directly with the amplification factor.</description>

      <title>Learning about neutron star composition from the slope of the mass-radius diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The slope of the neutron star mass-radius curve, $dM/dR$, is studied to understand the information it may carry about the composition of neutron stars, particularly with regard to the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom. This study uses two large sets of relativistic mean-field equations of state with either nucleonic or nucleonic and hyperonic degrees of freedom, and imposes constraints obtained from GW170817 and the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. It is shown that: i) some mass-radius curves are characterized by a negative slope from one solar mass up to the maximum mass; ii) other equations of state (EoS) have a positive slope for a given range of masses below the maximum star mass. Within the set of models considered, the first set includes only a very small number of hyperonic EoS: less than 0.5\% of the total number of hyperonic stars and approximately one third of the nucleonic EoS. We have also analyzed the sign of the slope for neutron star masses of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.8$M_\odot$. Only approximately 1\% of hyperonic equations of state (EoS) predict a negative slope for 1.4$M_\odot$ stars, whereas over 90\% of nucleonic stars have a negative slope at this mass. Finally, almost all stars have a negative slope at 1.8$M_\odot$. A positive slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ may indicate the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom within neutron stars. The nuclear matter property that distinguishes the different scenarios most clearly is the curvature of the symmetry energy. Nucleonic EoSs with a positive slope $dM/dR$ predict the highest values, which can exceed 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Shower formation in the presence of a string-inspired foam in space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that predictions of Lorentz-breaking space-time foam models from string theory may be compatible with the suggestion of light-speed variation from gamma-ray burst studies. Our analysis of foam-modified kinematics shows that despite the subluminal photon velocities explaining photon time delays one may, and in certain circumstances does, keep intact the electromagnetic showers essential for the detection and identification of cosmic photons. In contrast to other~(mostly phenomenological) approaches to Lorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the formation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in detectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present string foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes the shower formation constraints from recent observations.</description>

      <title>Shocked, Heated, and Now Resolved: H$_2$ excitation in the low-luminosity AGN at M58 core with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H$_2$ lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to $\nu=2$, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H$_2$ rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution powered by AGN X-ray photons in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner $\sim$200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>BREAKFAST: A Framework for general joint BA duty and follow-up guidance of multiple $\gamma$-ray monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates (BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current requirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty, named "BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and Summary Tools" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated, semi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST also aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes through rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge between prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on prompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the future.</description>

      <title>On the observation of cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>
