      <title>Nonradial stability of topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological stars are regular, horizonless solitons arising from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. They also provide a compelling realization of ultracompact objects arising from a well-defined theory and display all the phenomenological features typically associated with black hole mimickers, including a (stable) photon sphere, long-lived quasinormal modes, and echoes in the ringdown. By completing a thorough linear stability analysis, we provide strong numerical evidence that these solutions are stable against nonradial perturbations with zero Kaluza-Klein momentum.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between Myrzakulov $F(R,Q)$ gravity and Tsallis cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between Myrzakulov $F(R,Q)$ gravity and Tsallis cosmology. The former is a modified gravity that uses both curvature and nonmetricity, while the latter is a modified cosmology arising from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, employing Tsallis entropy instead of the Bekenstein-Hawking one. By appropriately identifying the functional dependencies and the model parameters, we demonstrate that both frameworks can give identical background evolution, reproducing the standard cosmological sequence of matter and dark energy domination. However, their perturbation behavior exhibits differences, since the growth of density fluctuations and the effective Newton constant deviate between the two scenarios, indicating that perturbative observables, such as structure formation and weak-lensing ones, could serve as distinguishing factors between them.</description>

      <title>Choosing suitable noise models for nanohertz gravitational-wave astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the parameters of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background is essential for understanding its origin. The background is typically modeled with a power-law spectrum, parametrized with an amplitude $A$, which describes its intensity, and a spectral index $\gamma$, which describes how the background varies with frequency. Different collaborations have produced varied estimates of $\gamma$, some in tension with the value of $\gamma = 13/3$ expected for circular, gravitational-wave-driven binary black holes. However, estimates of $A$ and $\gamma$ can be affected by systematic errors and misspecified noise models. We investigate how systematic errors, which may plausibly be present in pulsar-timing analyses, can shift inferences about $A, \gamma$. We demonstrate that conservatively incorporating noise sources into the model that are not actually present in the data does not produce bias inferences in practice. This addresses concerns that an overly complex noise model might lead to bias from a needlessly conservative prior. Our results highlight the importance of using comprehensive noise models in pulsar timing analyses to ensure accurate and reliable parameter estimation of the gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity with future ground- and space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future ground- and space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to test general relativity (GR) with greater precision. In this work, we investigate the capability of future ground-based GW detectors, the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE), and space-based GW detectors, LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, for constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity. We inject several typical GW signals from compact binary systems into GW detectors and perform Bayesian inferences with the modified waveforms with parity and Lorentz-violating effects. These effects are modeled in the amplitude and phase corrections to the GW waveforms with their frequency-dependence described by factors $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$. Our results show that the combined observations of ET and CE will impose significantly tighter bounds on the energy scale of parity and Lorentz violations ($M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$) compared to those given by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors. For cases with positive values of $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$, the constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$ from ground-based detectors are tighter than those from the space-based detectors. For the $\beta_{\mu} = -1$ case, space-based GW detectors provide constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ that are better than current LVK observations and comparable to those from ET and CE. Additionally, space-based detectors exhibit superior sensitivity in constraining $M_{\rm LV}$ for $\beta_{\bar \mu} = -2$ case, which is approximately three orders of magnitude tighter than those from ground-based GW detectors. This scenario also enables bounds on the graviton mass at $m_g \lesssim 10^{-35}\; {\rm GeV}$. These findings highlight the promising role of future GW observatories in probing fundamental physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Dynamical Evolution of Scalar Fields in the Einstein-Bumblebee Theory with a Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of static, spherically symmetric black holes within the Einstein-Bumblebee gravity model with a cosmological constant, focusing on scalar field perturbations. Through separation of the angular components, the scalar field perturbations outside the black hole are reduced to a purely radial main equation. The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the system are then determined via the WKB approximation in the frequency domain, while the dynamic evolution of the system is examined in the time domain using finite difference methods. The eigenfrequencies of the waveforms from the time-domain evolution are fitted to cross-validate the frequency-domain results. The study finds that the Lorentz violation parameter $ \ell $ and the cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ significantly influence the QNMs. Specifically, as $ \ell $ increases, the real and imaginary components of the lower modes decrease, while in higher modes, the real part changes minimally, and the imaginary part decreases rapidly. An increase in $ \Lambda $ similarly results in a decrease in the overall QNM values. These results are supported by the time-domain analysis, providing a clearer picture of how Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the QNMs of de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Polymer cosmology with polymer matter: Effective dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effective dynamics of a polymer quantized scalar field living on an effective polymer quantized homogeneous and isotropic background. We use a presureless dust field as an internal clock, and work with volume variables. Our results show how the quantum bounce in the early universe is affected as the initial conditions and various physical parameters -- including the scalar field polymer scale -- are varied. We also find, generically, that there is asymmetric evolution across the bounce.</description>

      <title>Black Strings and String Clouds Embedded in Anisotropic Quintessence: Solutions for Scalar Particles and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spacetime metric associated with a black string surrounded by a cloud of strings and an anisotropic fluid of quintessence in cylindrically symmetric AdS spacetime. We solve Einstein's equation to obtain the explicit form of the metric, investigate typical values for its parameters, and determine their role in the event horizon formation. Within our findings, we show that the intensity of the cloud of strings regulates the size of the event horizon and, when the cloud is absent, the horizon increases drastically for larger values of the quintessence's state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$. Additionally, the metric shows that, unless $\alpha_{Q}$ is close to its lower bound, the contribution from the quintessence fluid is only significant at large distances from the black string. Finally, to explore the quantum implications of this dark energy candidate, we use the confluent Heun function to solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a spin-0 particle near the event horizon. Our results indicate that the presence of quintessence alters the particle's radial wave function. This modification, in principle, could give rise to an observable that we termed as \enquote{dark phase}.</description>

      <title>Exploring generalized Starobinsky Model of Inflation: Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the power-law Starobinsky model, a generalized version of the Starobinsky inflation model, characterized by a power-law correction to Einstein gravity. Employing the $f(R)$ formalism, the scalar and tensor power spectra were numerically computed as functions of the dimensionless parameters $M$ and $\beta$. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was conducted using Planck-2018, BICEP3 and BAO observational data, yielding precise constraints on $\beta = 1.987^{+0.013}_{-0.016},\, 95\%\, C.\, L.$. and $ \log_{10}M = -4.72^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$. The derived scalar spectral index $n_s=0.9676^{+0.0069}_{-0.0068}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.0074^{+0.0061}_{-0.0044}$ lie within the bounds set by Planck observations. We analyse a general reheating scenario while keeping the number of e-folds during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, fixed. The analysis confirms that deviations from the Starobinsky $R^2$ model are observationaly viable, with implications for high-energy physics and supergravity-based inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes: Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time for Kerr black holes. For For initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Induced Gravitational Waves: the Interplay of Non-Minimal Couplings, Kination and Top Quark Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a minimal scenario where the sole Standard-Model Higgs is responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, produces a significant background of gravitational waves and maintains the full classical stability of the electroweak vacuum. As the Higgs self-coupling runs toward negative values at high energy scales, a non-minimal interaction with curvature during a stiff background expansion era drives the Higgs fluctuations closer to the instability scale. This curvature-induced tachyonic instability leads to an intense production of Higgs particles, accompanied by a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The characteristic features of such signal can be directly correlated to the inflationary scale, the non-minimal coupling parameter and the top quark Yukawa coupling. We distinguish between three possible scenarios: absolute stability with low top quark masses, potential vacuum instability, and absolute stability with new physics above the instability scale. Our findings suggest that the detection of a peaked background of gravitational waves together with its inflationary tail has the potential to unveil the features of the Higgs effective potential at very high energy scales while providing a minimal explanation for the reheating phase and the emergence of the Standard-Model plasma in the early Universe. Unlike other studies in the literature, the generation of gravitational waves in our scenario does not depend on the quantum instability of the Standard Model vacuum.</description>

      <title>Observations of Holographic Quantum-Foam Blurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "foamy" nature of spacetime at the Planck scale was an idea first introduced by John Wheeler in the 1950s. And for the last twenty years or so it has been debated whether those inherent uncertainties in time and path-length might also accumulate in transiting electromagnetic wavefronts, resulting in measurable blurring for images of distant galaxies and quasars. A confusing aspect is that "pointlike" objects will always be blurred out somewhat by the optics of a telescope, especially in the optical. But it turns out that Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are more useful to test this, and have been observed by a host of ground-based and space-based telescopes, including by the Fermi observatory for well over a decade. And a recent one was unprecedented: GRB221009A was extremely bright, allowing follow-up from the infrared through the ultraviolet to X-rays and gamma-rays, including a first association with photons at high TeV energies. I will discuss how that observation is in direct tension with the calculus of how spacetime "foaminess" can add up in an image of a pointsource at cosmological distances, which at high-enough energy could spread these out over the whole sky without resulting in photon loss. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring consistent with holographic quantum gravity is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. This fits with measured instrumental point-spread functions and with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A, resolving the observational issues and pointing to a key physical implication: spacetime does not look smooth.</description>

      <title>Is there a chiral dark dynamo in the universe induced by quantum correction, Nieh-Yan gravity and Barbero-Immirzi field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bombagcino investigated the role of Immirzi parameter when promoted to a field in Einstein-Cartan-Holst black hole and they found that the Immirzi field acts similar to the axion field, as both axial pseudo-vector and vectorial torsion trace appear to be expressed in terms of the 4-gradient of the Immirzi parameter. In this paper we introduced two important ingredients absent in the previous work: the torsion mass, significant for the torsion detection the Large Hadron Collider, and the quantum correction proportional to the 4-divergent of torsion squared. Without the quantum correction, a simple analytical solution is obtained, while the more complicated field equations incorporating the BI field are obtained also analytically. The lower bound of quantum correction parameter is determined in terms of the torsion trace mass squared and axial torsion squared. Our findings reveal that in the late universe, the BI parameter approaches infinity restoring to the Einstein-Cartan theory in the early universe with the dynamical reduction of the Immirzi parameter to a constant BI parameter. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for magnetic dynamos in the early universe, demonstrating that magnetic helicity is proportional to chiral chemical potential. A magnetic field at the QCD phase is found out of $10^{17}$ G, without quantum correction. Furthermore, from this dark magnetogenesis, we estimate light torsion with mass of the order of 1 TeV, An example of unitary preserved Lagrangian with axion as an Immirzi field is obtained. In the present universe we find a magnetic field strength of approximately $10^{-12}$ G which is quite close to the range found by Miniati at the QCD threshold, between $10^{-18}-10^{-15}$ G. Given that unitary violation on theoretical grounds may indicate new physics, exploring unitary violations in dark magnetogenesis could be particularly intriguing.</description>

Abstract: Given any wave operator with principle part $\partial_{t}^2 -\partial_{x}^2 +\mathcal{B}^{xx}(\omega t,x)\partial_{x}^2$, where $\mathcal{B}^{xx}:\mathbb{T}^{\nu+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a sufficiently small, quasi-periodic perturbation and $\omega \in \mathbb{R}^\nu$, we explain how to construct \emph{null coordinates} that respect the quasi-periodicity of the solutions. As it turns out, in these coordinates, the principal symbol of the wave operator above has constant coefficients. To construct these coordinates, we start by writing the wave operator in geometric form, modulo terms of order $1$, meaning as the wave operator arising from an $(1+1)$-Lorentzian metric and then define null coordinates as solutions to the Eikonal equations, so that the metric is conformally flat in these coordinates. The problem of constructing these coordinates is then eventually reduced to that of straightening a vector field with quasi-periodic coefficients. As an application, we give a novel proof of a recent reducibility result of Berti-Feola-Procesi-Terracina for the quasi-periodically forced linear Klein-Gordon equation, the novelty concerning essentially the analysis of the maximal order terms. In particular, the method we propose here does not rely on any quantitative Egorov-type result.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on vector-like dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical cosmological model to explain the recent acceleration of the universe relies on a cosmological constant, and most dynamical dark energy and modified gravity model alternatives are based on scalar fields. Still, further alternatives are possible. One of these involves vector fields: under certain conditions, they can lead to accelerating universes while preserving large-scale homogeneity and isotropy. We report quantitative observational constraints on a model previously proposed by Armend\'ariz-Pic\'on and known as the cosmic triad. We consider several subclasses of the model, which generically is a parametric extension of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as two possible choices of the triad's potential. Our analysis shows that any deviations from this limit are constrained to be small. In particular the preferred present-day values of the matter density and the dark energy equation of state are fully consistent with those obtained, for the same datasets, in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0$CDM. The constraints mildly depend on the priors on the dark energy equation of state, specifically on whether phantom values thereof are allowed, while the choice of potential does not play a significant role since any such potential is constrained to be relatively flat.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Bundles and Holographic Space-time: the Hydrodynamic Approach to Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results of Jacobson, Carlip and Solodukhin, from the 1990s, suggest a hydrodynamic approach to quantum gravity in which a classical solution of Einstein's equations determines the density matrices of subsystems associated with causal diamonds in the "empty diamond" state of a corresponding quantum system. The subsystem operator algebras are finite dimensional and correspond to a UV cutoff $1 + 1$ dimensional field theory of fermions living on a "stretched horizon" near each diamond's holographic screen. The fields can be thought of as fluctuations of solutions of the screen's Dirac operator around that of the background geometry, expanded up to a maximal Dirac eigenvalue determined by the Carlip-Solodukhin relation between area and central charge. This cutoff renders the screen geometry "fuzzy". Quantum dynamics is defined in a Hilbert bundle over the space of time-like geodesics on the background geometry. A nesting of diamonds along a given geodesic defines a series of unitary embedding maps of diamond Hilbert spaces into each other, analogous to half sided modular flows in quantum field theory. These can be extended into a consistent set of unitary maps of each fiber Hilbert space into itself by a quantum version of the principle of relativity. According to the QPR, the largest diamond in the overlap between any two diamonds is identified with a tensor factor in each individual diamond Hilbert space, and must have the a density matrix with the same entanglement spectrum no matter which fiber dynamics is used to compute it. This brief review summarizes how these ideas play out in a variety of contexts in different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Dark Energy Phenomenology Across Different Parameterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter families: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent technical and conceptual advancements in the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity have enabled studies of the UV completion of Lorentzian Einstein gravity, emphasizing the role of the state dependence. We present here the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime, namely de Sitter spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges.</description>

Abstract: We assume the validity of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, as given in terms of the horizon area of the Bardeen regular black hole, and consider it as the fundamental thermodynamic equation. We derive and investigate the behavior of the main thermodynamic variables. Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we derive the geometric properties of the corresponding equilibrium space and show that the curvature contains information about the stability properties and phase transition structure of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is poly-homogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In even dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for odd higher dimensions there exists no non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of analytic models for a dark matter halo surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole sitting at the center of a galaxy, with a variable inner radius $r_{\text{in}}$ at which the density profile of the dark matter halo vanishes. We examine in detail how the three energy conditions are satisfied in such models. In particular, independent of concrete profile, we find that the three energy conditions are satisfied when $r_{\text{in}}\ge5M/2$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the black hole. This indicates it is crucial to include inner radius when discussing dark matter distributions. All our solutions expressed explicitly in closed form are particularly valuable for the studies of the gravitational waveforms of extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspirals and the nature of dark matter in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Field Equations in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity on fundamental metrics. This theory involves perturbative corrections to general relativity, as well as two scalar fields, the axion and the dilaton, that arise from Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity modifications respectively. The combined Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is motivated by a wide range of theoretical and phenomenological perspectives, including particle physics, string theory, and parity violation in the gravitational sector. In this work, we provide the complete set of field equations and equations of motion of the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory for a suite of fundamental metrics (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Schwarzschild, spherically symmetric, and perturbed Minkowski), under no prior assumptions on the behavior of the fields. The full set of field equations and equations of motion can be numerically solved and applied to specific observables under certain assumptions, and can be used to place constraints on the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Strong deflection of massive particles in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near a gravitating compact object, massive particles traveling along timelike geodesics are gravitationally deflected similarly to light. In this paper, we study the deflection angles of these particles in the strong deflection limit. This analytical approximation applies when particles in unbound orbits approach the compact object very closely, circle around it at a radius close to that of the unstable circular orbit, and eventually escape. While previous studies have provided results for particular metrics, we offer a general solution applicable to any static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime. After briefly reviewing the exact expression for the deflection angle of massive particles, we present a strong deflection limit analysis for this general case. The developed formulas are then applied to three particular metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Janis-Newman-Winicour.</description>

Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harada proposed a modified theory of gravity called Cotton gravity, and argued that it successfully explains the rotation curves of $84$ galaxies without the need of dark matter. In this work we use galaxy-galaxy lensing technique to test whether the modification effect of Cotton gravity can indeed be a viable substitute for dark matter. Using the spherically symmetric solution of Cotton gravity, we obtain the deflection angle via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the weak lensing shear. We use five galaxy catalogs divided in 5 stellar mass bins from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), each of which is further divided into blue star forming galaxy and red passive galaxy sub-catalogs. We find that Cotton gravity on its own has significant deviation from the measured galaxy-galaxy lensing signals, thus it cannot replace the role of dark matter. If we consider the combination of dark matter and Cotton gravity, the modification is tightly constrained. Our analysis also applies to other modified gravity theories whose an additional linear term appears in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: von Neumann algebras have been playing an increasingly important role in the context of gauge theories and gravity. The crossed product presents a natural method for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering it a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product of a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which means that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field theories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness of the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group containing the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies the centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide evidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we construct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We comment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion physics in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background and Individual Sources from Supermassive Binary Black Holes Based on Cosmological Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) groups have recently claimed the detection of nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), but the origin of this gravitational wave (GW) signal remains unclear. Nanohertz GWs generated by supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are one of the most important GW sources in the PTA band. Utilizing data from cosmological simulation, we construct a comprehensive dataset of SMBBHs within a mock observable universe incorporates the cosmic large-scale structure. We carry out an exhaustive analysis of the distribution characteristics of these merger events, as well as the GWB signals they produce. Specifically, we predict the characteristic amplitude of GWB to be $h_c=4.85\times10^{-16}$ at the frequency of ${\rm yr^{-1}}$, while the energy density of GWB signal exhibit an anisotropic part with $C_1/C_0\approx2.50\times10^{-3}\pm2.04\times10^{-3}$. We study the clustering pattern of the positional distribution of SMBBHs, and found that they show similar behavior with that of galaxies on relatively small scales. Furthermore, for the upcoming Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-PTA, we predict the spatial distribution, numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution of individual GW sources that may be detected with SNR$&gt;$8, and study the anisotropic properties in the spatial distribution of these individual GW sources. We finally investigated the impact of lensing effects and found that their influence is rather limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Statistics of Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19516</link>

Abstract: Recent detection of nHz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has stimulated intensive discussions about its physical origin. In principle, either supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) or processes in the early universe may be the sources. One key difference between the two lies in the statistics of the SGWB frequency power spectrum. In particular, the often assumed Gaussian random SGWB does not accurately describe the distribution of the collective SMBHB emission. In this work, we present a semi-analytical framework for calculating the non-Gaussian statistics of SGWB power expected from SMBHBs. We find that (a) wave interference between individual SMBHBs with indistinguishable observed frequencies and (b) the Poisson fluctuation of the source numbers, together shape the non-Gaussian statistics. Implementing the non-Gaussian statistics developed in this work, we investigate the sensitivity of current and future PTA datasets in distinguishing the origin of the SGWB through non-Gaussian information. Additionally, we find an interesting approximation of the non-Gaussian statistics, which has implications for accurately and practically treating non-Gaussianity in PTA Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>Geometric Entropies and their Hamiltonian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holographic theories, the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area operator plays a key role in our understanding of the emergence of semiclassical Einstein-Hilbert gravity. When higher derivative corrections are included, the role of the area is instead played by a more general functional known as the geometric entropy. It is thus of interest to understand the flow generated by the geometric entropy on the classical phase space. In particular, the fact that the associated flow in Einstein-Hilbert or Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity induces a relative boost between the left and right entanglement wedges is deeply related to the fact that gravitational dressing promotes the von Neumann algebra of local fields in each wedge to type II. This relative boost is known as a boundary-condition-preserving (BCP) kink-transformation. In a general theory of gravity (with arbitrary higher-derivative terms), it is straightforward to show that the flow continues to take the above geometric form when acting on a spacetime where the HRT surface is the bifurcation surface of a Killing horizon. However, the form of the flow on other spacetimes is less clear.
  In this paper, we use the manifestly-covariant Peierls bracket to explore such flows in two-dimensional theories of JT gravity coupled to matter fields with higher derivative interactions. The results no longer take a purely geometric form and, instead, demonstrate new features that should be expected of such flows in general higher derivative theories. We also show how to obtain the above flows using Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Reheating chiral dynamos with spin-0 and massive spin-1 torsions via chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00419</link>

Abstract: Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>
