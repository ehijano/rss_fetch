      <title>Nb3Sn coating of SRF cavity by co-sputtering from a composite target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deposited Nb3Sn film on the inner surface of a 2.6 GHz Nb superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity by co-sputtering using a composite of Nb and Sn tube targets in a DC cylindrical magnetron sputtering system, followed by thermal annealing of the coated cavity. An aluminum mockup cavity, replicating a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity geometry, was utilized to optimize the deposition parameters, resulting in co-sputtered Nb-Sn films with Sn content of 32 - 42 at. % on the beam tubes and equator positions. Several annealing conditions were investigated to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn film. The best co-sputtered Nb-Sn film was achieved after annealing at 600 C for 6 h, followed by annealing at 950 C for 1 h. The best process was applied to a Nb cavity, which was RF tested in cryogenic dewar. RF testing of the Nb3Sn-coated cavity demonstrated the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) close to the highest reported, achieving a Tc of 17.78 K. The Nb3Sn cavity underwent a light Sn recoating process, followed by additional RF testing, resulting in enhancement of the RF performance of the cavity, primarily due to the improved surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn coating.</description>

      <title>A Simulation of the Fermilab Main Injector Dual Power Amplifier Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermilab Main Injector accelerating cavities have sparking issues when they are run at voltages higher than those required by the PIP-II project. This is a problem Fermilab is working on as planning begins for the next upgrade to the accelerator complex. One of the methods being used to address the issue is the development of a CST Microwave Studio simulation to accurately model the PIP-II dual power amplifier cavities and identify which part(s) of the cavity is causing sparking to develop. The model will also be used to determine if changes to the cavity geometry may allow the cavity to be used at higher voltages before sparking occurs.</description>

      <title>Status and prospects of Muon g-2 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews the muon g-2 experiment, a cornerstone in precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics. The experiment measures the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with unprecedented accuracy, seeking potential discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results that might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model. We trace the evolution of this measurement from its beginnings at CERN in the 1960s to the current state-of-the-art experiment at Fermilab, highlighting the remarkable engineering achievements required to achieve parts-per-billion precision. Recent results from Runs 1-3 have achieved a systematic uncertainty of 70 ppb, exceeding design goals, while ongoing theoretical calculations continue to refine predictions. Despite these advances, the analysis remains statistics-limited, with continued data collection and novel experimental approaches at MUonE and J-PARC promising further insights into this fundamental physical quantity.</description>
