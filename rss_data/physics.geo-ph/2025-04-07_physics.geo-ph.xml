      <title>Direct density estimation using muon radiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muography or muon radiography estimates the density distribution of natural or anthropic structures by measuring the traversing flux of atmospheric muons. Muography has been implemented to image volcanoes, glaciers, tunnels, line-shores, pyramids, and dams. The mass variation of the structure is deduced by the ratio between the open-sky muon flux and the target traversing flux, resulting in a relative measurement of the density. We present a novel method for directly measuring the average density of the target. The methodology uses known muography variables such as open-sky and traversing muon flux, incident zenith angle, and muon path length. We validated the method with muography-simulated data from iron, aluminum, standard rock and water phantoms, as well as real data from the Khufu pyramid, the Eiger Glacier, and the Canfranc Underground Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Improve the estimate of the b-value in regional catalogs by means of the the b-more positive method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The b-value, which controls the slope of the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes, is a critical parameter in seismic forecasting. However, accurately measuring the true b-value is challenging due to the temporal and spatial variations in the completeness of instrumental seismic catalogs. In this study, we systematically compare traditional methods for estimating the b-value with newer approaches, specifically focusing on the b-more-positive estimator based on positive magnitude difference statistics. We conduct this comparison using both synthetic ETAS catalogs, with artificially introduced incompleteness, and instrumental catalogs from five regions: Japan, Italy, Southern California, Northern California, and New Zealand. Our results from synthetic ETAS catalogs reveal that traditional estimators tend to underestimate the b-value, while the b-more-positive estimator provides a more accurate measurement. Similar patterns are observed in instrumental catalogs, suggesting that traditional methods may also underestimate the true b-value in real datasets.</description>

      <title>How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ``path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.</description>

      <title>Climate adaptation of millet and sorghum varieties in North-Eastern Senegal: cross-referencing rainfall, thermal and phenological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) are the main rainfed cereals grown in North-Eastern Senegal. However, faced with constraints such as falling rainfall, rising temperatures and frequent dry spells, their production is tending to decline. This article examines the climatic constraints and other shocks suffered by rainfed millet varieties Souna__3, ICTP 8203, GB 8735, Gawane and Chakti, as well as those as sorghum CE__180-33, Payenne and Golob{\'e}, which are the main varieties released and currently grown in north-eastern Senegal. Based on data collected in Podor, Matam and Lingu{\`e}re, the article analyses the adaptation of different millet and sorghum varieties to climatic condition and their evolution over time The results show a rainfall deficit since the early 1970s, combined by greater thermal constraints. Analysis of the differences between cumulative rainfall and maximum evapotranspiration for varieties at different growth stages reveals constant water deficits for Souna__3 millet and CE 180-33 sorghum. In contrast, Chakti millet shows positive water balances in over 80% of years in the east and west of the study area, and in 47% of cases in the north. Only Chakti and ICTP 8203 are adapted to the climatic conditions of the eastern and western zones, with a probability of suitability of over 80% for the periods 1931-1969 and 1999-2020. However, none of the varieties is adapted to the climatic conditions in the north. In addition to these climatic constraints, the interviewed farmers attribute the decline in agricultural production to livestock straying, attacks by bird pests and parasitic infestations. exacerbate agricultural losses. It is therefore essential to develop complementary strategies including wider dissemination of varieties better adapted to current climatic conditions, such as Chakti and ICTP 8203, and the strengthening of crop protection systems, notably through biological control and integrated pest management.</description>

      <title>Strong ionospheric activity at the MWA site associated with plasma bubble measured by GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's ionosphere refracts radio signals, shifting the apparent position of radio sources. Wide-field measurements with a radio interferometer can measure the ionospheric distortion. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has the ability to capture ionospheric structures that are smaller than 100 km in extent. We report unusually strong ionospheric activity in MWA data during a magnetic storm on 2023 December 1. The duct-like structure (roughly 50 km $\times$ $&gt;$100 km) passes through the MWA field-of-view (FOV) with a velocity of ~ 100 m/s. The offsets of the apparent position of the radio source are more than 1 degree in the MWA observation data at around 180 MHz. By comparing the Total Electron Content (TEC) data obtained from the GNSS receiver network, we have found that the TEC fluctuations represented by a high Rate of TEC change index (ROTI) coincided with the strong ionospheric activity observed by the MWA. This result suggests that unusual ionospheric signatures detected by the MWA could be caused by plasma bubbles extending across Western Australia during a magnetic storm.</description>

      <title>Plasma and Thermal Processing Leading to Spatial and Temporal Variability of the Trapped O2 at Europa and Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe physical processes affecting the formation, trapping, and outgassing of molecular oxygen (O2) at Europa and Ganymede. Following Voyager measurements of their ambient plasmas, laboratory data indicated that the observed ions were supplied by and would in turn impact and sputtering their surfaces, decomposing the ice and producing thin O2 atmospheres. More than a decade later, Europa's ambient O2 was inferred from observations of the O aurora and condensed O2 bands at 5773 and 6275 angstroms were observed in Ganymede's icy surface. More than another decade later, the O2 atmosphere was shown to have a dusk/dawn enhancement, confirmed by Juno data. Although the incident plasma produces these observables, processes within the surface are still not well understood. Here we note that incident plasma produces a non-equilibrium defect density in the surface grains. Subsequent diffusion leads to the formation of voids and molecular products, some of which are volatile. Although some volatiles are released into their atmospheres, others are trapped at defects or in voids forming gas bubbles, which might be delivered to their subsurface oceans. Here we discuss how trapping competes with annealing of the radiation damage. We describe differences observed at Europa and Ganymede and roughly determine the trend with latitude of O2 bands on Ganymede's trailing hemisphere. This understanding is used to discuss the importance of condensed and adsorbed O2 as atmospheric sources, accounting for dusk/dawn enhancements and temporal variability reported in condensed O2 band depths. Since plasma and thermal annealing timescales affect the observed O2 variability on all of the icy moons, understanding the critical physical processes of O2 can help determine the evolution of other detected oxidants often suggested to be related to geological activity and venting.</description>

      <title>LOGLO-FNO: Efficient Learning of Local and Global Features in Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling high-frequency information is a critical challenge in scientific machine learning. For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of Navier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate high-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and vortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural networks depends on accurately reconstructing moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been well known that deep neural nets exhibit the so-called spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as a popular class of data-driven models in recent years for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for surrogate modeling in general. Although impressive results have been achieved on several PDE benchmark problems, FNOs often perform poorly in learning non-dominant frequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from the spectral bias inherent in neural networks and the explicit exclusion of high-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these issues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad range of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements: (i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolutions (ii) a high-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel frequency-sensitive loss term based on radially binned spectral errors. This introduction of a parallel branch for local convolutions reduces number of trainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of baseline FNO that relies solely on global convolutions. Experiments on three challenging PDE problems in fluid mechanics and biological pattern formation, and the qualitative and spectral analysis of predictions show the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art neural operator baselines.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on the Rotation-induced Reduction of Penetration Resistance in Sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soil-dwelling organisms have evolved diverse strategies for efficient subterranean movement. For example, the seeds of Erodium cicutarium and Pelargonium species employ continuous rotational motion for self-burial, while the angled worm lizard Agamodon angeliceps tunnels by oscillating its head around its trunk's axis. These rotational movements significantly reduce penetration resistance. This study presents comprehensive experiments investigating the effects of various factors on rotational penetration forces and energy consumption. Results reveal that force reduction follow an approximately hyperbolic decay with the tangential-to-axial velocity ratio ($u$). Penetrator geometry, particularly roundness and conical tip shape, is found to significantly influence reduction at low velocity ratios, whereas relative density and material type exhibit moderate impact. Reduction is also observed to increase with interfacial friction angle but decreases with confining pressure and depth. Energy consumption analysis shows that while penetration force-related energy decreases with $u$, total energy consumption increases due to rotational torque. For self-burrowing robot designs, lower velocity ratios are recommended to balance penetration force reduction and energy efficiency effectively.</description>

      <title>Controlled Latent Diffusion Models for 3D Porous Media Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous media presents a fundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous resolution of fine-scale pore structures while capturing representative elementary volumes. We introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity - a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent representation of multiple complex properties, including permeability, two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially reduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for digital rock physics applications.</description>

      <title>Discovery and inversion of the viscoelastic wave equation in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scientific machine learning, the task of identifying partial differential equations accurately from sparse and noisy data poses a significant challenge. Current sparse regression methods may identify inaccurate equations on sparse and noisy datasets and are not suitable for varying coefficients. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid framework that combines two alternating direction optimization phases: discovery and embedding. The discovery phase employs current well-developed sparse regression techniques to preliminarily identify governing equations from observations. The embedding phase implements a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN), enabling efficient processes for time-space iterations involved in discretized forms of wave equation. The RCNN model further optimizes the imperfect sparse regression results to obtain more accurate functional terms and coefficients. Through alternating update of discovery-embedding phases, essential physical equations can be robustly identified from noisy and low-resolution measurements. To assess the performance of proposed framework, numerical experiments are conducted on various scenarios involving wave equation in elastic/viscoelastic and homogeneous/inhomogeneous media. The results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent robustness and accuracy, even when faced with high levels of noise and limited data availability in both spatial and temporal domains.</description>
