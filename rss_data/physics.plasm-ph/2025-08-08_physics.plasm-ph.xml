      <title>Electrodeless Magnetohydrodynamic Local Force Generator for Aerocapture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system for planetary entry aerocapture. The system is advantaged over previous approaches by having the following two characteristics: (i) it can be deployed locally to one or various flow regions, and (ii) it does not make use of electrodes. Previous MHD systems for planetary entry were either electrodeless global systems or two-electrode local systems. The proposed novel MHD system employs two magnets to establish a current loop resulting in a Faraday electromotive force (EMF). The first magnet is positioned to ensure the magnetic field faces outward from the shell, while the second magnet is oriented to ensure the magnetic field faces inward toward the shell. Preliminary findings demonstrate that when located on the surface of an Earth entry capsule at a flight Mach number of 35, the novel electrodeless MHD system can generate forces several times greater than a two-electrode system while utilizing the same magnetic field strength. The study is conducted entirely through numerical simulation using CFDWARP, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that employs advanced numerical methods allowing for the full coupling between aerodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and non-neutral plasma sheaths. The physical model includes an 11-species finite-rate chemical solver including real gas effects, the drift-diffusion model for all charged species, along with an electric field potential equation that satisfies Gauss's law.</description>

      <title>Magnetic shear effects on ballooning turbulence in the boundary of fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of magnetic shear on ballooning-driven plasma edge turbulence is studied through nonlinear simulations complemented by linear numerical and analytical investigations. Nonlinear, 3D, global, flux-driven simulations using the GBS code show that the scale separation between radial, x, and poloidal, y, size of turbulent eddies, kx &lt;&lt; ky , considered by Ricci et al. (2008) and extensively used to predict pressure gradient lengths, SOL width, particle and heat fluxes, is observed with high magnetic shear. In contrast, for low magnetic shear, kx ~ ky is observed, with fluctuation properties resembling those shown by recent low-shear stellarator simulations reported in Coelho et al. (2024a). Global linear investigations of the ballooning mode qualitatively captures the transition in mode structure with varying magnetic shear, showing that kx &lt;&lt; ky is achieved with sufficiently strong poloidal mode coupling enhanced by increasing magnetic shear, resistivity, toroidal mode number, and equilibrium gradient scale length. This is confirmed by an analytical study considering a dominant poloidal mode and its sidebands, which highlights that the poloidal mode structure is determined by curvature and k parallel effects</description>

      <title>Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This information-theoretic analysis may provide a theoretical basis for regulating turbulence by controlling zonal flow.</description>

      <title>Detection of New Auroral Emissions at Io and Implications for Its Interaction with the Plasma Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observed Io's optical aurora in eclipse on six nights between 2022 and 2024 using Keck I/HIRES. Spectra revealed 13 new auroral emissions not identified previously, tripling the total number of optical emissions lines detected at Io. These included the O I lines at 777.4 and 844.6 nm, the Na I lines at 818.3 and 819.5 nm, the [S I] lines at 458.9 and 772.5 nm, the S I triplet at 922.3 nm, the [O II] lines at 732.0 and 733.0 nm and the [S II] lines at 406.9, 407.6, 671.6 and 673.1 nm. We leveraged these new detections by comparing with imaging data from the 2001 Cassini flyby to better understand the distribution of atmospheric species and their contribution to the observed auroral brightnesses. Our auroral emission model showed that the observed 557.7, 777.4 and 844.6 nm oxygen emission line brightnesses could be explained by excitation by electron impact of canonical 5 eV torus electrons on an atmosphere composed of O, SO2 and an isoelectronic proxy for SO. The SO2 emission did not decrease immediately after eclipse ingress, suggesting the emitting column may be restricted to higher altitudes. The derived O/SO2 mixing ratio was typically about 10%, but it also exhibited order-of-magnitude variance during some observations. Io's 630.0 nm [O I] brightness did not strongly vary with plasma sheet distance, suggesting electron flux at Io varies substantially beyond model predictions.</description>

      <title>Frobenius-Perron Operator Approach to the Beam-Beam Interaction in Circular Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike most publications devoted to the application of the self-consistent method of the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system to the study of beam-beam interaction, in this article an alternative strategy using the elegant approach of the Frobenius-Perron operator for symplectic twist maps has been developed. A detailed analysis of the establishment of an equilibrium density distribution in phase space, as well as the behavior of the perturbed distribution function with respect to the coherent stability of the two beams, has been carried out.
  Using the Renormalization Group technique for the reduction of the Frobenius-Perron operator, the case where the unperturbed rotation frequency (unperturbed betatron tune) of the map is far from any structural resonance driven by the beam-beam kick perturbation has been analyzed in detail. It has been shown that up to second order in the beam-beam parameter, the renormalized map propagator with nonlinear stabilization describes a random walk of the angle variable, implying that there exists an equilibrium distribution function depending only on the action variable.
  The linearized Frobenius-Perron operators for each beam imply a discrete form of the linearized Vlasov equations, which essentially comprises a new method for calculating coherent beam-beam instabilities using a matrix mapping technique. In the special case of an isolated coherent beam-beam resonance, a stability criterion for coherent beam-beam resonances has been found in closed form.
  An intriguing particular concerning the effect of repeated beam-beam collisions on collider luminosity has been derived explicitly. An addition of luminosity per kick (small though, of the order of the beam-beam parameter) in the course of successive beam-beam collisions could be achieved.</description>
