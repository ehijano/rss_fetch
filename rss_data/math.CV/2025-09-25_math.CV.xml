      <title>Partial sharing and cross sharing of entire function with its derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we investigate the uniqueness problem of a power of an entire function that share one value partially with it's linear differential polynomial and obtain a result, which improves several previous results in a large scale. Also in the paper we include some applications of our main result. Moreover, we solve the question raised by Wang and Liu (Value cross-sharing of meromorphic functions, Comput. Methods Funct. Theory (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s40315-023-00481-9) for a special case related to value cross-sharing.</description>

      <title>Values of Finite Distortion: Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove continuity for mappings $f \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, in the Sobolev class $W^{1,n}_{\text{loc}}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ that satisfy the inequality \[
  \lvert Df(x) \rvert^n \le K(x) \det Df(x) + \Sigma(x) \] whenever $K \in L^p_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)$ and $\Sigma \in L^q_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)$ with $p^{-1} + q^{-1} &lt; 1$. This closes a significant gap between existing methods and known counterexamples. The result is sharp, new even in the planar case, and opens a systematic study of mappings with values of finite distortion in geometric function theory. As a key part of the proof, we introduce an overlooked Sobolev-type inequality based on measures of superlevel sets.</description>

      <title>Higher order weighted Dirichlet type spaces with poly-superharmonic weights and Dirichlet type operators of finite order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study higher-order weighted Dirichlet integral and weighted Dirichlet type spaces $\mathscr D_{w,k}$ where the associated admissible weights arise from a class of positive poly-superharmonic functions on the open unit disc. We establish a generalized higher order version of the Local Douglas formula for computing the higher order weighted Dirichlet integral induced by Dirac measures supported on the open unit disc. Building on this formula, we analyze the properties of the multiplication operator $M_z$ acting on $\mathscr D_{w,k},$ proving that it is completely hyperexpansive of order $k$ for odd $k$ and completely hypercontractive of order $k$ for even $k$. To unify these cases, we introduce Dirichlet-type operators of finite order and construct model spaces corresponding to allowable tuples. This framework yields a model theorem for cyclic Dirichlet type operators of finite order, thereby extending well known model of cyclic completely hyperexpansive operators and the model of cyclic $m$-isometries.</description>

      <title>Persistence modules induced by inner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As well-known, inner functions play an important role in the study of bounded analytic function theory. In recent years, persistence module theory, as a main tool applied to Topological Data Analysis, has received widespread attention. In this paper, we aim to use persistence module theory to study inner functions. We introduce the persistence modules arised from the level sets of inner functions. Some properties of these persistence modules are shown. In particular, we prove that the persistence modules (potentially not of locally finite type) induced by a class of inner functions have interval module decompositions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interleaving distance of the persistence modules is continuous with respect to the supremum norm for a class of Blaschke products, which could be used to discuss the path-connectedness of Blaschke products. As an example, we provide an explicit formula for the interleaving distance of the persistence modules induced by the Blaschke products with order two.</description>

      <title>Absolutely Summing Toeplitz operators on Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $1\le p&lt;\infty$, let $F^p_\varphi$ be the Fock spaces on ${\mathbb C}^n$ with the weight function $\varphi$ that \(\varphi \in {\mathcal{C}}^{2}\left( {\mathbb{C}}^{n}\right)\) is real-valued and satisfies
  $
  m{\omega }_{0} \leq d{d}^{c}\varphi \leq M{\omega }_{0}
  $
  for two positive constants \(m\) and \(M\), \({\omega }_{0} = d{d}^{c}{\left| z\right| }^{2}\) is the Euclidean K\"{a}hler form on \({\mathbb{C}}^{n}\), \({d}^{c} = \frac{\sqrt{-1}}{4}\left( {\bar{\partial } - \partial }\right)\). In this paper, we completely characterize those positive Borel measure $\mu$ on ${\mathbb C}^n$ so that the induced Toeplitz operators $T_\mu$ is $r$-summing on $F_{\varphi}^{p}$ for $r \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By utilizing Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study double-sided actions of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ on $SL(3,\mathbb{C})/U$ and the associated quotients, where $U$ is a maximal unipotent subgroup of $SL(3,\mathbb{C})$. The main results of this paper are a sufficient condition for the double-sided quotient to agree with the quotient in terms of the geometric invariant theory (GIT), and an explicit necessary and sufficient condition for $SL(3,\mathbb{C})/U$ to agree with the $\chi$-stable locus in its affine closure. We apply this result to characterize certain complex structures on $SU(3)$ which are not left invariant by means of the GIT quotient.</description>

      <title>On the Absolute-Value Integral of a Brownian Motion with Drift: Exact and Asymptotic Formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the integral of the absolute value of a Brownian motion with drift. By establishing an asymptotic expansion of the space Laplace transform, we obtain series representations for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the integral, making use of Meijer's G-function. A functional recursive formula is derived for the moments, which is shown to yield only exponentials and Gauss' error function up to arbitrary orders, permitting exact computations. To obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for small- and large-deviation probabilities, we employ a marginal space-time Laplace transform and apply a newly developed generalization of Laplace's method to exponential Airy integrals. The impact of drift on the complete distribution of the integral is explored in depth. The resultant new formulae complement existing ones in the standard Brownian motion case to great extent in terms of both theoretical generality and modeling capacity and have been presented for easy implementation, which numerical experiments demonstrate.</description>

      <title>A method of solution for the inverse problem for $h$-functions of planar Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a planar domain $D$, the harmonic measure distribution function $h_D(r)$, with base point $z$, is the harmonic measure with pole at $z$ of the parts of the boundary which are within a distance $r$ of $z$. Equivalently it is the probability Brownian motion started from $z$ first strikes the boundary within a distance $r$ from $z$. We call $h_D$ the $h$-function of $D$, this function captures geometrical aspects of the domain, such as connectivity, or curvature of the boundary. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem: given a suitable function $h$, does there exist a domain $D$ such that $h = h_D$? To answer this, we first extend the concept of a $h$-function of a domain to one of a stopping time $\tau$ . By using the conformal invariance of Brownian motion we solve the inverse problem for that of a stopping time. The associated stopping time will be the projection of a hitting time of the real line. If this projection corresponds to the hitting time of a domain $D$, then this technique solves the original inverse problem. We have found a large family of examples such that the associated stopping time is that of a hitting time.</description>

      <title>Zero-free sector of the Wronski map on the totally nonnegative Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical result states that if $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$ with nonnegative coefficients, then $f(z)$ has no zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| &lt; \frac{\pi}{n}$ of the complex plane, and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Motivated by the Shapiro--Shapiro conjecture and related problems in real Schubert calculus, we generalize this result to Wronskians of polynomials. Namely, let $f_1(z), \dots, f_k(z)$ be linearly independent polynomials of degree at most $n$ whose coefficient matrix has all nonnegative $k\times k$ minors (that is, the polynomials span an element of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian in the sense of Lusztig and Postnikov). We show that the Wronskian polynomial $\operatorname{Wr}(f_1, \dots, f_k)$ has no complex zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| &lt; \frac{\pi}{n}$ (independent of $k$), and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Our proof uses classical results of Gantmakher and Krein (1950) and Obreschkoff (1923) on sign variation.</description>

      <title>Annihilating ideals and Agler--McCarthy spectral varieties in the bidisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed unit bidisc $\overline{\mathbb{D}}^2$ is known to be a spectral set for any pair $(T_1,T_2)$ of commuting contractions. When each $T_i$ is pure and has finite defect, the pair admits a much smaller spectral set: the closure of a distinguished variety $V$ inside the bidisc $\mathbb{D}^2$. We find conditions on $(T_1,T_2)$ that guarantee that the closure of $V$ is a minimal spectral set. In addition, we examine the relationship between $V$ and the annihilating ideal $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$ in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D}^2)$. While $V$ is typically strictly larger than the zero set of $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$, we isolate a natural constrained isometric co-extension $(S_1,S_2)$ of $(T_1,T_2)$ whose Taylor spectrum is contained in $V$ and is closely linked to the so-called support of $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$. We also characterize when $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$ is the ideal of functions vanishing on the joint point spectrum of $(S_1^*,S_2^*)$.</description>
