      <title>Skeletal editing by tip-induced chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeletal editing of cyclic molecules has garnered considerable attention in the context of drug discovery and green chemistry, with notable examples in solution-phase synthesis. Here, we extend the scope of skeletal editing to the single-molecule scale. We demonstrate tip-induced oxygen deletion and ring contraction of an oxygen-containing seven-membered ring on bilayer NaCl films to generate molecules containing the perylene skeleton. The products were identified and characterized by atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopies, which provided access to bond-resolved molecular structures and orbital densities. Insights into the reaction mechanisms were obtained by density functional theory calculations. Our work expands the toolbox of tip-induced chemistry for single-molecule synthesis.</description>

      <title>Topological Phononic Crystal on the Scale of Quasi-Ballistic Phonon Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon engineering technology has opened up the functional thermal management of semiconductor-based classical and quantum electronics at the micro- and nanoscales. However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal characteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic thermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon behaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be compatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological phononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and designable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study, we experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of quasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based topological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed through change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters of topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using topological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors were found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly, the topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in micro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results pave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena, such as quasi-ballistic phonons.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization in fractionally charged electron wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the localization transition in fractionally charged electron wave packets, which is injected into a quantum conductor by a single voltage pulse with arbitrary flux quantum. We show that the transition is unidirectional for individual electrons or holes. They always undergo a delocalization-to-localization transition as the flux increases. In contrast, the transition of the neutral electron-hole pairs is bidirectional. As the flux increases, the transition can be a localization-to-delocalization transition or vice versa, which is controlled via the long-time tail of the voltage pulse. The localization-to-delocalization transition occurs in the case of short-tailed pulses, which decay faster than Lorentzian. In this case, the directions of the transitions for the neutral eh pairs and individual electrons or holes are opposite. Certain localized neutral electron-hole pairs can first evolve into delocalized ones, then split into individual electrons and holes with localized wave functions, which gives a reentrant localization. The delocalization-to-localization transition occurs in the case of long-tailed pulses, which decay slower than Lorentzian. The reentrant localization vanishes in this case, as the directions of the two transitions are the same. It is also absent in the case of Lorentzian pulses, where the localized neutral electron-hole pairs cannot be excited at all.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Topology of Successive Quantum Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a symmetry classification for a general class of quantum feedback control. For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence of bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the symmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\dagger$ classes, specifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control. We demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors exhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare) measurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the ten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in engineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and imperfections.</description>

      <title>Anomalous inverse Faraday effect for graphene quantum dots in optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral photon interactions with two-dimensional (2D) materials enable unprecedented control of quantum phenomena. In this paper, we report anomalous inverse Faraday effects (IFE) in graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under linearly polarized optical vortex illumination, where transferred orbital angular momentum (OAM) generates light-induced magnetic moments. Employing our recently developed time-dependent quantum perturbation framework [Phys. Rev. B 110, 085425 (2024)], we demonstrate a counterintuitive observation: some reversed magnetic moments at off-axis positions occur-manifested as counter-rotating currents to the vortex helical wavefront. Phase-difference analysis and eigenmode decomposition resolve this anomaly, revealing that the OAM transfer efficiency is orders of magnitude weaker than its spin counterpart. This work establishes a new paradigm for optical OAM-to-magnetization conversion in quantum-engineered 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solution and thermodynamic properties of graphene in the presence of minimal length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, where the electrons propagating inside are described by the ultra-relativistic Dirac equation normally reserved for very high energy massless particles. In this work, we show that graphene under a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$ symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well determined. We find that the Dulong-Petit law is verified and the heat capacity is independent of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Sources of nonlinearity in the response of a driven nano-electromechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical resonators provide an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between electron transport and nonlinear mechanical motion. Externally driven suspended carbon nanotubes, containing an electrostatically defined quantum dot are especially promising. These devices possess two main sources of nonlinearity: the electromechanical coupling and the intrinsic contributions of the resonator that induce a Duffing-like nonlinear behavior. In this work, we observe the interplay between the two sources across different driving regimes. The main nonlinear feature we observe is the emergence of arch-like resonances in the electronic transport when the resonator is strongly driven. We show that our model is in good agreement with our experimental electron transport measurements on a suspended carbon nanotube. This characterization paves the way for the exploration of nonlinear phenomena using mesoscopic electromechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Engineering strong correlations in a perfectly aligned dual moir\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic collective phenomena emerge when bosons strongly interact within a lattice. However, creating a robust and tunable solid-state platform to explore such phenomena has been elusive. Dual moir\'e systems$-$compromising two Coulomb-coupled moir\'e lattices$-$offer a promising system for investigating strongly correlated dipolar excitons (composite bosons) with electrical control. Thus far, their implementation has been hindered by the relative misalignment and incommensurability of the two moir\'e patterns. Here we report a dual moir\'e system with perfect translational and rotational alignment, achieved by utilizing twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer to both generate an electrostatic moir\'e potential and separate MoSe$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers. We observe strongly correlated electron phases driven by intralayer interactions and identify interlayer Rydberg trions, which become trapped in the presence of the Mott insulating state. Importantly, our platform is electrostatically programmable, allowing the realization of different lattice symmetries with either repulsive or attractive interlayer interactions. In particular, we implement the latter scenario by optically injecting charges, which form a dipolar excitonic phase. Our results establish a versatile platform for the exploration and manipulation of exotic and topological bosonic quantum many-body phases.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Majorana bound states from accidental zero-energy modes with a microwave cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport measurements of hybrid nanowires often rely on the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak as a hallmark of Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, such signatures can also be produced by trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) or by quasi-Majorana bound states (QMBSs), complicating their unambiguous identification. Here we propose microwave absorption visibility, extracted from parity-dependent cavity-nanowire susceptibility measurements, as a complementary probe of MBSs nonlocality. We study a Rashba spin-orbit nanowire consisting of a proximitized superconducting segment and an uncovered quantum-dot region, capacitively coupled to a single-mode microwave cavity. We show that true MBSs yield finite visibility only when both MBSs are simultaneously coupled to the cavity, reflecting their intrinsic nonlocality. In contrast, ABSs and QMBSs exhibit visibility extrema even when the cavity couples only locally to part of the nanowire. We further demonstrate that this distinction persists in the presence of Gaussian disorder, which may otherwise generate trivial subgap states. Motivated by recent experiments, we also analyze ``poor man's" Majoranas in double-quantum-dot setups, where analytical results confirm the same nonlocal visibility criterion. Finally, we discuss a cavity-driven scheme for initializing the electronic system in a given parity state. Our results establish cavity-based visibility as a robust and versatile probe of MBSs, providing a clear route to distinguish them from trivial zero-energy states in hybrid superconducting platforms.</description>

      <title>Band geometric transverse current driven by inhomogeneous AC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical theory for electron wavepacket dynamics in the presence of an inhomogeneous AC electric field. While static electric-field gradients are known to generate charge transport governed by the quantum metric, we show that AC field gradients induce an additional geometric current that vanishes in the DC limit. This response originates from a novel band-geometric quantity, the higher-order connection (HOC) tensor, constructed from cubic products of interband Berry connections. We derive explicit expressions for the AC current and identify the symmetry conditions under which it arises. Remarkably, inhomogeneous AC fields can generate an anomalous Hall-like response even in nonmagnetic systems. Applying the theory to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, we demonstrate that the HOC-induced response produces a measurable Hall current peaking at band edges. These results establish inhomogeneous AC fields as a powerful probe of higher-order band geometric quantities beyond Berry curvature and the quantum metric.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity longitudinal magnetoconductivity in time-reversal symmetry broken materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity} (OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture. Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.</description>

      <title>QDFlow: A Python package for physics simulations of quantum dot devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Landau-Zener formula via functional equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02576v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and does not involve any sophisticated mathematics. Our work provides insights into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability, and shows that the Landau-Zener formula can be viewed as a consequence of integrability, though the two-level Landau-Zener Hamiltonian itself does not satisfy the integrability conditions.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Generation of Continuous-Variable Cluster States in a Phononic Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are multipartite entangled states that are maximally connected and resilient to decoherence, making them valuable resources for quantum information processing. Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states have been extensively investigated for such applications. Here we present a pulsed protocol for generating CV cluster states in a phononic quantum network composed of phonon waveguides, mechanical resonators, and optical cavities. A key feature of this architecture is the modular design, where pairs of mechanical modes act as building blocks with only local, tunable interactions between mechanical and cavity modes. The scheme is scalable, requiring just $4N$ driving tones for $N$ mechanical resonators. We characterize the resulting cluster states by evaluating the nullifiers of the CV modes. We also study the effects of dissipation, showing that strong squeezing with large phonon occupations can degrade the generated cluster states under finite mechanical and optical losses. As a direct application, we demonstrate that distant mechanical modes can be entangled via local measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamically reconfigurable topological routing in nonlinear photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation path of topologically protected states is bound to the interface between regions with different topology, and as such, the functionality of linear photonic devices leveraging these states is fixed during fabrication. Here, we propose a mechanism for dynamic control over a driven dissipative system's local topology, yielding reconfigurable topological interfaces and thus tunable paths for protected routing. We illustrate our approach in non-resonantly pumped polariton lattices, where the nonlinear interaction between the polaritons and the exciton reservoir due to non-resonant pumping can yield a dynamical change of the topology. Moreover, using a continuous model of the polariton system based on a driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation alongside the spectral localizer framework, we show that the local changes in the nonlinear non-Hermitian system's topology are captured by a local Chern marker. Looking forward, we anticipate such reconfigurable topological routing will enable the realization of novel classes of topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian amplitude damping in a central spin model with random couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics is central to quantum information processing, as memory effects strongly influence coherence preservation, metrology, and communication. In this work, we investigate the role of stochastic system--bath couplings in shaping non-Markovian behavior of open quantum systems, using the central spin model within a time-convolutionless master equation framework. We show that the character of the reduced dynamics depends jointly on the intrinsic memory of the environment and on the structure of the system--environment interaction. In certain regimes, the dynamics simplify to pure dephasing, while in general both amplitude damping and dephasing contribute to the evolution. By employing two complementary measures: the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) flow and the Breuer--Laine--Piilo (BLP) measure, we demonstrate that QFI flow may fail to witness memory effects in weak-coupling and near-resonant regimes, whereas the BLP measure still detects information backflow. Furthermore, external modulation of the interaction kernel produces qualitatively richer behavior, including irregular and frequency-dependent revivals of non-Markovianity. These results clarify the physical origin of memory effects, highlight the limitations of single-witness approaches, and suggest that stochasticity and modulation can be harnessed to engineer robust, noise-resilient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Systematic Schrieffer-Wolff-transformation approach to Josephson junctions: quasiparticle effects and Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) to analyze Josephson junctions between superconducting leads described by the charge-conserving BCS theory. Starting from the single-electron tunneling terms, we directly recover the conventional effective Hamiltonian, $-E_J\cos\hat{\varphi}$, with an operator-valued phase bias $\hat{\varphi}$. The SWT approach has the advantage that it can be systematically extended to more complex scenarios. We show that if a Bogoliubov quasiparticle is present its motion couples to that of Cooper pairs, introducing correlated dynamics that reshape the energy spectrum of the junction. Furthermore, higher-order terms in the SWT naturally describe Josephson harmonics, whose amplitudes are directly related to the microscopic properties of the superconducting leads and the junction. We derive expressions that could facilitate tuning the ratio between the different harmonics in a controlled way.</description>

      <title>Strain-tuned magnetoelectric properties of monolayer NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br): a first-principles analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using \textit{ab initio} methodology, we reveal a strain-mediated approach to precisely tune the magnetoelectric coupling and spin-driven emergent polarization of NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br) monolayers. In the absence of strain, these systems spontaneously stabilize non-collinear spin states that break the inversion symmetry, inducing a ferroelectric polarization in the plane of the material. We show that biaxial and uniaxial strains broadly modulate the magnetoelectric response in these materials through two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct modification of the magnetoelectric tensor components, and (ii) tuning of the characteristic propagation vectors of a spin texture. This dual mechanism enables precise control over the magnitude of the spin-induced electric polarization of these materials. With respect to the achievable magnitude of the electric polarization, we demonstrate the critical role of third-nearest-neighbor spin-pair contributions, which can increase under strain to levels that compete with or even exceed the polarization driven by first-nearest-neighbor effects. These findings offer important insights into low-dimensional piezo-magnetoelectricity and expand the possibilities for designing multifunctional two-dimensional straintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>

      <title>Effective conduction-band model for zincblende III-V semiconductors in the presence of strain: tuning the properties of bulk crystals and nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain provides a powerful knob to tailor the electronic properties of semiconductors. Simple yet accurate approximations that capture strain effects in demanding simulations of mesoscopic nanostructures are therefore highly desirable. However, for III-V compounds, key materials for quantum applications, such approaches remain comparatively underdeveloped. In this work, we derive a compact, effective Hamiltonian that describes the conduction band of zincblende III-V semiconductors incorporating strain effects. Starting from the eight-band k$\cdot$p model with Bir-Pikus corrections, we perform a folding-down procedure to obtain analytical expressions for conduction-band strain-renormalized parameters, including the effective mass, chemical potential, spin-orbit coupling, and $g$-factor. The model reproduces full multiband results under small to moderate strain, while retaining a form suitable for device-scale calculations. We benchmark the model for bulk deformations and apply it to representative nanostructures, such as core.shell nanowires and planar heterostructures. Our results provide a practical and versatile tool for incorporating strain into the design of III-V semiconductor devices, enabling reliable predictions of their properties with direct implications for spintronic, straintronic, optoelectronic, and topological quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Mixed Triplet-Singlet Order Parameter in Decoupled Superconducting 1H Monolayers of Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of unconventional superconductivity, where the order parameter deviates from simple isotropic s-wave pairing, is a central puzzle in condensed matter physics. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal.</description>

      <title>Creation of domain-wall Skyrmions in chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the capture of a magnetic Skyrmion into a domain wall (DW) structure in chiral magnets and find that in the respective ground states of the DW and the Skyrmion, they repel each other. This means that an isolated magnetic Skyrmion cannot a priori enter the DW and become a DW-Skyrmion. However, rotating the DW's phase away from the stable phase may cause the successful capture and hence creation of a stable bound state of a magnetic Skyrmion and a DW: the DW-Skyrmion. At certain distances, the DW may also destroy the magnetic Skyrmion by inducing shrinkage of the latter. This happens as the isolated magnetic Skyrmion has negative DMI energy, whereas the DW-Skyrmion has positive DMI energy; in a finite range from the DW, the magnetic Skyrmion can be pushed to have vanishing DMI energy, for which it collapses to a point. En passant, we find the possibility of pair creation of a Skyrmion anti-DW-Skyrmion pair and a creation of more than one DW-Skyrmions by a Kibble-like mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity naturally breaks down the adiabaticity and thus leads to non-Abelian behaviors in multi-band systems. Here, we study how non-Abelian properties emerge in non-Hermitian systems by considering a multi-band non-Hermitian model -- the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) ladder that is formed by coupling two nonreciprocal SSH chains. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analytically obtain the exact phase diagrams of the geometry of band structure classified by its complex value and gap type, and of the non-Abelian topology based on a newly defined gauge-invariant winding number under the chiral symmetry. Under open boundary conditions, we find that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit but breaks down for finite sizes along with the emergence of critical non-Hermitian skin effects when the inter-leg coupling is weak, where the decaying length $\xi$ of the bulk skin modes varies with the system size $L$, satisfying the scale-free power law $\xi\propto L$. Finally, we demonstrate the non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state subject to an external constant force in the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime in comparison with the non-Hermitian Wilson lines. Our work may stimulate further interests in nontrivial non-Abelian behaviors in non-Hermitian and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport and Molecular Sensing in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured with Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and electrical measurements to investigate local electronic transport in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that quantum transport in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied with a conducting atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Scanning gate microscopy (SGM) reveals a clear p-type response in which local gating modulates the source-drain current, while scanning impedance microscopy (SIM) indicates corresponding shifts of the Fermi level under different gating conditions. The observed transport behavior arises from the combined effects of the AFM tip induced Fermi level shifts and defect mediated scattering. These results show that resonant scattering associated with impurities or structural defects plays a central role and highlight the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on rGO conduction. Consistent with this electrostatic control, the device also exhibits chemical gating and sensing: during exposure to electron-withdrawing molecules (acetone), the source-drain current increases reversibly and returns to baseline upon purging with air. Repeated cycles over 15 minutes show reproducible amplitudes and recovery. Using a simple transport model we estimate an increase of about 40 percent in carrier density during exposure, consistent with p-type doping by electron-accepting analytes. These findings link nanoscale electrostatic control to macroscopic sensing performance, advancing the understanding of charge transport in rGO and underscoring its promise for nanoscale electronics, flexible chemical sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the study of stacking faults in weak topological insulators and the observation of magnetic domain walls in MnBi$_{2n}$Te$_{3n+1}$, we explore the topological properties of magnetic domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators. We develop two tight-binding models for two different types of antiferromagnetic topological insulators: the first type obtained by adding antiferromagnetic order to a strong topological insulator, and another built from stacked Chern insulating layers with alternating Chern numbers. Both systems are dual topological insulators, i.e. they are at the same time antiferromagnetic and crystalline topological insulators, but differ by the type of mirror symmetry protecting the crystalline phase: spinful versus spinless. We show that in the spinful case the mirror Chern number is invariant under time reversal and that it changes sign in the spinless case. This influences the properties of the two systems in the presence of a magnetic domain wall, which we model as an interface between two regions of opposite magnetization. In the first type, the bulk of the magnetic domain wall is gapped but the defect will host chiral edge states when it ends on an external ferromagnetic surface. In the second, due to the change in the sign of the mirror Chern number, the magnetic domain wall is a two-dimensional embedded semimetal with 2D gapless states protected by mirror symmetry. Our results show that magnetic domain walls can be a source of non-trivial topology, allowing to generate and manipulate gapless states within the bulk and the ferromagnetic surfaces of antiferromagnetic topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: We propose a pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI) mechanism by establishing a mesoscopic many-particle Rashba Hamiltonian. In lowest order, this Hamiltonian self-consistently describes exciton spin relaxation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) due to local electric fields caused by spatial asymmetries in the dielectric environment. For a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77 K showing a meV bright-dark splitting, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with larger bright-dark splitting.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\"odinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a central task for quantum information processing, enabling quantum cryptography, computation, and state certification. Traditional QST relies on projective measurements of single- and two-qubit Pauli operators, requiring the system of interest to be isolated from environmental dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring currents and associated transport quantities flowing through a quantum system in an open configuration enable the reconstruction of its quantum state. This result relies on an exact relation between transport quantities and the Krylov subspaces associated with the Lindbladian which encodes the dynamical evolution of an open quantum system. We illustrate this transport approach to QST with the explicit example of a two-qubit system embedded in a two-terminal setup. As a direct consequence of our framework, we are able to provide a transport-based entanglement measure to certify the presence of quantum correlations, expressing the concurrence in terms of current averages and correlations function only. Our findings are analytical, providing fundamental insights into quantum information processing in open quantum systems. They establish new connections between the fields of mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Spin of fractional quantum Hall neutral modes and "missing states" on a sphere</title>

Abstract: A low-energy neutral quasiparticle in a fractional quantum Hall system appears in the latter's energy spectrum on a sphere as a series of many-body excited states labeled by the angular momentum $L$ and whose energy is a smooth function of $L$ in the limit of large sphere radius. We argue that the signature of a nonvanishing spin (intrinsic angular momentum) $s$ of the quasiparticle is the absence, in this series, of states with total angular momentum less than $s$.We reinterpret the missing of certain states, observed in an exact-diagonalization calculation of the spectrum of the $\nu=7/3$ FQH state in a wide quantum well as well as in many proposed wave functions for the excited states as a consequence of the spin-2 nature of the zero-momentum magnetoroton.</description>

      <title>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</title>

Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a hidden Markov model</title>

Abstract: Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal prefiltering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of hot spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous generation and transfer of mechanical noise squeezing</title>

Abstract: Optomechanical interactions between mechanical oscillators and an electromagnetic field induce controllable modifications in mechanical fluctuation. When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements.</description>
