      <title>The spectrum of magnetized turbulence in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy is magnetized, compressible and turbulent, influencing many key ISM properties, like star formation, cosmic ray transport, and metal and phase mixing. Yet, basic statistics describing compressible, magnetized turbulence remain uncertain. Utilizing grid resolutions up to $10,080^3$ cells, we simulate highly-compressible, magnetized ISM-style turbulence with a magnetic field maintained by a small-scale dynamo. We measure two coexisting kinetic energy cascades, $\mathcal{E}_{{\rm kin}}(k) \propto k^{-n}$, in the turbulence, separating the plasma into scales that are non-locally interacting, supersonic and weakly magnetized $(n=2.01\pm 0.03\approx 2)$ and locally interacting, subsonic and highly magnetized $(n=1.465\pm 0.002\approx 3/2)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. We show that the $3/2$ spectrum can be explained with scale-dependent kinetic energy fluxes and velocity-magnetic field alignment. On the highly magnetized modes, the magnetic energy spectrum forms a local cascade $(n=1.798\pm 0.001\approx 9/5)$, deviating from any known \textit{ab initio} theory. With a new generation of radio telescopes coming online, these results provide a means to directly test if the ISM in our Galaxy is maintained by the compressible turbulent motions from within it.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for realistic and fast generated \textit{Euclid}-like data for weak lensing analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and mitigating measurement systematics in weak lensing (WL) analysis requires large datasets of realistic galaxies with diverse morphologies and colors. Missions like Euclid, the Nancy Roman Space Telescope, and Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time will provide unprecedented statistical power and control over systematic uncertainties. Achieving the stringent shear measurement requirement of $\lvert m \rvert &lt; 10^{-3}$ demands analyzing $10^9$ galaxies. Accurately modeling galaxy morphology is crucial, as it is shaped by complex astrophysical processes that are not yet fully understood. Subtle deviations in shape and structural parameters can introduce biases in shear calibration. The interplay between bulges, disks, star formation, and mergers contributes to morphological diversity, requiring simulations that faithfully reproduce these features to avoid systematics in shear measurements. Generating such a large and realistic dataset efficiently is feasible using advanced generative models like denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). In this work, we extend Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data across Euclid's broad optical band using CANDELS and develop a generative AI tool to produce realistic Euclid-like galaxies while preserving morphological details. We validate our tool through visual inspection and quantitative analysis of galaxy parameters, demonstrating its capability to simulate realistic Euclid galaxy images, which will address WL challenges and enhance calibration for current and future cosmological missions.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: Unraveling the Evolution of Galaxy Size and Related Properties at $2&lt;z&lt;10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure galaxy sizes from $2 &lt; z &lt; 10$ using COSMOS-Web, the largest-area JWST imaging survey to date, covering $\sim$0.54 deg$^2$. We analyze the rest-frame optical (~5000A) size evolution and its scaling relation with stellar mass ($R_e\propto M_*^\alpha$) for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, the slope $\alpha$ remains approximately 0.20 at $2 &lt; z &lt; 8$, showing no significant evolution over this redshift range. At higher redshifts, the slopes are $-0.13 \pm 0.15$ and $0.37 \pm 0.36$ for $8 &lt; z &lt; 9$ and $9 &lt; z &lt; 10$, respectively. At fixed galaxy mass, the size evolution for star-forming galaxies follows $R_e \propto (1+z)^{-\beta}$, with $\beta = 1.21 \pm 0.05$. For quiescent galaxies, the slope is steeper $\alpha\sim 0.5$-$0.8$ at $2 &lt; z &lt; 5$, and $\beta=0.81\pm0.26$. We find that the size-mass relation is consistent between UV and optical at $z &lt; 8$ for star-forming galaxies. However, we observe a decrease in the slope from UV to optical at $z &gt; 8$, with a tentative negative slope in the optical at $8 &lt; z &lt; 9$, suggesting a complex interplay between intrinsic galaxy properties and observational effects such as dust attenuation. We discuss the ratio between galaxies' half-light radius, and underlying halos' virial radius, $R_{vir}$, and find the median value of $R_e/R_{vir}=2.7\%$. The star formation rate surface density evolves as $\log\Sigma_\text{SFR} = (0.20\pm0.08)\,z+(-0.65\pm0.51)$, and the $\Sigma_\text{SFR}$-$M_*$ relation remains flat at $2&lt;z&lt;10$. Lastly, we identify a threshold in stellar mass surface density $\log\Sigma_e\sim9.5$-$10\, M_{\odot}/kpc^2$ marking the transition to compact, quenched galaxies from extended, star-forming progenitors. In summary, our findings show that the extensive COSMOS-Web dataset at $z &gt; 3$ provides new insights into galaxy size and related properties in the rest-frame optical.</description>

      <title>Galactic Accelerations from the GD-1 Stream Suggest a Tilted Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold dark matter halos are expected to be triaxial and often tilted relative to the stellar disk. Stellar streams provide a sensitive tracer of the Milky Way's halo shape, though models for the Galactic potential are typically limited to simple, symmetric functional forms. Here, we measure the Galactic acceleration field along the GD-1 stellar stream using a direct differentiation of the stream's track in phase-space. Using a fully data-driven catalog of stream members from Gaia, SDSS, LAMOST, and DESI, we map the stream in 6D phase-space. We fit splines to the stream track, and infer cylindrical acceleration components $a_R = -2.5 \pm_{0.1}^{0.2}, \ a_z = -1.8\pm 0.1, \ a_\phi = 0.2\pm 0.1~\rm{km \ s^{-1} \ Myr^{-1}}$ at $(R,z,\phi) = (11.9~\rm{kpc}, 7.3~\rm{kpc}, 171.1~\rm{deg})$. We measure mass enclosed within $14~\rm{kpc}$ of $1.4\pm 0.1 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ and z-axis density flattening of $q_{\rho, z} = 0.81\pm^{0.06}_{0.03}$, both consistent with previous estimates. However, we find a 2$\sigma$ deviation from an axisymmetric acceleration field, which can be explained by a triaxial dark matter halo with axis ratios 1:0.75:0.70. The major axis of the halo is consistent with a tilt of $18~\rm{deg}$ above the Galactic plane in the direction of the Sun. The magnitude and direction of the tilt are consistent with measurements of the Milky Way's stellar halo from Gaia and the H3 survey. A tilted triaxial halo has important consequences for orbit-integration-based studies of the Galaxy, and can be further tested by deriving acceleration constraints from multiple streams.</description>

      <title>Joint Survey Processing. III. Compact Oddballs in the COSMOS Field -- Little Red Dots and Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the HST ACS G800L grism spectroscopy observation of the faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the COSMOS field at redshift of 6 selected by the point-source morphology and the photometry drop-off at 8000\AA. Among the sample of 7 objects, only one is detected by multiple bands, and has similar shape of spectral energy distribution as the so-called ``little red dots'' JWST selected AGN candidates, but our object is 3 magnitude brighter than the JWST sample. We draw the upper limit of the AGN luminosity function $\Phi=1.1\times 10^{-7}$Mpc$^3$ mag$^{-1}$ for $M_{UV}$=$-21$ at redshift of 6. The rest of the sample shows inconsistent flux density when comparing magnitudes of HST ACS F814W to the Subaru $i$-band and $z$-band magnitudes combined. The HST ACS G800L grism observation shows that this inconsistency cannot be created from an emission line. Therefore, we speculate that these objects are transients with the light curve decay timescale at most 6 years in observed frame.</description>

      <title>ASKAP Discoveries of Giant Radio Galaxies in the Sculptor field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 15 well-resolved giant radio galaxies (GRGs) with angular sizes &gt;5 arcmin and physical sizes &gt;1 Mpc in wide-field Phased Array Feed 944 MHz observations on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We identify their host galaxies, examine their radio properties as well as their environment, and classify their morphologies as FR I (4), FR II (8), intermediate FR I/II (2), and hybrid (1). The combined ~40 deg^2 ASKAP image of the Sculptor field, which is centred near the starburst galaxy NGC 253, has a resolution of 13" and an rms sensitivity of &gt;10 microJy/beam. The largest GRGs in our sample are ASKAP J0057-2428 (zphot = 0.238), ASKAP J0059-2352 (zphot = 0.735) and ASKAP J0107-2347 (zphot = 0.312), for which we estimate linear projected sizes of 2.7, 3.5 and 3.8 Mpc, respectively. In total we catalog 232 extended radio galaxies of which 77 (33%) are larger than 0.7 Mpc and 35 (15%) are larger than 1 Mpc. The radio galaxy densities are 5.8 deg^-2 (total) and 0.9 (1.9) deg^-2 for those larger than 1 (0.7) Mpc, similar to previous results. Furthermore, we present the ASKAP discovery of a head-tail radio galaxy, a double-lobe radio galaxy with a spiral host, and radio emission from several galaxy clusters. As the ASKAP observations were originally conducted to search for a radio counterpart to the gravitational wave detection GW190814 (z ~ 0.05), we highlight possible host galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Resolved ALMA [CII] 158 micron Observations at Cosmic Noon: ISM Structure and Dynamics of Starbursting QSO SDSSJ1000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved Alma Band-9 observations of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine structure line from an optically selected quasar, SDSS J100038.01+020822.4 (J1000), at z=1.8275. By utilizing [OI] 63 $\mu$m line observations from Herschel/PACS and constructing a detailed dust SED using Herschel and Spitzer archival imaging data, we show that the [CII] line emission is well explained by a photodissociation region (PDR) model, in which the emission arises from the surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to far-UV radiation fields $\sim 5\cdot10^3$ times the local interstellar radiation field (G$_0$). We find a factor of 30 variation in spatially resolved [CII]/Far-IR continuum across the source which is explained by the reduced fraction of cooling via [CII] line emission at such high far-UV field strengths. By matching derived PDR parameters to the observed far-IR line and continuum intensities we derive cloud size-scales and find that typical cloud radii in J1000 are $\sim$3.5 pc perhaps indicating an ISM that is highly fractured due to intense star formation activity. We model the galaxy dynamically and find that the [CII] emission is contained within a compact, dynamically cold disk with v/$\sigma$=6.2, consistent with cosmological simulations. We also report the discovery of a companion galaxy to j1000 confirmed by the detection of [CII] and use recently obtained JWST/NirCAM imaging of the system to argue for J1000 being an interacting system. With total stellar mass $\sim 1.5 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and main-component dynamical mass $\gtrsim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, the J1000 system is a progenitor to the most massive galaxies seen in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Infrared Spectroscopy of Pentagon-Containing PAHs: Indenyl and Fluorenyl Anions and Indenyl Cation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) ions are crucial intermediates in interstellar chemistry and may play a key role in the infrared emission features observed in space. Here, we investigate the infrared spectra of the indenyl (C$_9$H$_7^-$) and fluorenyl (C$_{13}$H$_9^-$) anions and the indenyl cation (C$_9$H$_7^+$) using infrared pre-dissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy. The experiments were performed in a cryogenic 22 pole ion trap at the FELion beamline of the tunable free-electron laser FELIX. Spectral analysis of the two anionic PAHs, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) computations, revealed key vibrational modes near 1300 cm$^{-1}$, making these ions potential carriers of the 7.7 {\mu}m PAH emission band seen in many astronomical objects. The feature-rich spectrum of cationic indenyl could not be entirely explained by modeling through time-independent anharmonic DFT calculations. Although a better match has been achieved through molecular dynamics simulations, we cannot completely rule out the presence of multiple cationic isomers of the H-loss fragments of indene in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Wide Binaries from GAIA DR3 : testing GR vs MOND with realistic triple modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an updated test for modifications of gravity from a sample of wide-binary stars from GAIA DR3, and their sky-projected relative velocities. Here we extend on our earlier 2023 study, using several updated selection cuts aimed at reducing contamination from triple systems with an undetected third star. We also use improved mass estimates from FLAMES, and we add refinements to previous modelling of the triple and other populations and the model-fitting. We fit histograms of observed vs Newtonian velocity differences to a flexible mixture of binary + triple populations with realistic eccentricity distributions, plus unbound flyby and random-chance populations. We find as before that Newtonian models provide a significantly better fit than MOND, though improved understanding of the triple population is necessary to make this fully decisive.</description>

      <title>A new quasar strongly-lensed candidate by the galaxy cluster WHJ0400-27 with a $18''$ image-separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay cosmography (TDC) using multiply-lensed quasars (QSOs) by galaxies has recently emerged as an independent and competitive tool to measure the value of the Hubble constant. Lens galaxy clusters hosting multiply-imaged QSOs, when coupled with an accurate and precise knowledge of their total mass distribution, are equally powerful cosmological probes. However, less than ten such systems have been identified to date. Our study aims to expand the limited sample of cluster-lensed QSO systems by identifying new candidates within rich galaxy clusters. Starting from a sample of ~$10^5$ galaxy cluster candidates (Wen &amp; Han, 2022), built from Dark Energy Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer imaging data, and a highly-pure catalogue of over one million QSOs, based on Gaia DR3 data, we cross-correlate them to identify candidate lensed QSOs near the core of massive galaxy clusters. Our search yielded 3 lensed double candidates over an area of ~$5000$ sq. degree. In this work, we focus on the best candidate consisting of a double QSO with Gaia-based redshift of 1.35, projected behind a moderately rich cluster (WHJ0400-27) at $z_{phot}=0.65$. Based on a first spectroscopic follow-up study, we confirm the two QSOs at $z=1.345$, with indistinguishable spectra, and a brightest cluster galaxy at $z=0.626$. These observations seem to support the strong lensing nature of this system, although some tension emerges when the cluster mass from a preliminary lens model is compared with that from other mass proxies. We also discuss the possibility that such system is a rare physical association of two distinct QSOs with a projected physical distance of ~$150$ kpc. If further spectroscopic observations confirm its lensing nature, such a rare lens system would exhibit one of the largest image separations observed to date ($\Delta\vartheta=17.8''$), opening interesting TDC applications.</description>

      <title>H-, He-like recombination spectra -- V: On the dependence of the simulated line intensities on the number of electronic levels of the atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the dependence of the simulated intensities of recombination lines from hydrogen and helium atoms on the number of $n\ell$-resolved principal quantum numbers included in the calculations. We simulate hydrogen and helium emitting astrophysical plasmas using the code Cloudy and show that, if not enough $n\ell$-resolved levels are included, recombination line intensities can be predicted with significant errors than can be more than 30\% for H~I IR lines and 10\% for He~I optical lines ($\sim$20\% for He~I IR recombination lines) at densities $\sim1\text{cm}^{-3}$, comparable to interstellar medium. This can have consequences in several spectroscopic studies where high accuracy is required, such as primordial helium abundance determination. Our results indicate that the minimum number of resolved levels included in the simulated hydrogen and helium ions of our spectral emission models should be adjusted to the specific lines to be predicted, as well as to the temperature and density conditions of the simulated plasma.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic fields exist in and around galaxies, but the properties of these fields have not been fully explored due to the challenges inherent in observing and modeling them. In this Note, we explore the differences in magnetic field strength of central and satellite galaxies from the magnetohydrodynamic TNG100 simulation. We find that on average, magnetic fields in satellite galaxies are roughly an order of magnitude stronger than those of central galaxies with comparable masses. The difference is greater for satellites that have already approached within $1 R_{200}$ of their host galaxies. These results indicate that magnetic fields in satellite galaxies are amplified by environmental processes as they fall into a host halo.</description>

      <title>Rapidly varying ionization features in a Quasi-periodic Eruption: a homologous expansion model for the spectroscopic evolution</title>

Abstract: Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are recurring bursts of soft X-ray emission from supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which a growing class of models explains via extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). QPEs exhibit blackbody-like emission with significant temperature evolution, but the minimal information content of their almost pure-thermal spectra has limited physical constraints. Here we study the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (``Ansky''), which show absorption-like features evolving dramatically within eruptions and correlating strongly with continuum temperature and luminosity, further probing the conditions underlying the emission surface. The absorption features are well-described by dense ionized plasma of column density $N_{\rm H}\gtrsim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, blueshift $0.06\lesssim v/c \lesssim 0.4$, and either collisional or photoionization equilibrium. With high-resolution spectra, we also detect ionized blueshifted emission lines suggesting a nitrogen over-abundance of $21.7^{+18.5}_{-11.0}\times$ solar. We interpret our results with orbiter-disk collisions in an EMRI system, in which each impact drives a shock that locally heats the disk and expels X-ray emitting debris undergoing radiation pressure-driven homologous expansion. We explore an analytical toy model that links the rapid change in absorption lines to the evolution of the ionization parameter and the photosphere radius, and suggest that $\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ ejected per eruption with expansion velocities up to $v_{\rm max}\sim 0.15c$, can reproduce the absorption features. With these assumptions, we show a P Cygni profile in a spherical expansion geometry qualitatively matches the observed line profiles. Our work takes a first step towards extending existing physical models for QPEs to address their implications for spectral line formation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of extreme Quasi-Periodic Eruptions in a newly accreting massive black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rapid, recurring X-ray bursts from supermassive black holes, believed to result from interactions between accretion disks and surrounding matter. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously stable for two decades, exhibited an increase in optical brightness in December 2019, followed by persistent Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-like variability for 5 years, suggesting the activation of a $\sim$10$^6\;M_\odot$ black hole. From February 2024, X-ray emission has been detected, revealing extreme $\sim$4.5-day QPEs with the highest fluxes and amplitudes, longest time scales, largest integrated energies, and a $\sim$25-day super-period. Low-significance UV variations are reported for the first time in a QPE host, likely related to the long timescales and large radii from which the emission originates. This discovery broadens the possible formation channels for QPEs, suggesting they are not linked solely to tidal disruption events but more generally to newly formed accretion flows, which we are witnessing in real time in a turn-on AGN candidate.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and halo properties around cosmic filaments from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and the ELUCID simulation</title>

Abstract: Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) along with haloes from the dark matter only constrained ELUCID (Exploring the Local Universe with the reConstructed Initial Density field) simulation, we examine the properties of galaxies and haloes with respect to their distance to cosmic filaments, determined by the medial-axis thinning technique of the COsmic Web Skeleton (COWS) method. Our findings suggest that galaxies or subhaloes grow in mass as they approach these filaments. Galaxies exhibit a redder colour and diminished specific star formation rates as they approach these filaments. Additionally, older subhaloes tend to be more common near the central regions of these filaments. Elliptical galaxies are more frequently found than spiral galaxies in the central regions of the filaments. Lower-mass galaxies typically display reduced sizes in proximity to filaments, whereas higher-mass galaxies tend to exhibit increased sizes when close to filaments. Moreover, the concentration and spin of the haloes grow as they approach the filaments. These findings support the notion that the large-scale structure of the universe, characterized by cosmic web structures, plays a vital role in shaping galaxy and halo properties.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Compactness of High-Redshift Galaxies as a Tracer of Early-Stage Gas Infall, Bursty Star Formation, and Offset from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06336</link>

Abstract: The empirical anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (SFR), known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), is generally understood as an equilibrium state in the interplay between gas infall, enrichment, and gas removal in galaxies. NIRSpec spectroscopy has shown a $z&gt;3$ deviation from the local-universe calibration of the FMR, suggesting that these galaxies are potentially caught out of equilibrium. To investigate this, we measured the stellar population, nebular, and morphological properties of 427 galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;10$ based on their uniformly reduced NIRSpec prism spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. We find that a mass-size relation is already established at $4&lt;z&lt;10$, with a normalization anti-correlated with redshift. The size-redshift anti-correlation depends on stellar mass: while the size of $M_*&lt;10^8M_{\odot}$ galaxies strongly declines with redshift, $M_*&gt;10^9M_{\odot}$ galaxies exhibit negligible redshift evolution. Furthermore, we confirm the redshift evolution of the FMR: $z&gt;3$ galaxies appear metal deficient compared to what is expected for their stellar mass and SFR based on the local-universe FMR. This offset grows with redshift. We find that metal deficiency is correlated with compactness: the most compact galaxies (those most offset from the average mass-size relation) are the most unexpectedly-metal-poor by being the most offset from the local-universe FMR. We interpret this as a consequence of bursty star formation: compact galaxies exhibit elevated SFR surface densities, indicating that they are observed during burst episodes induced by fresh gas infall. While the accretion of metal-poor gas has reduced their gas-phase metallicity by diluting the ISM, they are observed prior to chemical yield release by newly formed massive stars. Simply, they are chemically out of equilibrium compared to the equilibrium state known as the FMR.</description>

      <title>The emergence of galactic thin and thick discs across cosmic history</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Present-day disc galaxies often exhibit distinct thin and thick discs. The formation mechanisms of the two discs and the timing of their onset remain open questions. To address these questions, we select edge-on galaxies from flagship JWST programs and investigate their disc structures in rest-frame, near-infrared bands. For the first time, we identify thick and thin discs at cosmological distances, dating back over 10 Gyr, and investigate their decomposed structural properties. We classify galaxies into those that require two (i.e. thin and thick) discs and those well fitted by a single disc. Disc radial sizes and vertical heights correlate strongly with the total galaxy mass and/or disc mass, independent of cosmic time. The structure of the thick disc resembles discs found in single-disc galaxies, suggesting that galaxies form a thick disc first, followed by the subsequent formation of an embedded thin disc. The transition from single to double discs occurred around 8 Gyr ago in high-mass galaxies ($10^{9.75} - 10^{11}M_\odot$), earlier than the transition which occurred 4 Gyr ago in low-mass galaxies ($10^{9.0} - 10^{9.75}M_\odot$), indicating sequential formation proceeds in a "downsizing" manner. Toomre $Q$-regulated disc formation explains the delayed thin disc formation in low-mass galaxies, leading to the observed anti-correlation between the thick-to-thin disc mass ratio and the total galaxy mass. Despite the dominant sequential formation, observations suggest that thick discs may continue to build up mass alongside their thin-disc counterparts.</description>

      <title>Are Models of Strong Gravitational Lensing by Clusters Converging or Diverging?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasingly large numbers of multiple images in cluster-scale gravitational lenses have allowed for tighter constraints on the mass distributions of these systems. Most lens models have progressed alongside this increase in image number. The general assumption is that these improvements would result in lens models converging to a common solution, suggesting that models are approaching the true mass distribution. To test whether or not this is occurring, we examine a sample of lens models of MACS J0416.1$-$2403 containing varying number of images as input. Splitting the sample into two bins (those including $&lt;150$ and $&gt;150$ images), we quantify the similarity of models in each bin using three comparison metrics, two of which are novel: Median Percent Difference, Frechet Distance, and Wasserstein Distance. In addition to quantifying similarity, the Frechet distance metric seems to also be an indicator of the mass sheet degeneracy. Each metric indicates that models with a greater number of input images are no more similar between one another than models with fewer input images. This suggests that lens models are neither converging nor diverging to a common solution for this system, regardless of method. With this result, we suggest that future models more carefully investigate lensing degeneracies and anomalous mass clumps (mass features significantly displaced from baryonic counterparts) to rigorously evaluate their model's validity. We also recommend further study into alternative, underutilized lens model priors (e.g. flux ratios) as an additional input constraint to image positions in hopes of breaking existing degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Non-linear magnetic buoyancy instability and galactic dynamos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic buoyancy (MBI) and Parker instabilities are strong, generic instabilities expected to occur in most astrophysical systems with sufficiently strong magnetic fields. In galactic and accretion discs, large-scale magnetic fields are thought to arise from mean-field dynamo action, particularly the $\alpha^2\Omega$-dynamo. Using non-ideal MHD equations, we model a section of the galactic disc where the large-scale magnetic field is generated by an imposed $\alpha$-effect and differential rotation. We extend our previous study of the interplay between magnetic buoyancy and the mean-field dynamo by incorporating differential rotation, which enhances the dynamo, and cosmic rays, which amplify magnetic buoyancy.We construct a simple 1D model which replicates all significant features of the 3D simulations. Simulations confirm that magnetic buoyancy can lead to oscillatory magnetic fields and reveal that it can change the magnetic field parity between quadrupolar and dipolar states. Differential rotation facilitates this switch in parity, suggesting that the large-scale magnetic field can adopt a dipolar parity within a few kiloparsecs of the galactic centre. In contrast, quadrupolar parity may remain predominant in the outer parts of a galactic disc. Cosmic rays accelerate both the dynamo and the MBI, supporting oscillatory non-linear states and a spatial magnetic field structure similar to the alternating magnetic field directions observed in {the haloes of} some edge-on galaxies.</description>

      <title>Using simulation based inference on tidally perturbed dwarf galaxies: the dynamics of NGC205</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to performing precision inference on tidally perturbed dwarf galaxies. We use a Bayesian inference framework of implicit likelihood inference, previously applied mainly in the field of cosmology, based on forward simulation, data compression, and likelihood emulation with neural density estimators. We consider the case of NGC205, a satellite of M31. NGC205 exhibits an S-shape in the mean line-of-sight velocity along its semi-major spatial axis, suggestive of tidal perturbation. We demonstrate that this velocity profile can be qualitatively reproduced even if NGC205 was in a spherically symmetric and isotropic state before its most recent pericenter passage. We apply our inference method to mock data and show that the precise shape of a perturbed satellite's sky-projected internal velocity field can be highly informative of both its orbit and total mass density profile, even in the absence of proper motion information. For the actual NGC205, our method is hampered because the available data only covers a line along its semi-major axis, rather than the full sky-projected field. This shortcoming could be addressed with another round of observations.</description>

      <title>Gas excitation in galaxies and active galactic nuclei with He II{\lambda}4686 and X-ray emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of He II emission in galaxies remains a debated topic, requiring ionizing photons with energies exceeding 54 eV. While massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars, have been considered potential sources, their UV flux often fails to fully explain the observed He II emission. Recent studies suggest that X-ray binaries (XRBs) might contribute significantly to this ionization. We explore the relationship between X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ emission in a statistically significant sample of galaxies, investigating whether X-ray sources, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and XRBs, serve as the primary mechanism for He II ionization across different galactic environments. We cross-matched a sample of known well-detected He II galaxies with the Chandra Source Catalog, yielding 165 galaxies with X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ detections. The sources were classified into star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and AGNs based on the BPT diagram and a classification scheme defined for He II galaxies. We find a strong, linear correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity across AGNs and SFGs spanning over seven orders of magnitude. AGNs generally exhibit higher He II/H$\beta$ flux ratios, stronger extinction, and harder X-ray spectra. The O32 ratio of SFGs is tightly correlated with the H$\beta$ equivalent width ($\rm EW_{H\beta}$) but not with the He II/H$\beta$ ratio, suggesting a different excitation mechanism. We derive an O32--$\rm EW_{H\beta}$ line above which only AGNs of our sample reside. The tight correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity supports X-rays as the primary driver of He II excitation. While AGNs have one common ionization source, the central black hole, in SFGs low-energy species are mainly excited by UV emission related to star-forming activity, however, high-energy species like He II require the presence of XRBs.</description>

Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster and is likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. In this paper, we analyze $\omega$ Cen's kinematics using data from oMEGACat, a comprehensive catalog of $\omega$ Cen's central regions, including 1.4 million proper motion measurements and 300,000 spectroscopic radial velocities. Our velocity dispersion profiles and kinematic maps are consistent with previous work but improve on their resolution, precision, and spatial coverage. The cluster's 3D dispersion is isotropic in the core, with increasing radial anisotropy at larger radii. The 2D kinematic maps show an elongation of the velocity dispersion field comparable to the flattening observed photometrically. We find good agreement between proper motions and line-of-sight velocity dispersion and measure a kinematic distance of 5494$\pm$61 pc, the most precise kinematic distance to $\omega$ Cen available. The subset of data with precise metallicity measurements shows no correlation between metallicity and kinematics, supporting the picture of well-mixed stellar populations within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. Finally, we study the degree of energy equipartition using a large range of stellar masses. We find partial energy equipartition in the center that decreases towards large radii. The spatial dependence of the radial energy equipartition is stronger than the tangential energy equipartition. Our kinematic observations can serve as a new reference for future dynamical modeling efforts that will help to further disentangle the complex mass distribution within $\omega$ Cen.</description>

Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 $\mu$m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.95 $\pm$ 0.15 cm s$^{-2}$. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 $\mu$m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast $C$-type shocks ($\geq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), with high pre-shock density ($\geq$ $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where $B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,\mu\textrm{G}$) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH$^{+}$ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.</description>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited their large-scale analysis to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, greatly enhancing the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand the parameter space they will occupy. In this work, we construct synthetic populations of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the Sonora Bobcat, SM08, and Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models. From the populations, we explore the space densities and median ages by spectral type. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.
  Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.
  The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of "escaper" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.</description>
