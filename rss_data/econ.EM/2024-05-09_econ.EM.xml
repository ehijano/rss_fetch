      <title>Sequential Validation of Treatment Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the martingale construction of Luedtke and van der Laan (2016) to develop tests for the presence of treatment heterogeneity. The resulting sequential validation approach can be instantiated using various validation metrics, such as BLPs, GATES, QINI curves, etc., and provides an alternative to cross-validation-like cross-fold application of these metrics.</description>

      <title>Advancing Distribution Decomposition Methods Beyond Common Supports: Applications to Racial Wealth Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I generalize state-of-the-art approaches that decompose differences in the distribution of a variable of interest between two groups into a portion explained by covariates and a residual portion. The method that I propose relaxes the overlapping supports assumption, allowing the groups being compared to not necessarily share exactly the same covariate support. I illustrate my method revisiting the black-white wealth gap in the U.S. as a function of labor income and other variables. Traditionally used decomposition methods would trim (or assign zero weight to) observations that lie outside the common covariate support region. On the other hand, by allowing all observations to contribute to the existing wealth gap, I find that otherwise trimmed observations contribute from 3% to 19% to the overall wealth gap, at different portions of the wealth distribution.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Identification of Revenue Production Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Production functions are potentially misspecified when revenue is used as a proxy for output. I formalize and strengthen this common knowledge by showing that neither the production function nor Hicks-neutral productivity can be identified with such a revenue proxy. This result obtains when relaxing the standard assumptions used in the literature to allow for imperfect competition. It holds for a large class of production functions, including all commonly used parametric forms. Among the prevalent approaches to address this issue, only those that impose assumptions on the underlying demand system can possibly identify the production function.</description>

      <title>Estimating Fiscal Multipliers by Combining Statistical Identification with Potentially Endogenous Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13066v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different proxy variables used in fiscal policy SVARs lead to contradicting conclusions regarding the size of fiscal multipliers. We show that the conflicting results are due to violations of the exogeneity assumptions, i.e. the commonly used proxies are endogenously related to the structural shocks. We propose a novel approach to include proxy variables into a Bayesian non-Gaussian SVAR, tailored to accommodate for potentially endogenous proxy variables. Using our model, we show that increasing government spending is a more effective tool to stimulate the economy than reducing taxes.</description>

      <title>Negative Control Falsification Tests for Instrumental Variable Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop theoretical foundations for widely used falsification tests for instrumental variable (IV) designs. We characterize these tests as conditional independence tests between negative control variables - proxies for potential threats - and either the IV or the outcome. We find that conventional applications of these falsification tests would flag problems in exogenous IV designs, and propose simple solutions to avoid this. We also propose new falsification tests that incorporate new types of negative control variables or alternative statistical tests. Finally, we illustrate that under stronger assumptions, negative control variables can also be used for bias correction.</description>

      <title>Inference for Regression with Variables Generated from Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading strategy for analyzing unstructured data uses two steps. First, latent variables of economic interest are estimated with an upstream information retrieval model. Second, the estimates are treated as "data" in a downstream econometric model. We establish theoretical arguments for why this two-step strategy leads to biased inference in empirically plausible settings. More constructively, we propose a one-step strategy for valid inference that uses the upstream and downstream models jointly. The one-step strategy (i) substantially reduces bias in simulations; (ii) has quantitatively important effects in a leading application using CEO time-use data; and (iii) can be readily adapted by applied researchers.</description>
