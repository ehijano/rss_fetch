      <title>Laser-cluster interaction in an external magnetic field: the effect of laser polarization</title>

Abstract: Collisionless absorption of laser energy by an electron via laser-cluster interaction in an ambient magnetic field ($B_0$) has recently renewed interest. %due to high levels of absorption. Previously, using a rigid sphere model (RSM) and an extensive particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation with linearly polarized (LP) laser light, we have shown that an auxiliary field $B_0$ in a transverse direction to the laser polarization significantly enhances the laser absorption [Scientific Reports {\bf 12}, 11256 (2022)]. In this LP case, the average energy ($\mathcal{E}_A$) of an electron rises near $30-70$ times of its ponderomotive energy ($U_p$). The two-stage laser absorption by cluster electrons has been attributed via anharmonic resonance (AHR) followed by electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) satisfying the improved phase-matching and frequency-matching conditions simultaneously. %Again, we report the narrow cone-like propagation of these %energetic electron bunches as a weakly relativistic electron beam with an %angular spread $\Delta\theta&lt;5^{\circ}$. %Also, we highlight the effect of bigger cluster sizes on the energy and %angular spread of these electrons. In the present work, we study the effect of circularly polarized (CP) laser fields on the cluster-electron dynamics considering left/right circular polarizations with an ambient $B_0$. %, energy distribution, and..</description>

      <title>Material Barriers to the Diffusion of the Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has identified objective (frame-indifferent) material barriers that inhibit the transport of dynamically active vectorial quantities (such as linear momentum, angular momentum and vorticity) in Navier-Stokes flows. In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a similar setting arises: the magnetic field vector impacts the evolution of the velocity field through the Lorentz force and hence is a dynamically active vector field. Here, we extend the theory of active material barriers from Navier-Stokes flows to MHD flows in order to locate frame-indifferent barriers to the diffusive transport of the magnetic field in turbulent two-dimensional and three-dimensional MHD flows. From this approach we obtain an algorithm for the automated extraction of such barriers from MHD turbulence data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Gradient Estimation in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying turbulence, it is often desirable to be able to estimate the local spatial gradient of a vector quantity using in situ measurements from a small number of irregularly spaced points. While previous studies have focused on the accuracy of these methods as the number of measurement points varies, we focus on the accuracy of gradient estimations as a function of shape of the measurement point configuration. We find that for well-shaped configurations that are of correct relative size, we can very accurately estimate the local spatial gradient using only four points.</description>

      <title>Periodic Korteweg-de Vries soliton potentials generate magnetic field strength with excellent quasisymmetry</title>

Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) is a hidden symmetry of the magnetic field strength, $B$, that confines charged particles effectively in a three-dimensional toroidal plasma equilibrium. Here, we show that QS has a deep connection to the underlying symmetry that makes solitons possible. Our approach uncovers a hidden lower dimensionality of $B$ on a magnetic flux surface, which could make stellarator optimization schemes significantly more efficient. Recent numerical breakthroughs have yielded configurations with excellent volumetric QS and surprisingly low magnetic shear. Our approach elucidates why the magnetic shear is low in these configurations. Furthermore, we deduce an upper bound on the maximum toroidal volume that can be quasisymmetric and verify it for the Landreman-Paul precise quasiaxisymmetric (QA) stellarator configuration. In the neighborhood of the outermost surface, we show that the B approaches the form of the 1-soliton reflectionless potential. We present three independent approaches to demonstrate that quasisymmetric $B$ is described by well-known integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The first approach is weakly nonlinear multiscale perturbation theory, which highlights the crucial role that magnetic shear plays in QS. We show that the overdetermined problem of finding quasisymmetric vacuum fields admits solutions for which the rotational transform is not free but highly constrained. We obtain the KdV equation (and, more specifically, Gardner's equation for certain choices of parameters). Our second approach is non-perturbative and based on ensuring single-valuedness of $B$, which directly leads to its Painlev\'e property shared by the KdV equation. Our third approach uses machine learning, trained on a large dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators. We robustly recover the KdV (and Gardner's) equation from the data.</description>

      <title>Investigation of positive streamers in CO$_2$: experiments and 3D particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of positive streamers in CO$_2$ through 3D particle-in-cell simulations, which are qualitatively compared against experimental results at 50\,mbar. The experiments show that CO$_2$ streamers are much more stochastic than air streamers at the same applied voltage, indicating that few electrons are available in front of the streamer head. In the simulations, we include a photoionization model for CO$_2$. The computational results show that even a small amount of photoionization can sustain positive streamer propagation, but this requires a higher electric field than in air. We discuss the uncertainties in CO$_2$ photoionization and provide an estimate for the quenching pressure, which is based on the radiative lifetime of emitting states and the collision frequency of the gas. Furthermore, a criterion for self-sustained streamer growth in CO$_2$ is presented and compared against simulation results.</description>

      <title>Influence of collisions on trapped-electron modes in tokamaks and low-shear stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of collisions on the growth rate of trapped-electron modes (TEMs) in core plasmas is assessed through both analytical linear gyrokinetics and linear gyrokinetic simulations. Both methods are applied to the magnetic geometry of the DIII-D tokamak, as well as the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarators, in the absence of temperature gradients. Here we analytically investigate the influence of collisions on the TEM eigenmode frequency by a perturbative approach in the response of trapped particles to the mode, using an energy-dependent Krook operator to model collisions. Although the resulting growth rates exceed perturbative thresholds, they reveal important qualitative dependencies: a geometry-dependent stabilization rate occurs for all wavenumbers at high collisionality, while at low collisionality, a geometry-sensitive mixture of collisionless, resonantly driven, and collisionally destabilized modes is found. Additionally, linear gyrokinetic simulations have been performed with a rigorous pitch-angle scattering operator for the same geometries. In the case of DIII-D and large wavenumber modes in HSX, the trends predicted by analytical theory are reproduced. Dissimilarities are, however, obtained in W7-X geometry and for low wavenumber modes in HSX, which are shown to be due to a collision-induced transition to the Universal Instability as the dominant instability at marginal collisionality.</description>

      <title>Exploring Astrophysically-Relevant Superadiabaticity Driven by Non-Resonant Heating in a Laboratory Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polytropic index of electrons in a magnetized plasma is experimentally investigated in the presence of external heating and anisotropic work done on the system by the magnetic field, incorporating the effective dimensionality in an anisotropic plasma. The measurements clearly demonstrate localized regions of superadiabatic electrons due to particle acceleration and energization through non-resonant betatron and Fermi heating processes. In regions where wave-induced heating through electron cyclotron resonance dominates, the plasma electrons behave adiabatically. The realization of superadiabaticity is universal where heating dominates the work done and has broader implications for energy exchange processes in astrophysically-relevant plasmas.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the parameter space of quasisymmetric stellarator vacuum fields through adjoint optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimising stellarators for quasisymmetry leads to strongly reduced collisional transport and energetic particle losses compared to unoptimised configurations. Though stellarators with precise quasisymmetry have been obtained in the past, it remains unclear how broad the parameter space is where good quasisymmetry may be achieved. We study the range of aspect ratio and rotational transform values for which stellarators with excellent quasisymmetry on the boundary can be obtained. A large number of Fourier harmonics is included in the boundary representation, which is made computationally tractable by the use of adjoint methods to enable fast gradient-based optimisation, and by the direct optimisation of vacuum magnetic fields, which converge more robustly compared to solutions from magnetohydrostatics. Several novel configurations are presented, including stellarators with record levels of quasisymmetry on a surface; three field period quasiaxisymmetric stellarators with substantial magnetic shear, and compact quasisymmetric stellarators at low aspect ratios similar to tokamaks.</description>
