      <title>GeoDirDock: Guiding Docking Along Geodesic Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces GeoDirDock (GDD), a novel approach to molecular docking that enhances the accuracy and physical plausibility of ligand docking predictions. GDD guides the denoising process of a diffusion model along geodesic paths within multiple spaces representing translational, rotational, and torsional degrees of freedom. Our method leverages expert knowledge to direct the generative modeling process, specifically targeting desired protein-ligand interaction regions. We demonstrate that GDD significantly outperforms existing blind docking methods in terms of RMSD accuracy and physicochemical pose realism. Our results indicate that incorporating domain expertise into the diffusion process leads to more biologically relevant docking predictions. Additionally, we explore the potential of GDD for lead optimization in drug discovery through angle transfer in maximal common substructure (MCS) docking, showcasing its capability to predict ligand orientations for chemically similar compounds accurately.</description>

      <title>Direct electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide thin film for aptamer-based selective and highly sensitive detection of Matrix metalloproteinase 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and low-cost biosensing solutions are suitable for point-of-care applications aiming to overcome the gap between scientific concepts and technological production. To compete with sensitivity and selectivity of golden standards, such as liquid chromatography, the functionalization of biosensors is continuously optimized to enhance the signal and improve their performance, often leading to complex chemical assay development. In this research, the efforts are made on optimizing the methodology for electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide to produce thin film-modified gold electrodes. Under the employed specific conditions, 20 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) are shown to be optimal for superior electrical activation of graphene oxide into electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO). This platform is further used to develop a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) biosensor, where specific anti-MMP2 aptamers are utilized as a biorecognition element. MMP-2 is a protein which is typically overexpressed in tumor tissues, with important roles in tumor invasion, metastasis as well as in tumor angiogenesis. Based on impedimetric measurements, we were able to detect as low as 3.32 pg/mL of MMP-2 in PBS with a dynamic range of 10 pg/mL - 10 ng/mL. Besides high specificity, ERGO-based aptasensor showed a potential of reuse due to demonstrated successful signal restoration after experimental detection of MMP-2.</description>
