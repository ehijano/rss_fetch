      <title>Evolving beyond collapse: An adaptive particle batch smoother for cryospheric data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new adaptive particle-based data assimilation scheme for cryospheric applications that leverages promising developments in importance sampling. The proposed approach seeks to combine some of the advantages of two widely used classes of schemes: particle methods and iterative ensemble Kalman methods. Specifically, it extends the PBS that is commonly used in cryospheric data assimilation, with the AMIS algorithm. This adaptive formulation transforms the PBS into an iterative scheme with improved resilience against ensemble collapse and the ability to implement early-stopping strategies. As such, computational cost is automatically adapted to the complexity of the problem at hand, even down to the grid-cell and water year level in distributed multiyear simulations. In homage to the schemes that it builds on, we coin this new algorithm the Adaptive Particle Batch Smoother (AdaPBS) and we test it across a range of scenarios. First, we conducted an intercomparison of some of the most commonly used cryospheric data assimilation algorithms using MCMC simulation as a costly gold-standard benchmark in a simplified temperature index model assimilating snow depth observations. We further evaluated AdaPBS by assimilating snow depth observations from the ESMSnowMIP project at 6 different sites spanning 3 continents, using an ensemble of simulations generated with the more complex FSM2. Our results demonstrate that AdaPBS is a robust and reliable tool, outperforming or at least matching the performance of other commonly used algorithms and successfully handling complex cases with dense observational datasets. All experiments were carried out using the open-source MuSA toolbox, which now includes AdaPBS and MCMC among the growing list of available cryospheric data assimilation methods.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed deep learning links geodetic data and fault friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault slip modeling, based on laboratory-derived friction laws, has significantly enhanced our understanding of fault mechanics. Agreement between model predictions and observations supports the hypothesis that observed slip diversity, including fast earthquakes and slow transient slips (Slow Slip Events; SSEs), originates from frictional heterogeneity. However, quantitative assessments of frictional heterogeneity from geodetic observations while fully incorporating fault mechanics are lacking due to the difficulties of high-dimensional optimization. In this study, we aim to address this gap using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to link frictional heterogeneity with geodetic observations. PINNs employ a neural network to represent the spatially variable frictional properties, making their estimation feasible. Targeting the 2010 Bungo SSE in southwest Japan, our estimation reveals heterogeneous friction coinciding with localized SSE nucleation in southwest Shikoku, and subsequent westward propagation. The calculated fault slip of SSE successfully reproduces the spatio-temporal pattern of observed surface displacements. This PINN-based inversion provides a mechanically consistent fault slip model validated through quantitative comparison with observations. Furthermore, we predict the future fault slip evolution, demonstrating the importance of assimilating observations spanning multiple SSE cycles. Our results demonstrate the potential of PINN for advancing understanding of fault mechanics and enabling physics-based fault slip forecasting.</description>

      <title>SourceNet: Interpretable Sim-to-Real Inference on Variable-Geometry Sensor Arrays for Earthquake Source Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring high-dimensional physical states from sparse, ad-hoc sensor arrays is a fundamental challenge across AI for Science, yet standard architectures like CNNs and DeepSets struggle to capture the irregular geometries and relational physics inherent to domains like seismology. To address this, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that bridges the profound Sim-to-Real gap via Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR), a protocol that randomizes governing physical dynamics to enforce invariance to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,500 real-world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and real-time capability compared to classical solvers. Beyond prediction, interpretability analysis reveals that the model shows scientific-agent-like features: it autonomously discovers geometric information bottlenecks and learns an attention policy that prioritizes sparse sensor placements, effectively recovering principles of optimal experimental design from data alone.</description>
