      <title>Computational Modeling and Analysis of the Coupled Aero Structural Dynamics in Bat Inspired Wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a novel computational modeling framework to perform high-fidelity direct numerical simulations of aero-structural interactions in bat-inspired membrane wings. The wing of a bat consists of an elastic membrane supported by a highly articulated skeleton, enabling localized control over wing movement and deformation during flight. By modeling these complex deformations, along with realistic wing movements and interactions with the surrounding airflow, we expect to gain new insights into the performance of these unique wings. Our model achieves a high degree of realism by incorporating experimental measurements of the skeleton's joint movements to guide the fluid-structure interaction simulations. The simulations reveal that different segments of the wing undergo distinct aeroelastic deformations, impacting flow dynamics and aerodynamic loads. Specifically, the simulations show significant variations in the effectiveness of the wing in generating lift, drag, and thrust forces across different segments and regions of the wing. We employ a force partitioning method to analyze the causality of pressure loads over the wing, demonstrating that vortex-induced pressure forces are dominant while added mass contributions to aerodynamic loads are minimal. This approach also elucidates the role of various flow structures in shaping pressure distributions. Finally, we compare the fully articulated, flexible bat wing to equivalent stiff wings derived from the same kinematics, demonstrating the critical impact of wing articulation and deformation on aerodynamic efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Separating Flow Behind a Cylinder: Insights from the Principle of Minimum Pressure Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the separating flow over a circular cylinder with two objectives: (i) to demonstrate the validity of the condition of matching curvature, and (ii) to obtain a reasonable estimate of the separation angle in the subcritical regime (Re=10^4-10^5) without explicitly modeling the boundary layer. First, we study Roshko's free streamline model (1954); it is an ideal flow model with sheets of discontinuities that represent the separating shear layers in the near wake region. The model fails to predict the correct separation angle over a cylinder. Roshko attributed this discrepancy to the condition of matching curvature, which asserts that the curvature of the separating streamline at the separation point must match that of the cylinder. We show that such a condition is legitimate and is not the real culprit for the failure of Roshko's model in predicting separation. Second, we employ the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG), which asserts that, an incompressible flow evolves by minimizing the total magnitude of the pressure gradient over the domain. Encouraged by the fact that the flow characteristics in the range Re=10^4-10^5 are fairly independent of Re, we aim to predict the separation angle in this regime without modeling the boundary layer -- a task that may seem impossible, though anticipated by Prandtl in his seminal paper (Prandtl 1904). Over the family of kinematically-admissible, equilibrium flows, we utilize the PMPG to single out the separating flow with the minimum pressure gradient cost. Interestingly, the obtained separation angles match experimental measurements over the regime Re=10^4-10^5.</description>

      <title>Optimally time-dependent modes of vortex gust-airfoil interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the optimally time-dependent (OTD) orthogonal modes about a time-varying flow generated by a strong gust vortex impacting a NACA 0012 airfoil. This OTD analysis reveals the amplification characteristics of perturbations about the unsteady base flow and their amplified spatiotemporal structures that evolve over time. We consider four time-varying laminar base flows in which a vortex with a strength corresponding to the gust ratio $G$ of $\{-1,-0.5,0.5,1\}$ impinges on the leading edge of the airfoil at an angle of attack of $12^\circ$. In these cases, the impingement of the strong gust vortex causes massive separation and the generation of large-scale vortices around the airfoil within two convective time units. The highly unsteady nature of these vortex-airfoil interactions necessitates an advanced analytical technique capable of capturing the transient perturbation dynamics. For each of the considered gust ratios, the OTD analysis identifies the most amplified region to perturbations, the location of which changes as the wake evolves differently. For interactions between a moderate positive vortex gust ($G=0.5$) and the airfoil, the area where perturbations are amplified transitions from the leading-edge vortex sheet to the forming leading-edge vortex. Later, this most amplified structure becomes supported in the airfoil wake directly behind the trailing edge. In contrast, a strong vortex gust ($G=\pm 1$) encountered by the airfoil shows the most amplified OTD mode to appear around the core of the shed vortices. This study provides an analysis technique and fundamental insights into the broader family of unsteady aerodynamic problems.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Resolving Integral Simulations for Wall-Bounded Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical fidelity of turbulence models can significantly benefit from a partial resolution of fluctuations, but doing so often comes with a significant increase in computational cost. To explore this trade-off in the context of wall-bounded flows, this paper introduces a framework for Turbulence-Resolving Integral Simulations (TRIS) with the goal of efficiently resolving the largest motions using two-dimensional fields defined by instantaneous wall-normal integration of velocity and pressure. Self-sustaining turbulence with qualitatively realistic large-scale structures is demonstrated for TRIS on an open-channel (half-channel) flow using moment-of-momentum integral equations derived from Navier-Stokes with relatively simple closure approximations. Evidence from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) suggests that such an approach can resolve 35-40% of the Reynolds shear stress at arbitrarily high Reynolds number. The current implementation of TRIS can match this resolution while simulating one flow through time in ~1 minute on a single processor, even for very large Reynolds number. The present proof-of-concept TRIS results shown here rely on parameter tuning, and some quantitative differences with DNS spectra are observed, motivating ongoing and future efforts towards physics-based closures as well as extension to more general flow configurations such as boundary layers on immersed objects.</description>

      <title>The onset of nonpenetrative convection in a suddenly cooled layer of fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02134v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditions for the onset of nonpenetrative convection in a horizontal Boussinesq fluid layer subject to a step change in temperature are studied using propagation theory. A wide range of Prandtl numbers and two different kinematic boundary conditions are considered. It is shown that for high Rayleigh numbers, critical conditions for the onset of convective motion reproduce exactly those for the unsteady Rayleigh-B\'enard instability. Present results extend those of previous research and show a tendency of the rigid-rigid and free-rigid critical curves to converge for low Prandtl numbers. Comparison between present and previously reported results on critical conditions for the onset of instabilities and onset time using different methods yields good agreement on a middle to high Prandtl number range. A ratio of 10 between experimentally measured and theoretically predicted onset times is suggested for stress-free bounded systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition using sub-Nyquist rate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal decomposition methods are important for characterizing the low-dimensional dynamics of complex systems, including turbulent flows. Different methods have varying data requirements and produce modes with different properties. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) produces orthogonal, energy-ranked spatial modes at discrete temporal frequencies for statistically stationary flows. However, SPOD requires long stretches of sequential, uniformly sampled, time-resolved data. These data requirements limit SPOD's use in experimental settings where the maximum capture rate of a camera is often slower than the Nyquist sampling rate required to resolve the highest turbulent frequencies. However, if two PIV systems operate in tandem, pairs of data can be acquired that are arbitrarily close in time. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) uses this pairwise data to resolve frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency associated with the small time step within a pair. However, these modes do not form an orthonormal basis and have no set ranking. The present work attempts to compute SPOD modes from pairwise data with a small time step but with large gaps between pairs. We use DMD on pairwise data to estimate segment-wise, uniformly sampled series that can then be used to estimate the SPOD modes, intending to resolve frequencies between the gap and pair Nyquist limits. The method is tested on numerically obtained data of the linearized complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, as well as a Mach 0.4 isothermal turbulent jet. For the jet, pairwise SPOD can accurately de-alias the SPOD spectrum and estimate mode shapes at frequencies up to St = 1.0 while using over 90% less data.</description>

      <title>Tertiary EOR-like microfluidic experiments: influence of viscosity ratio on oil clusters mobilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the pore-scale dynamics of immiscible two-phase flow in porous media is crucial 9 for optimizing EOR strategies. In this work, we investigate the mobilization dynamics of oil clusters by 10 means of microfluidic devices that allow pore scale direct characterization of flow in water-wet chips. We varied both flow rates during waterflooding and the viscosity ratio by injecting Glycerol/water mixtures of various compositions right after the waterflooding period. During waterflooding, the flow rate has only a limited impact on residual oil. With a subsequent injection of a Glycerol/water mixture, the oil recovery is significantly enhanced. To better understand the recovery mechanisms, oil clusters were categorized into droplets, blobs and ganglia. Increasing the viscosity of the injected mixture resulted in only a slight reduction in the number of ganglia but significantly decreased their total volume, thus reducing overall oil saturation. This is due to ganglia breakup into smaller ganglia, blobs and droplets that are subsequently mobilized and transported away, while remaining parts of original ganglia still remain trapped. As long as droplets and blobs are considered, their number is seen to only weakly change by the increase of mixture viscosity and even their number may temporarily increase as they result from ganglia rupture. So, the process can be separated in two main steps: ganglia breakage that feed the medium in blobs and droplets and a second step where such moving oil entities are transported. The characteristic time for oil transport is believed to be longer than that required for ganglia breakage.</description>

      <title>Unsteady load alleviation on highly flexible bio-inspired wings in longitudinally oscillating freestreams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the aerodynamic behavior of a highly flexible NACA 0012 aerofoil, drawing inspiration from avian feathers to handle a gust. We first examined unsteady flow on a rigid wing both experimentally and numerically and then explored the implications of introducing wing flexibility purely numerically. Our findings underscore the potential of composite materials in alleviating the oscillating aerodynamic forces on a wing under a streamwise gust. This behavior is attributed to its capacity to destabilize the laminar separation bubble, fostering a more stable turbulent boundary layer. While direct avian evidence remains limited, it is postulated that in nature, such mechanisms could mitigate undesired wing flapping, optimizing energy consumption in perturbed environments.</description>

      <title>Wave or Physics-Appropriate Multidimensional Upwinding Approach for Compressible Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces multidimensional algorithms for simulating multiphase flows, leveraging the wave structure of the Euler equations in characteristic space and the physical properties of variables in physical space. The algorithm applies different reconstruction schemes to acoustic, vorticity, and entropy waves in characteristic space to enhance accuracy and minimize numerical artifacts. In characteristic space, upwind schemes are used for acoustic waves, central schemes for vorticity and entropy waves, and Tangent of Hyper-bola for INterface Capturing (THINC) reconstruction for material interfaces and contact discontinuities (a subset of entropy waves). This approach prevents spurious vortices in periodic shear layers, accurately captures vortical structures in gas-gas and gas-liquid interactions, and improves the accuracy of shock-entropy wave interactions. In physical space, phasic densities are computed using THINC in regions of contact discontinuities and material interfaces, while tangential velocities are calculated with central schemes to improve vortical structures. An adaptive reconstruction technique is also introduced to mitigate oscillations near shocks, which arise from primitive variable reconstruction, by combining primitive and characteristic variable reconstructions with the liquid phase being identified using the stiffened gas parameter. The proposed multidimensional upwinding approach outperforms traditional schemes, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing physical phenomena, reducing numerical artifacts, and better matching experimental results across complex test cases.</description>

      <title>Stationary states of forced two-phase turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform numerical simulations of forced two-phase isotropic turbulence to study the stationary states of a two-phase mixture. We first formulate three different approaches to force a two-phase turbulent flow that maintains a constant (a) mixture kinetic energy, (b) mixture kinetic energy + surface energy, and (c) individual phase kinetic energy, and study their effect on the final stationary state of the system. We show that forcing the two-phase system eliminates the arbitrariness associated with the initialization of the second phase in two-phase turbulence simulations. Next, we study the global statistics of the two-phase mixture in the stationary state for varying density ratios ($10^{-3}$ to $10^3$) and viscosity ratios ($10^{-3}$ to $10^3$), void fraction (dilute to dense regimes), and Weber numbers (breakup and non-breakup regimes). We utilize a spatial filtering approach, that is applicable for the general case of incompressible/compressible two-phase flows, to compute the energy spectra of each of the phases and study the turbulent kinetic energy distribution across scales. We find that the interface behaves as a soft wall, inhibiting the accommodation of eddies inside the dispersed phase. Finally, we show that bubbles and drops exhibit different turbulent characteristics for the same global conditions of the carrier phase, with bubbles exhibiting higher turbulent intensities inside them and droplets behaving ballistically, similar to solid particles. This study acts as a foundational work on stationary two-phase turbulence, which can be used for further analysis and the development of subgrid-scale models for larger-scale simulations of two-phase turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Foam stabilization in salt solutions : the role of capillary drainage and Marangoni stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Shear-Thinning Rheology on the Dynamics and Pressure Distribution of a Single Rigid Ellipsoidal Particle in Viscous Fluid Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the behavior of a single rigid ellipsoidal particle suspended in homogenous viscous flow with a power-law Generalized Newtonian Fluid (GNF) rheology using a custom-built finite element analysis (FEA) simulation. The combined effects of the shear-thinning fluid rheology, the particle aspect ratio, the initial particle orientation and the shear-extensional rate factor in various homogenous flow regimes on the particle's dynamics and surface pressure evolution are investigated. The shear-thinning fluid behavior was found to modify the particle's trajectory and alter the particle's kinematic response. Moreover, the pressure distribution over the particle's surface is significantly reduced by the shear-thinning fluid rheology. The FEA model is validated by comparing results of the Newtonian case with results obtained from the well-known Jefferys analytical model. Furthermore, Jefferys model is extended to define the particle's trajectory in a special class of homogenous Newtonian flows with combined extension and shear rate components typically found in axisymmetric nozzle flow contractions. The findings provide an improved understanding of key transport phenomenon related to physical processes involving fluid-structure interaction (FSI) such as that which occurs within the flow-field developed during material extrusion-deposition additive manufacturing of fiber reinforced polymeric composites. These results provide insight into important microstructural formations within the print beads.</description>

      <title>Viscotaxis of chiral microswimmer in viscosity gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microswimmers display an intriguing ability to navigate through fluids with spatially varying viscosity, a behavior known as viscotaxis, which plays a crucial role in guiding their motion. In this study, we reveal that the orientation dynamics of chiral squirmers in fluids with uniform viscosity gradients can be elegantly captured using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations, originally developed for spin systems. Remarkably, we discover that chiral swimmers demonstrate negative viscotaxis, tracing spiral trajectories as they move. Specifically, a chiral squirmer with a misaligned source dipole and rotlet dipole exhibits a steady-state spiral motion-a stark contrast to the linear behavior observed when the dipoles are aligned. This work provides fresh insights into the intricate interplay between microswimmer dynamics and fluid properties.</description>

Abstract: The study of gas bubble dynamics in liquids is justified by the numerous applications and natural phenomena where this two-phase flow is encountered. Gas bubbles move as forces are applied to them; their dynamics are full of nuances that need to be addressed carefully. Since the mass of gas bubbles is practically negligible, in comparison to that of the surrounding liquid, their reaction to the fluid is controlled by the added mass acceleration and is thus impacted by all the forces arising from the fluid action. Furthermore, since their surface can be deformed by the same forces acting on them, their shape may change leading to changes in their resistance to move, the drag force, and therefore affecting their speed and their interaction with the surrounding flow which is often turbulent. The liquid rheology, as well as its surfactant content can also affect the bubble shape and motion as well. Understanding these issues, in addition to the effect of interactions with other bubbles, walls, and non-uniform flows, provides sufficient elements to model and predict bubble behavior through the solution of dynamic equations. In this review, we cover the key aspects of non-condensable gas bubble dynamics. We survey classical references on the subject and provide an overview of the main findings in the past 20 years. We conclude with a scope and suggestions for future research directions, with special attention to the dynamics of bubble in turbulence, in non-Newtonian fluid and/or in the presence of electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Super-fast bullet bubbles transported in a pressure-driven cylindrical flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When transported by a pressure driven flow in a cylindrical pipe, bubbles may exhibit very fast velocities. In this paper, we show that, when the bubbles are largely deformable, that is, at large capillary numbers Ca, the velocity of the bubble can be larger than the maximal velocity of the flow that transports them. We call this regime "super-fast". However, the situation changes when inertia comes at play for increasing Reynolds numbers Re, and the relative velocity of the bubble drops for sufficiently large Laplace number, defined as La = Re/Ca. In this article, we uncover the conditions for which the super-fast regime exists : the deformability of the drop is crucial, and hence the capillary number needs to be larger than a critical value, yet smaller than a threshold above which the bubble breaks up. The two limiting capillary numbers are presented in a phase diagram as a function of the bubble size and the Laplace number.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the hydrodynamic resistance of a disk in a compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity on a rigid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active fluids can exhibit odd viscosity, a property that breaks the time-reversal and parity symmetries. Here, we examine the hydrodynamic flows of a rigid disk moving in a compressible 2D fluid layer with odd viscosity, supported by a thin lubrication layer of a conventional fluid. Using the 2D Green's function in Fourier space, we derive an exact analytical solution for the flow around a disk of arbitrary size, as well as its resistance matrix. The resulting resistance coefficients break the Onsager reciprocity, but satisfy the Onsager-Casimir reciprocity to any order in odd viscosity.</description>

      <title>Slim multi-scale convolutional autoencoder-based reduced-order models for interpretable features of a complex dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant interest in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of reduced-order models (ROMs), convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a universally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn nonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the system. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability. Thus, the resulting model is a black-box which effectively reduces the complexity of the system, but does not provide insights into the meaning of the latent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel interpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains the reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature interpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE architecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our approach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for interpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our results show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and achieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over POD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the number of modes decreases. Additionally, our method delivers interpretable features similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive than existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These approaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only provide interpretability to a limited extend.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical investigation of drag loads on side-by-side flexible blades in a uniform current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the hydrodynamic drag force on side-by-side flexible blades in a uniform steady current through experimental and theoretical approaches. Four different blade mimics were arranged in side-by-side bunches and tested in a circulating water tunnel. The experiments cover a static regime and a dynamic instability regime known as flutter. We examine four non-dimensional parameters to assess their effects on the bulk drag coefficient $C_{D,\mathrm{bulk}}$ and the onset of flutter: the drag-to-stiffness ratio $\mathrm{Ca}$, the buoyancy-to-stiffness ratio $\mathrm{B}$, the mass ratio of fluid inertia to total system inertia $\beta$, and the slenderness parameter $\lambda$, which represents the ratio of the resistive drag to the reactive force. The results show that $C_{D,\mathrm{bulk}}$ decreases in the static regime starting at $\mathrm{Ca}/B &gt; \textit{O}(1)$ and settles to an almost constant value in the flutter regime at high $\mathrm{Ca}$. In the static regime, $\mathrm{B}$ is the primary influencing factor. Increasing $\beta$, $\mathrm{B}$, or $\lambda$ stabilizes the system and delays the onset of flutter. By introducing an equivalent thickness and bending stiffness for a bunch of blades, we utilize well-established analytical and numerical models for individual blades to predict the drag reduction of side-by-side blade assemblies. The analytical model accurately predicts drag reduction in the static regime, while the numerical model effectively predicts both the onset of flutter and drag reduction across both regimes with appropriate cross-flow hydrodynamic coefficients. Meanwhile, we investigate the reactive force terms to unveil their impact on the system stability and drag reduction, demonstrating its superiority over the traditional Morison's equation for highly compliant blades in cross-flow scenarios.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in [20]. Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the gap between continuous and discrete adjoint lattice Boltzmann methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work rigorously derives the continuous and discrete adjoint lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) for open flow systems, with a special focus on the resulting adjoint boundary conditions. It is found that the adjoint collision and adjoint streaming are exactly the same for the two adjoint methods, while the expressions, the objective derivative term and the execution order of the adjoint boundary conditions are totally different. The numerical performances of the two adjoint methods are comprehensively compared by performing sensitivity analysis on the 2D and 3D pipe bend cases. It is found that inconsistency or singularity exists in the continuous adjoint boundary conditions, leading to much inferior numerical stability of the adjoint solution and obvious numerical error in sensitivity. In contrast, the discrete adjoint LBM with fully consistent adjoint boundary conditions can always achieve exact sensitivity results and the theoretically highest numerical stability, without any increase of computational cost, thus it becomes a perfect solution to the inconsistency and instability issues in the continuous adjoint LBM. 3D microchannel heat sinks under various Reynolds numbers are also designed, and the esthetic and physically reasonable optimized designs are obtained, demonstrating the necessity and versatility of the presented discrete adjoint LBM.</description>

      <title>Adaptive GSIS for rarefied gas flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parallel solver of the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), as recently developed by Zhang \textit{et. al.} in Comput. Fluids 281 (2024) 106374, is an efficient method to find the solution of the Boltzmann equation deterministically. However, it consumes a significant computational memory due to the discretization of molecular velocity space in hypersonic flows. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the adaptive GSIS, where the Boltzmann equation is applied only in rarefied regions when the local Knudsen number exceeds a reference value, $\text{Kn}{ref}$. In contrast, the Navier-Stokes equations, with and without the high-order corrections to the constitutive relations, are applied in the continuum and rarefied regimes, respectively. Numerical results indicate that setting $\text{Kn}{ref}=0.01$ yields acceptable outcomes. With the adaptive GSIS, the computational memory and time can be significantly reduced in near-continuum flows, e.g. 24 and 7 times, respectively. in the simulation of rarefied gas flow passing the International Space Station.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of bubble and droplet properties in diffuse-interface two-phase simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of accurately calculating droplet/bubble properties (e.g., volume, number) in diffuse-interface two-phase flow simulations. Currently, flood-fill algorithms can truncate a significant portion of the volume of droplets/bubbles contained within the diffuse interface region or artificially merge multiple droplets/bubbles. This error is also dependent on the volume fraction cutoff value, which is typically chosen to be 0.5 arbitrarily, in the flood-fill algorithms. We propose a simple volume-correction approach that incorporates an analytical approximation of the truncated volume to correct for the missing droplet/bubble volumes. This proposed method results in accurately recovering the dispersed phase volumes with minimal volume error over a wide range of volume fraction cutoff values; and hence, can also accurately recover the number of droplets/bubbles. This can be a valuable tool for accurate calculation of drop/bubble size distributions for analysis and for Eulerian-to-Lagrangian conversion of the dispersed phase in multi-scale modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of inflow boundary-layer turbulence effects on cavity flame stabilisation in a model scramjet combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersonic lean premixed hydrogen/air combustion stabilised by a cavity-flame holder within a model scramjet, characterized by a Mach 1.5 inflow at 1000 K and 50 kPa, is investigated via direct numerical simulation. By separately implementing wall-bounded turbulent and laminar inlet conditions, this work analysis various physical processes of flame stabilization and turbulence-flame interactions to study the influence of inflow boundary layer conditions. Findings indicate that combustion occurred within the cavity shear layer in both cases and propagated downstream along the lower wall. Also, the server impingement at the rear wall in the case with laminar inflow leads to greater cavity resistance. Furthermore, the studies on gas exchange and transport process indicates that with laminar inflow the entered gas accumulates in the back part of the cavity via the intensive mass exchange process and weaker interaction between the primary and secondary vortices. Flame stretch and thickness are further investigated to shed light into turbulence-flame interaction in supersonic flows. Findings indicates that the case with inflow wall-bounded turbulence show similar behaviours compared to previous studies, whereas the observed phenomena in front part of cavity shear layer are differ due to the presence of roll-up vortices in the case with laminar inflow. Overall, the influence of tangential strain rate and curvature are consistent with the preceding results and the evolution of flame thickness is caused by the combined effect of the two factors in both cases.</description>

      <title>Preventing sinking of a disk by leveraging the boundary jump phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is commonly expected that a metal disk placed on the surface of water will sink, our investigation has revealed a surprising phenomenon: a vertical jet directed onto the disk from above can allow it to remain afloat. This result defies intuition, as one would assume that the force of the jet's impact would cause the disk to sink. We have discovered that this phenomenon occurs as a result of water displacement from the top of the disk caused by the impacting jet, operating through a mechanism similar to the hydraulic jump. This displacement generates a difference in hydrostatic pressures, resulting in an upward buoyancy force capable of balancing the force of gravity. In contrast to the classical case, here the jump radius is fixed by the geometric parameters of a disk, a phenomenon we refer to as the boundary jump. To further explore this effect, we have presented a theoretical model based on scaling laws, which provides the conditions required for the disk to float. The dimensionless scaling constant's value was determined through an independent experiment. Finally, we conducted experiments on the disk's floating and sinking, which showed a good match with the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Invisible Hydrodynamic Tweezers Based on Near-Zero Index Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulating particles, such as cells and tissues, in a flowing liquid environment is crucial for life science research. Traditional contactless tweezers, although widely used for single-cell manipulation, face several challenges. These include potential damage to the target, restriction to static environments, complex excitation setups, and interference outside the target area. To address these issues, we propose an ``invisible hydrodynamic tweezer'' utilizing near-zero index hydrodynamic metamaterials. This metamaterial-based device creates an equipotential resistance zone, effectively immobilizing particles in flowing fluids without disturbing the external flow field and without causing damage to the targets. Unlike traditional active control methods, our tweezer passively captures and releases particles by adjusting the flow channel, eliminating the need for continuous and stable excitation devices, thereby significantly simplifying the setup complexity. Furthermore, these tweezers can be modularly designed in different sizes to flexibly accommodate various application needs. Simulations and experimental validations demonstrated the non-interfering, stable trapping, and precise movement capabilities of these tweezers. This proposed technique holds significant potential for applications in biomedicine, microfluidics, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an improved definition of new conserved quantities derived from the energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime by introducing an additional scalar function. We find that the conserved current and the associated conserved charge become geometric under a certain initial condition of the scalar function, and show that such a conserved geometric current generally exists in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometric conserved current agrees with the entropy current in an effective theory of a perfect fluid, thus the conserved charge is the total entropy of the system. While the geometric charge can be regarded as the entropy for a nondissipative fluid, its physical meaning should be investigated for more general cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann framework for multiphase flows by Eulerian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is relatively straightforward, it demands a well-crafted framework to handle the complex partial differential equations involved in multiphase flow simulations. For the first time to our knowledge, this work proposes a novel LBM framework to solve Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow equations, without any finite difference correction, including very large density ratios and also a realistic relation for the drag coefficient. The proposed methodology and all reported LBM formulas can be applied to any dimension. This opens a promising venue for simulating multiphase flows on large High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and on novel parallel hardware. This LBM framework consists of six coupled LBM schemes - running on the same lattice - ensuring an efficient implementation in large codes with minimum effort. The preliminary numeral results agree in an excellent way with the a reference numerical solution obtained by a traditional finite difference solver.</description>

      <title>The helicity distribution for the 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the helicity associated to solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. We show that under mild conditions on the regularity of the velocity field of an incompressible ideal fluid it is possible to define a defect distribution describing the local helicity balance. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we also provide the global helicity balance on bounded domains in terms of the boundary contributions of the vorticity, velocity and pressure.</description>

      <title>Insights into Transient Dynamics of Bacteria Laden Liquid Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.</description>

      <title>A Pioneering Neural Network Method for Efficient and Robust Fluid Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid simulation is an important research topic in computer graphics (CG) and animation in video games. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for efficient and robust fluid simulation in complex environments. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. We conducted comprehensive experiments on datasets. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.</description>

      <title>Efficient cell-centered nodal integral method for multi-dimensional Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient coarse-mesh nodal integral method (NIM), based on cell-centered variables and referred to as cell-centered NIM (CCNIM), is developed and applied for solving multi-dimensional, time-dependent, Burgers equations. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes surface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach formulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns represented by cell-centered or node-averaged variables. By relying on these cell centroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to traditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of local coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of accuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal derivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The multidimensional time-dependent Burgers' problems with known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed scheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach and other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to showcase its effectiveness. The simplicity and robustness of the approach provide a strong foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.</description>
