      <title>The number of countable models of first-order theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout, $T$ denotes a complete first-order theory in a countable language $L$ that has infinite models and $I(\aleph_0,T)$ denotes the number of countable models of $T$, up to an isomorphism. To determine $I(\aleph_0,T)$, it suffices to consider only countable models of $T$ with domain $\omega$; since there are at most continuum many $L$-structures with domain $\omega$, $I(\aleph_0,T)\leqslant 2^{\aleph_0}$ holds. Theories with $I(\aleph_0,T)=1$ are the $\aleph_0$-categorical theories. These include the theory of an infinite set, theories of infinite-dimensional vector spaces over a finite field, and the theory of dense linear orders. Theories with $I(\aleph_0,T)&lt;2^{\aleph_0}$ are said to have few countable models.
  In this paper we discuss and survey work done on Vaught's conjecture, Martin's conjecture, and Ehhrenfeuch theories (theories with more than one but only finitely many, countable models).</description>

      <title>Comparing Notions of Dense Computability on $\omega^\omega$ and $2^\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relatively new topic in computability theory is the study of notions of computation that are robust against mistakes on some kind of small set. However, despite the recent popularity of this topic relatively foundational questions about the notions of reducibility involved still persist. In this paper, we examine two notions of robust information coding, effective dense reducibility and coarse reducibility and answer the question posed in [1]: whether the degrees of functions under these reductions are the same as the degrees of sets. Despite the surface similarity of these two reducibilities we show that every uniform coarse degree contains a set but that this fails even for the non-uniform effective dense degrees. We then further distinguish these two notions by showing that whether g is coarsely reducible to f is an arithmetic property of f and g while for non-uniform effective dense reducibility it is a $\Pi^1_1$ complete property. To prove these results we introduce notions of forcing that allow us to build generic effective dense and coarse descriptions which may be of use in further exploration of these topics - including the open questions we pose in the final section.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Inference Sequent Calculus for Basic Propositional Team Logic (Without Delving Too Deep)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a sequent calculus for the propositional team logic with both the split disjunction and the inquisitive disjunction consisting of a Gentzen-style system (G3-like) for classical propositional logic together with two deep-inference rules for the inquisitive disjunction. We show that the system satisfies various desirable properties: it admits height-preserving weakening, contraction and inversion; it supports a procedure for constructing cutfree proofs and countermodels similar to that for G3cp; and cut elimination holds as a corollary of cut elimination for the G3-style subsystem together with a normal form theorem for cutfree derivations. We also prove a sequent interpolation theorem for the system that yields a novel Lyndon's interpolation theorem for the logic as a corollary.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism of almost locally compact Polish metric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological space is almost locally compact if it contains a dense locally compact subspace. We generalize a result from \cite{Ma}, showing that isomorphism on Borel classes of almost locally compact Polish metric structures is always classifiable by countable structures. This allows to remove a gap in the proof presented in \cite{Ma} of a positive answer to a question of Gao and Kechris, who asked whether isometry of locally compact Polish metric spaces is classifiable by countable structures.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for Second-order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) for second-order logic (S-oL), providing an inferentialist alternative to both full and Henkin model-theoretic interpretations. Our approach is grounded in base-extension semantics (B-eS), a framework in which meaning is determined by inferential roles relative to atomic systems -- collections of rules that encode an agent's pre-logical inferential commitments. We show how both classical and intuitionistic versions of S-oL emerge from this set-up by varying the class of atomic systems. These systems yield modular soundness and completeness results for corresponding Hilbert-style calculi, which we prove equivalent to Henkin's account of S-oL. In doing so, we reframe second-order quantification as systematic substitution rather than set-theoretic commitment, thereby offering a philosophically lightweight yet expressive semantics for higher-order logic. This work contributes to the broader programme of grounding logical meaning in use rather than reference and offers a new lens on the foundations of logic and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Inner models from extended logics and the Delta-operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{L}$ is an abstract logic (a.k.a. model theoretic logic), we can define the inner model $C(\mathcal{L})$ by replacing first order logic with $\mathcal{L}$ in G\"odel's definition of the inner model $L$ of constructible sets. Set theoretic properties of such inner models $C(\mathcal{L})$ have been investigated recently and a spectrum of new inner models is emerging between $L$ and $\mathrm{HOD}$. The topic of this paper is the effect on $C(\mathcal{L})$ of a slight modification of $\mathcal{L}$ i.e. how sensitive is $C(\mathcal{L})$ on the exact definition of $\mathcal{L}$? The $\Delta$-extension $\Delta(\mathcal{L})$ of a logic is generally considered a "mild" extension of $\mathcal{L}$. We give examples of logics $\mathcal{L}$ for which the inner model $C(\mathcal{L})$ is consistently strictly smaller than the inner model $C(\Delta(\mathcal{L}))$, and in one case we show this follows from the existence of $0^{\sharp}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08201v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study definable variants of the notion of the distinguishing number of a graph in descriptive set theoretic setting. We introduce the notion of the Borel distinguishing number of a Borel graph and provide examples that separate distinguishing number and Borel distinguishing number at various levels. More specifically, we prove that there exist Borel graphs with countable distinguishing number but uncountable Borel distinguishing number and that, for every integer $n \geq 3$, there exists a Borel graph with distinguishing number $2$ whose Borel distinguishing number is finite and at least $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that bicategories of spans capture the Beck-Chevalley relationship underlying the adjunctions suitable for the semantics of existential quantification. By viewing hyperdoctrines from a double-categorical lens, this paper shows that we can also characterise the Frobenius property: (generalised) regular hyperdoctrines correspond to those lax symmetric monoidal double pseudofunctors from spans to quintets whose monoidal laxators provide companion commuter cells (in the sense of Par\'e). This suggests a new notion of regular double hyperdoctrine. As an application, we discuss how we can recover a form of graphical regular logic suitable for modelling specifications of systems (e.g., port-plugging systems) that compose operadically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A random rooted graph is said to be sofic if it is the Benjamini-Schramm limit of a sequence of finite graphs. Given any finite graph $H$, we prove that every one-ended, unimodular random rooted graph that does not have H as a minor must be sofic. The hypothesis regarding the number of ends can be dropped under the additional assumption that the graph is quasi-transitive.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Models of Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07736v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homotopy type theory is a modern foundation for mathematics that introduces the univalence axiom and is particularly suitable for the study of homotopical mathematics and its formalization via proof assistants. In order to better comprehend the mathematical implications of homotopy type theory, a variety of models have been constructed and studied. Here a model is understood as a model category with suitable properties implementing the various type theoretical constructors and axioms. A first example is the simplicial model due to Kapulkin--Lumsdaine--Voevodsky. By now, many other models have been constructed, due to work of Arndt, Kapulkin, Lumsdaine, Warren and particularly Shulman, culminating in a proof that every Grothendieck $\infty$-topos can be obtained as the underlying $\infty$-category of a model category that models homotopy type theory.
  In this paper we propose the filter quotient construction as a new method to construct further models of homotopy type theory. Concretely, we prove that with minor assumptions, the filter quotient construction preserves all model categorical properties individually that implement various type theoretical constructors and axioms. On the other hand, the filter quotient construction does not preserve many external properties that are of set theoretical nature, such as cocompleteness, local presentability or cofibrant generation. Combining these, the filter quotient construction preserves models of homotopy type theory and can result in models that have not been considered before and exhibit behaviors that diverge from any of the established models.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Homotopy Type Theory is not just Simplicial: What are $\infty$-Categories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07737v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\infty$-category theory was originally developed in the context of classical homotopy theory using standard set theoretical assumptions, but has since been extended to a variety of mathematical foundations. One such successful effort, primarily due to Martini and Wolf, introduced a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to the foundation of an arbitrary Grothendieck $\infty$-topos, meaning they used categorical foundations. Another approach, due to Riehl and Shulman, developed a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to their own type theory: simplicial homotopy type theory (sHoTT), meaning they employed a (homotopy) type theoretic foundation.
  One aspect of developing a theory of $\infty$-categories in different foundations consists of introducing ways to translate from one foundation to another. Concretely, as part of their work, Riehl and Shulman prove that $\infty$-categories internal to Grothendieck $\infty$-topoi give us categorical models of sHoTT. In fact the name ``simplicial'' in sHoTT suggests that all categorical models of sHoTT should be given by simplicial objects in suitable $\infty$-categories. In this paper we prove that contrary to this expectation, there are models of sHoTT that are not simply simplicial objects. This suggests that in a general foundations, the notion of $\infty$-category is more general than previously assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the author's previous study \cite{Kura20}, showing that several weak principles inspired by non-normal modal logic suffice to derive various refined forms of the second incompleteness theorem. Among the main results of the present paper, we show that the set $\{\mathbf{E},\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D3}\}$ suffices to establish the unprovability of the consistency statement $\neg\, \mathrm{Pr}_T(\ulcorner 0=1 \urcorner)$. We also prove that the set $\{\mathbf{E}^{\mathrm{U}}, \mathbf{CB_{\exists}}\}$ yields formalized $\Sigma_1$-completeness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in our understanding of higher derived limits carry multiple implications in the fields of condensed and pyknotic mathematics, as well as for the study of strong homology. These implications are thematically diverse, pertaining, for example, to the sheaf theory of extremally disconnected spaces, to Banach--Smith duality, to the productivity of compact projective condensed anima, and to the structure of the derived category of condensed abelian groups. Underlying each of these implications are the combinatorics of multidimensionally coherent families of functions of small infinite cardinal height, and it is for this reason that we convene accounts of them together herein.</description>

      <title>Interpolation for the two-way modal mu-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-way modal mu-calculus is the extension of the (standard) one-way mu-calculus with converse (backward-looking) modalities. For this logic we introduce two new sequent-style proof calculi: a non-wellfounded system admitting infinite branches and a finitary, cyclic version of this that employs annotations. As is common in sequent systems for two-way modal logics, our calculi feature an analytic cut rule. What distinguishes our approach is the use of so-called trace atoms, which serve to apply Vardi's two-way automata in a proof-theoretic setting. We prove soundness and completeness for both systems and subsequently use the cyclic calculus to show that the two-way mu-calculus has the (local) Craig interpolation property, with respect to both propositions and modalities. Our proof uses a version of Maehara's method adapted to cyclic proof systems. As a corollary we prove that the two-way mu-calculus also enjoys Beth's definability property.</description>
