      <title>Keynesian chaos revisited: odd period cycles and ergodic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two standard (Keynesian) dynamic macroeconomic models (one is piecewise linear and the other is nonlinear). Our purpose is twofold: (1)~For each model, we give a complete characterisation for the existence of a topological chaos (of the GDP levels), (2)~Even if a chaos exists, using ergodic theory, we show that it is possible to predict the future GDP levels "on average". This paper gives a new application of a celebrated result in ergodic theory by A. Avila (2014 fields medalist). We believe that our method/strategy in this paper is generic enough to be used to analyse many other (seemingly untractable) chaotic economic models.</description>

      <title>Concentration-Based Inference for Evaluating Horizontal Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antitrust authorities routinely rely on concentration measures to evaluate the potential negative impacts of mergers. Using a first-order approximation argument with logit and CES demand, I show that the welfare effect of a merger on consumer surplus is proportional to the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, where the proportionality coefficient depends on price responsiveness parameter, market size, and the distribution of merging firms' shares. This paper elucidates how HHI measures inform the market power effects of mergers.</description>

      <title>Using satellite imagery to monitor remote rural economies at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite global progress in reducing extreme poverty, stubborn pockets remain, often in remote and fragile regions. A fundamental obstacle to further progress is that remoteness and fragility also constrain data collection on economic conditions. We present a new approach to monitor remote economies using satellite images that capture activity at periodic markets, focal points for rural trade throughout history and much of the world today. We describe how to detect markets without pre-existing maps and how to construct an up-to-weekly measure of their activity. We show that we successfully detect markets and that activity correlates with other measures of economic conditions, captures seasonal patterns, and responds to local weather and conflict. The imagery's global availability and high frequency enable real-time monitoring independent of ground conditions.</description>

      <title>The Pay and Non-Pay Content of Job Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How informative are job ads about the actual pay and amenities offered by employers? Using a comprehensive database of job ads posted by Norwegian employers, we develop a methodology to systematically classify the information on both pay and non-pay job attributes advertised in vacancy texts. We link this information to measures of employer attractiveness, which we derive from a job search model estimated on observed wages and worker mobility flows. About 55 percent of job ads provide information related to pay and nearly all ads feature information on non-pay attributes. We show that publicly advertised job attributes are meaningful predictors of employer attractiveness, and non-pay attributes are about as predictive as pay-related attributes. High-pay employers mention pay-related attributes more often, while high-amenity employers are more likely to advertise flexible working hours and contract duration.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in area and regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental quantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize. Without capturing the biases that may be present, naive calculations of population-level estimates from such maps are statistically invalid. In this paper, we compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratification, Olofsson area estimation method, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote sensing map products to generate statistically valid estimates. Applying these methods across four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient estimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than naively using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Prediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the map product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose a map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply prediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2) perform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the utility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream applications, we recommend that map producers provide a holdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty quantification alongside their maps.</description>

      <title>The WTP-WTA Gap for Public Goods: New Insights from Compensating and Equivalent Variation Closed-Form Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study finds exact closed-form solutions for compensating variation (CV) and equivalent variation (EV) for both marginal and non-marginal changes in public goods given homothetic utility. The parameters for these solutions are recoverable from observable data in empirical applications as a single sufficient statistic summarizes consumer preferences. The closed-form CV and EV expressions identify three economic mechanisms that determine the magnitudes of CV and EV. One of these mechanisms, the relative preference effect, helps explain the disparity between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) for public goods.</description>
