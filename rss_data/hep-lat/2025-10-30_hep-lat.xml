      <title>Group-Equivariant Diffusion Models for Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near the critical point, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of lattice quantum field theories (LQFT) become increasingly inefficient due to critical slowing down. In this work, we investigate score-based symmetry-preserving diffusion models as an alternative strategy to sample two-dimensional $\phi^4$ and ${\rm U}(1)$ lattice field theories. We develop score networks that are equivariant to a range of group transformations, including global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflections, local ${\rm U}(1)$ rotations, and periodic translations $\mathbb{T}$. The score networks are trained using an augmented training scheme, which significantly improves sample quality in the simulated field theories. We also demonstrate empirically that our symmetry-aware models outperform generic score networks in sample quality, expressivity, and effective sample size.</description>

      <title>Using Exascale Computing to Explain the Delicate Balance of Nuclear Forces in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of visible matter in our universe comes from protons and neutrons (the nucleons). Nucleon interactions are fundamental to how the universe developed after the Big Bang and govern all nuclear phenomena. The subtle balance in how two nucleons interact shapes the universe's hydrogen content that is central to our existence. Our objective is to compute the interaction strength while varying the parameters of nature to understand how delicate this balance is. We developed a new code using sophisticated physics algorithms and a highly optimized library for simulations on CPU-GPU parallel architectures. It has excellent weak scaling and impressive linear scaling for a fixed problem size with increasing number of nodes up to El Capitan's full $\sim$11,000 nodes. On Alps, El Capitan, Frontier, Jupiter, and Perlmutter supercomputers we achieve a maximum disruptive speed-up of $\sim$240 times the previous state-of-the-art, signaling a new era of supercomputing.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized gluon PDF of the nucleon from lattice QCD in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function employing large-momentum effective theory. The calculation is carried out on the 2+1 flavour CLQCD ensembles with three lattice spacings a={0.105,0.0897,0.0775} fm and pion mass of approximately 300 MeV, covering nulceon momenta up to 1.97 GeV. Distillation technique is applied to improve the signal of two-point correlators. We then apply the state-of-the-art hybrid renormalization and one-loop perturbative matching, and extrapolate the result to the continuum and infinite momentum limit. Our result is in agreement with that from global analysis within errors.</description>

      <title>Finite density QCD phase structure from strangeness fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charting the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at large density is a challenging task due to the complex action problem in lattice simulations. Through simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ we observe that, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness chemical potential $\mu_S/\mu_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $\chi_2^S$ take on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $\mu_B$. We present new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $\mu_S/\mu_B$ or $\chi_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good proxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly influenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum limits for these proxies up to $\mu_B = 400$ MeV, through a next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on large-statistics data on $16^3 \times 8$, $20^3 \times 10$ and $24^3 \times 12$ lattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in excellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and, strikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. On the $16^3 \times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the extrapolation beyond $\mu_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the HRG model. This suggests that the crossover line constructed from this proxy starts deviating from the chemical freeze-out line near $\mu_B\approx500$ MeV, as expected but not yet observed.</description>

      <title>Position-space sampling for local multiquark operators in lattice QCD using distillation and the importance of tetraquark operators for $T_{cc}(3875)^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining hadronic two-point functions is a central step in spectroscopy calculations in lattice QCD. This requires solving the Dirac equation repeatedly, which is computationally demanding. The distillation method addresses this difficulty by using the lowest eigenvectors of the spatial Laplacian to construct a subspace in which the Dirac operator can be fully inverted. This approach is efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson and baryon-baryon operators. However, local multiquark operators with four or more (anti)quarks are computationally expensive in this framework: the cost of contractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors. We present a position-space sampling method within distillation that reduces this cost scaling by performing the momentum projection only over sparse grids rather than the full spatial lattice. We demonstrate the efficiency of this unbiased estimator for single-meson, single-baryon and local tetraquark operators. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point, we apply this method to study the importance of local tetraquark operators for the finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum. To this end, we extend a large basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators by including local tetraquark operators. The inclusion of local operators leads to significant shifts in several energy levels. Finally, we show the effect of these shifts on the $DD^*$ scattering phase shift from a single-channel $s$-wave L\"uscher analysis.</description>

      <title>Generative sampling with physics-informed kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a generative network for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field theories and beyond, for which the learning of layerwise propagation is done and optimised independently on each layer. The architecture uses physics-informed renormalisation group flows that provide access to the layerwise propagation step from one layer to the next in terms of a simple first order partial differential equation for the respective renormalisation group kernel through a given layer. Thus, it transforms the generative task into that of solving once the set of independent and linear differential equations for the kernels of the transformation. As these equations are analytically known, the kernels can be refined iteratively. This allows us to structurally tackle out-of-domain problems generally encountered in generative models and opens the path to further optimisation. We illustrate the practical feasibility of the architecture within simulations in scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>Moments of parton distributions functions of the pion from lattice QCD using gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative determination of the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) moment ratios $\left\langle x^{n-1} \right\rangle / \left\langle x \right\rangle$ up to $n=6$, using the gradient flow in lattice QCD. As a testing ground, we employ SU($3$) isosymmetric gauge configurations generated by the OpenLat initiative with a pseudoscalar mass of $m_\pi \simeq 411~\text{MeV}$. Our analysis uses four lattice spacings and a nonperturbatively improved action, enabling full control over the continuum extrapolation, and the limit of vanishing flow time, $t\to0$. The flowed ratios exhibit O($a^2$) scaling across the ensembles, and the continuum-extrapolated results, matched to the $\overline {\text{MS}}$ scheme at $\mu = 2$ GeV using next-to-next-to-leading order matching coefficients, show only mild residual flow-time dependence. The resulting ratios, computed with a relatively small number of configurations, are consistent with phenomenological expectations for the pion's valence distribution, with statistical uncertainties that are competitive with modern global fits. These findings demonstrate that the gradient flow provides an efficient and systematically improvable method to access partonic quantities from first principles. Future extensions of this work will target lighter pion masses toward the physical point, and applications to nucleon structure such as the proton PDFs and the gluon and sea-quark distributions.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Noise Models and Optimal Thresholds of the 3D Toric Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20489v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Equivalent class of Emergent Single Weyl Fermion in 3d Topological States: gapless superconductors and superfluids Vs chiral fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we put forward a practical but generic approach towards constructing a large family of $(3+1)$ dimension lattice models which can naturally lead to a single Weyl cone in the infrared (IR) limit. Our proposal relies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go theorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete paths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected states (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with time-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum critical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e. $\delta N_w=2$ where $\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the tQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of gapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where tQCPs, with $\delta N_w \geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry breaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single Weyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class topological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a $T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an equivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the conserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a $T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators typically span a two-dimensional linear space instead. Finally, we pinpoint connections between three spatial dimensional lattice chiral fermion models and gapless real fermions that can naturally appear in superfluids or superconductors studied previously.</description>

      <title>An extraction of the Collins-Soper kernel from a joint analysis of experimental and lattice data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first joint extraction of the Collins-Soper kernel (CSK) combining experimental and lattice QCD data in the context of an analysis of transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs). Based on a neural-network parametrization, we perform a Bayesian reweighting of an existing fits of TMDs using lattice data, as well as a joint TMD fit to lattice and experimental data. We consistently find that the inclusion of lattice information shifts the central value of the CSK by approximately 10% and reduces its uncertainty by 40-50%, highlighting the potential of lattice inputs to improve TMD extractions.</description>

Abstract: We employ quantum variational methods to investigate a single-site interacting fermion--boson system -- an example of a minimal supersymmetric model that can exhibit spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Our study addresses the challenges inherent in calculating mixed fermion--boson systems and explores the potential of quantum computing to advance their analysis. By using adaptive variational techniques, we identify optimal ans\"atze that scale efficiently, allowing for reliable identification of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. This work lays a foundation for future quantum computing investigations of more complex and physically rich fermion--boson quantum field theories in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity from quenched to full lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shear viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) plays a crucial role in interpreting current measurements from heavy-ion collisions and is a key input to hydro-dynamical models. The interest in shear viscosity also lies in the fact that QGP is the most ideal fluid ever observed and has the shear viscosity to entropy ratio ($\eta / s$) close to the theoretical bound $\eta / s \geq 1/ 4 \pi$ in the strong coupling region within AdS/CFT formalism. The lattice determination of $\eta / s$ has been explored for the pure gauge case, but its determination in full QCD remains unexplored, despite its significant importance. In this proceeding, we present updates on extending our quenched findings to full QCD. Specifically, we focus on the renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor with the gradient flow method and provide a progress update on determining the relevant renormalization coefficients for shear viscosity. For this purpose, we have used an imaginary isospin chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the properties of $X(3872)$ and of its isovector partner $W_{c1}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a simultaneous fit to BESIII data on $e^+e^-\to \gamma (D^0{\bar{D}^{0}}\pi^0/J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ and LHCb data on $B^+\to K^+(J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ to precisely determine the properties of the $X(3872)$, with full consideration of three-body effects from $D^*\to D\pi$ decay, respecting both analyticity and unitarity. The $X(3872)$ is determined to be a quasi-bound state with a significance of $2.7\,\sigma$, representing the most precise determination to date. Its pole is located at $\left(-160^{+57}_{-74}-125^{+23}_{-38}\,i\right) \rm keV$, relative to the nominal $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ threshold. Moreover, we confirm the presence of an isovector partner state, $W_{c1}$. It is found as a virtual state at $\left(3.1\pm0.7+ 1.3^{+1.9}_{-0.6}\,i\right)\ \rm MeV$ relative to the $D^+ D^{*-}$ threshold on an unphysical Riemann sheet, strongly supporting a molecular nature of both $X(3872)$ and $W_{c1}$. As a highly nontrivial prediction we show that the $W_{c1}$ leads to nontrivial lineshapes around 3.88 GeV in $B^0\to K^0 X(3872)\to K^0 D^0\bar D^0\pi^0$ and $K^0J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ -- thus the scheme presented here can be tested further by improved measurements.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulations of scattering in quantum field theories using W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of collisions and the formation of subsequent many-particle states. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 104 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 5,589 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. An outgoing heavy particle produced in the collision is identified from the skewness of the measured energy density. Integral to this computation is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>

      <title>Complex wave functions, CPT and quantum field theory for classical generalized Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models.
  We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$).
  A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions.
  Simple two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions.
  Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables.
  For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations.
  For the correlation function one finds the Lorentz-invariant Feynman propagator of quantum field theory.
  Furthermore, these automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution.
  PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions.
  For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-six operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the third part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): insertions of dimension-six operators that conserve baryon number. In line with our previous publications, we obtain the results in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations. We compute the renormalization of the dimension-six four-fermion and three-gluon operators, as well as the power corrections to lower-dimension operators in the presence of masses, i.e., the down-mixing into dimension-five dipole operators, masses, gauge couplings, and theta terms. Our results are of interest for a broad range of low-energy precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>
