      <title>$\mathcal{X}$-Gorenstein projective and $\mathcal{Y}$-Gorenstein injective modules over tensor rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T_R(M)$ be a tensor ring and $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ be two classes of $R$-modules. Under certain conditions, we prove that a $T_R(M)$-module $(A, u)$ is $Ind(\mathcal{X})$-Gorenstein projective if and only if $u$ is monomorphic and $coker(u)$ is an $\mathcal{X}$-Gorenstein projective $R$-module. $\mathcal{Y}$-Gorenstein injective $T_R(M)$-modules are also explicitly described. As a consequence, the characterizations of Ding projective and Ding injective modules over $T_R(M)$ are obtained. Some applications to trivial ring extensions and Morita context rings are given.</description>

      <title>A Mnemonic Matrix Rule for (Split) Octonionic Multiplication and its Extension to the Cayley--Dickson Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact mnemonic device for computing the product of two (split) octonions represented in quaternionic form q+ l p. The rule is expressed as a simple (R+L) pattern of ``right-ordered'' and ``left-ordered'' quaternionic products, visible within a 2 X 2 quaternionic matrix representation of the Cayley--Dickson construction. This formulation extends verbatim to all algebras in the Cayley--Dickson tower, and provides an efficient computational tool in non-associative settings. To our knowledge, this explicit mnemonic pattern does not appear in the classical literature on octonions or composition algebras.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian integrability of rational vector fields: The case of algebraic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As shown in a previous paper, whenever a rational vector field on $\mathbb C^n$, $n&gt;2$, is Liouvillian integrable, then it admits a first integral obtained by two successive integrations from a one-form with coefficients in a finite algebraic extension $L$ of the rational function field $K$. In the present work we discuss and characterize exceptional vector fields in this class, for which -- by definition -- the choice $L=K$ is not possible. In particular we show that exceptional vector field exist, giving explicit constructions in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Derived Gamma Geometry II: Stable $\infty$-Categories of Gamma-Modules, Derived Monoidal Structures, and Obstructions to Binary Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(\T\) be a commutative ternary \(\Gm\)-semiring in the sense of the triadic, \(\Gm\)-parametrized multiplication \(\{a,b,c\}_{\gamma}\). Building on the affine \(\Gm\)-spectrum \(\SpecG(\T)\), the structure sheaf, and the equivalence between \(\Gm\)-modules and quasi-coherent \(\Gm\)-sheaves on affine \(\Gm\)-schemes, we construct and organize the derived formalism at the level of stable \(\infty\)-categories.
  Our first contribution is a technically explicit construction of a stable \(\infty\)-category \(\Dinfty(\T,\Gm)\) enhancing the unbounded derived category of \(\Gm\)-modules, obtained by dg-nerve and \(\infty\)-localization of chain complexes. We further explain the derived monoidal structure induced by the ternary \(\Gm\)-tensor product and the corresponding internal \(\RHom\), under standard exactness/projectivity hypotheses.
  Our second contribution is an obstruction theory to \emph{binary reduction}: we formalize the nonexistence of any conservative ``binary module shadow'' compatible with the cubic localization calculus intrinsic to ternary \(\Gm\)-semirings. In particular, any attempt to represent the triadic \(\Gm\)-action by binary scalars forces \(\Gm\)-mode data to be absorbed into the scalars, hence ceases to be a genuine reduction.
  Finally, we give a detailed affine derived equivalence between derived quasi-coherent \(\Gm\)-sheaves on \(X=\SpecG(\T)\) and \(\Dinfty(\T,\Gm)\), and we include worked examples illustrating the cubic localization relation and its derived consequences.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and deformation theory of Reynolds--Nijenhuis associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study Reynolds--Nijenhuis operators on associative algebras a novel hybrid structure that simultaneously satisfies the defining identities of both Reynolds and Nijenhuis operators. We investigate their connections with Rota-Baxter and modified Rota-Baxter operators. We develop a representation theory for Reynolds--Nijenhuis associative algebras and introduce a corresponding cohomology theory. Furthermore, we establish a one-parameter formal deformation theory for these algebras, examining the role of infinitesimals, rigidity, and equivalence in the context of deformations.</description>

      <title>On the Limiting Density of a gcd Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The function \[f(a,b)=\frac{\gcd(a+b,ab)}{\gcd(a,b)}\] is of interest in this paper. We then ask a natural question regarding how often $f(a,b)=1$ is. We yield the limiting density $\rho=\prod_{p}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^2(p+1)}\right)\approx 0.88151$ which is an Euler product that unexpectedly matches the quadratic class number constant from the theory of real quadratic fields. We also consider its higher-order analogue $f_r$, where the problem collapses to coprimality and the density becomes $1/\zeta(2)=6/\pi^2$.</description>

      <title>Computing quaternionic representations via twisted forms of Bruhat-Tits trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of representations of finite subgroups of the group of units of quaternion division algebras over a global or local field arising from the inclusion via extension of scalars splitting the algebra. Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hyperderivative Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces Generalized Hyperderivative Reed-Solomon codes (GHRS codes), which generalize NRT Reed-Solomon codes. Its main results are as follows: 1) every GHRS code is MDS, 2) the dual of a GHRS code is also an GHRS code, 3) determine subfamilies of GHRS codes whose members are low-density parity-check codes (LDPCs), and 4) determine a family of GHRS codes whose members are quasi-cyclic. We point out that there are GHRS codes having all of these properties.</description>

      <title>Complex structures on 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras arising from graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the existence of complex structures on 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras arising from finite graphs. We introduce the notion of adapted complex structure, namely a complex structure that maps vertices and edges of the graph to vertices and edges, and we analyze in depth the restrictions imposed by the integrability condition. We completely characterize the graphs that admit abelian adapted complex structures, showing that they belong to a small family of graphs that we call basic. We prove that any graph endowed with an adapted complex structure $J$ contains a unique $J$-invariant basic spanning subgraph, and conversely, that every such graph can be constructed through a systematic expansion procedure starting from a basic graph. We also explore geometric and combinatorial consequences, including the existence of special Hermitian metrics as well as other graph-theoretic properties.</description>
