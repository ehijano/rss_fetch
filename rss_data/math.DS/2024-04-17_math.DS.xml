      <title>Orientation Preserving Homeomorphisms of the Plane having BP-Chain Recurrent Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than a century ago, L. E. J. Brouwer proved a famous theorem, which says that any orientation preserving homeomorphism of the plane having a periodic point must have a fixed point. In recent years, there are still some authors giving various proofs of this fixed point theorem. In \cite{Fa}, Fathi showed that the condition``having a periodic point'' in this theorem can be weakened to ``having a non-wandering point''. In this paper, we first give a new proof of Brouwer's theorem, which is relatively more simpler and the statement is more compact. Further, we propose a notion of BP-chain recurrent points, which is a generalization of the concept of non-wandering points, and we prove that if an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the plane has a BP-chain recurrent point, then it has a fixed point. This further weakens the condition in the Brouwer's fixed point theorem on plane.</description>

      <title>Drift estimation in stochastic flows using kernel integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic differential equation (SDE) describes a motion in which a particle is governed simultaneously by the direction provided by a vector field / drift, and the scattering effects of white noise. The resulting motion can only be described as a random process instead of a solution curve. Due to the non-deterministic nature of this motion, the task of determining the drift from data is quite challenging, since the data does not directly represent the directional information of the flow. This paper describes an interpretation of vector field as a conditional expectation, which makes its estimation feasible via kernel-integral methods. It presents a numerical procedure based on kernel integral operators, that computes this expectation. In addition, some techniques are presented which can overcome the challenge of dimensionality if the SDE's carry some structure enabling sparsity.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of infinitely generated self-affine sets and restricted digit sets for signed L\"uroth expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For countably infinite IFSs on $\mathbb R^2$ consisting of affine contractions with diagonal linear parts, we give conditions under which the affinity dimension is an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension and a lower bound for the lower box-counting dimension. Moreover, we identify a family of countably infinite IFSs for which the Hausdorff and affinity dimension are equal, and which have full dimension spectrum. The corresponding self-affine sets are related to restricted digit sets for signed L\"uroth expansions.</description>

      <title>Zero-Sum Games for Volterra Integral Equations and Viscosity Solutions of Path-Dependent Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a game, in which the dynamics is described by a non-linear Volterra integral equation of Hammerstein type with a weakly-singular kernel and the goals of the first and second players are, respectively, to minimize and maximize a given cost functional. We propose a way of how the dynamic programming principle can be formalized and the theory of generalized (viscosity) solutions of path-dependent Hamilton--Jacobi equations can be developed in order to prove the existence of the game value, obtain a characterization of the value functional, and construct players' optimal feedback strategies.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of blow-up profiles for a quasilinear diffusion equation with source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify radially symmetric self-similar profiles presenting finite time blow-up to the quasilinear diffusion equation with weighted source $$ u_t=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, $$ posed for $(x,t)\in\real^N\times(0,T)$, $T&gt;0$, in dimension $N\geq1$ and in the range of exponents $-2&lt;\sigma&lt;\infty$, $1&lt;m&lt;p&lt;p_s(\sigma)$, where $$ p_s(\sigma)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{m(N+2\sigma+2)}{N-2}, &amp; N\geq3,\\ +\infty, &amp; N\in\{1,2\},\end{array}\right. $$ is the renowned Sobolev critical exponent. The most interesting result is the \emph{multiplicity of two different types} of self-similar profiles for $p$ sufficiently close to $m$ and $\sigma$ sufficiently close to zero in dimension $N\geq2$, including \emph{dead-core profiles}. For $\sigma=0$, this answers in dimension $N\geq2$ a question still left open in \cite[Section IV.1.4, pp. 195-196]{S4}, where only multiplicity in dimension $N=1$ had been established. Besides this result, we also prove that, for any $\sigma\in(-2,0)$, $N\geq1$ and $m&lt;p&lt;p_s(\sigma)$ \emph{existence} of at least a self-similar blow-up profile is granted. In strong contrast with the previous results, given any $N\geq1$, $\sigma\geq\sigma^*=(mN+2)/(m-1)$ and $p\in(m,p_s(\sigma))$, \emph{non-existence} of any radially symmetric self-similar profile is proved.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of push-forwards on locally analytic functionals and truncation of least-squares polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for investigating analytic maps from finite discrete data, elucidating mathematical machinery underlying the polynomial approximation with least-squares in multivariate situations. Our approach is to consider the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals, instead of directly handling the analytic map itself. We establish a methodology enabling appropriate finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward from finite discrete data, through the theory of the Fourier--Borel transform and the Fock space. Moreover, we prove a rigorous convergence result with a convergence rate. As an application, we prove that it is not the least-squares polynomial, but the polynomial obtained by truncating its higher-degree terms, that approximates analytic functions and further allows for approximation beyond the support of the data distribution. One advantage of our theory is that it enables us to apply linear algebraic operations to the finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward. Utilizing this, we prove the convergence of a method for approximating an analytic vector field from finite data of the flow map of an ordinary differential equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical zeta functions for billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00683v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D \subset {\mathbb R}^d,\: d \geqslant 2,$ be the union of a finite collection of pairwise disjoint strictly convex compact obstacles. Let $\mu_j \in {\mathbb C},\: {\rm Im}\: \mu_j &gt; 0,$ be the resonances of the Laplacian in the exterior of $D$ with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial D$. For $d$ odd, $u(t) = \sum_j e^{i |t| \mu_j}$ is a distribution in $ \mathcal{D}'({\mathbb R} \setminus \{0\})$ and the Laplace transforms of the leading singularities of $u(t)$ yield the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_{\mathrm N},\: \eta_{\mathrm D}$ for Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively. These zeta functions play a crucial role in the analysis of the distribution of the resonances. Under the non-eclipse condition (1.1), for $d \geqslant 2$ we show that $\eta_{\mathrm N}$ and $\eta_\mathrm D$ admit a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. In the particular case when the boundary $\partial D$ is real analytic, by using a result of Fried (1995), we prove that the function $\eta_\mathrm{D}$ cannot be entire. Following the result of Ikawa (1988), this implies the existence of a strip $\{z \in {\mathbb C}: \: 0 &lt; {\rm Im}\: z \leq\alpha\}$ containing an infinite number of resonances $\mu_j$ for the Dirichlet problem. Moreover, for $\alpha \gg 1$ we obtain a lower bound for the resonances lying in this strip.</description>

      <title>Topological asymptotic dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a study of asymptotic dimension for locally compact groups. This notion extends the existing invariant for discrete groups and is shown to be finite for a large class of residually compact groups. Along the way, the notion of Hirsch length is extended to topological groups and classical results of Hirsch and Malcev are extended using a topological version of the Poincar\'{e} lemma. We show that polycyclic-by-compact groups and compactly generated, topologically virtually nilpotent groups are residually compact, and that compactly generated nilpotent groups are polycyclic-by-compact. We prove that for compactly generated, solvable-by-compact groups the asymptotic dimension is majorized by the Hirsch length, and equality holds for polycyclic-by-compact groups. We extend the class of elementary amenable groups beyond the discrete case and show that topologically elementary amenable groups with finite Hirsch length have finite asymptotic dimension. We prove that a topologically elementary amenable group of finite Hirsch length with no nontrivial locally elliptic normal closed subgroup is solvable-by-compact. Finally, we show that a totally disconnected, locally compact, second countable [SIN]-group has finite asymptotic dimension, if all of its discrete quotients are so.</description>

Abstract: We consider an intermediate factor situation in two categories: probability measure preserving ergodic theory and compact topological dynamics. In the first we prove a master-key theorem and examine a wide range of applications. In the second we treat the case when one of the systems is distal and then provide some counterexamples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct analytic surface symplectomorphisms with unstable elliptic fixed points; this solves a problem of Birkhoff (1927). More precisely, we construct analytic symplectomorphisms of the sphere and of the disk which are transitive, with respectively only 2 and 1 periodic points. This also solves problems of proposed by Herman (1998), Fayad-Katok (2004) and Fayad-Krikorian (2018). To establish these results, we introduce a principle that enables to realize, by an analytic symplectomorphism, properties which are $C^0$-realizable by the approximation by conjugacy method of Anosov-Katok.</description>

Abstract: We study piecewise injective, but not necessarily globally injective, contracting maps on a compact subset of \(\bR^d\). We prove that generically the attractor and the set of discontinuities are disjoint, and hence the attractor consists of periodic orbits.

      <title>Mathematical modelling of the first HIV/ZIKV co-infection cases in Colombia and Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model to investigate co-infection with HIV/AIDS and zika virus (ZIKV) in Colombia and Brazil, where the first cases were reported in 2015-2016. The model considers the sexual transmission dynamics of both viruses and vector-host interactions. We begin by exploring the qualitative behaviour of each model separately. Then, we analyze the dynamics of the co-infection model using the thresholds and results defined separately for each model. The model also considers the impact of intervention strategies, such as, personal protection, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and sexual protection (condoms use). Using available parameter values for Colombia and Brazil, the model is calibrated to predict the potential effect of implementing combinations of those intervention strategies on the co-infection spread. According to these findings, transmission through sexual contact is a determining factor in the long-term behaviour of these two diseases. Furthermore, it is important to note that co-infection with HIV and ZIKV may result in higher rates of HIV transmission and an increased risk of severe congenital disabilities linked to ZIKV infection. As a result, control measures have been implemented to limit the number of infected individuals and mosquitoes, with the aim of halting disease transmission. This study provides novel insights into the dynamics of HIV/ZIKV co-infection and highlights the importance of integrated intervention strategies in controlling the spread of these viruses, which may impact public health</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig latent space Koopman closure for nonlinear autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator presents an attractive approach to achieve global linearization of nonlinear systems, making it a valuable method for simplifying the understanding of complex dynamics. While data-driven methodologies have exhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with various challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables, dimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviors accurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig autoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in low-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder to extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman subspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields a closed representation of dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear autoencoder, thereby enhancing the precision and stability of the Koopman operator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's ability to capture regime transitions in the flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low dimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky with promising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>
