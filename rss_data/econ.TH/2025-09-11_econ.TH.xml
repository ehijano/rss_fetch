      <title>Electoral Competition with Credible Promises and Strategic Voters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can voters induce politicians to put forth more proximate (in terms of preference) as well as credible platforms (in terms of promise fulfillment) under repeated elections? Building on the work of Aragones et al. (2007), I study how reputation and re-election concerns affect candidate behavior and its resultant effect on voters' beliefs and their consequent electoral decisions. I present a formal model where, instead of assuming voters to be naive, I tackle the question by completely characterizing a set of subgame-perfect equilibria by introducing non-naive (or strategic) voting behavior into the mix. I find that non-naive voting behavior, by using the candidate's reputation as an instrument of policy discipline after the election, aids in successfully inducing candidates to put forth their maximal incentive-compatible promise (among a range of such credible promises) in equilibrium. Through the credible threat of punishment in the form of loss of reputation for all future elections, non-naive voters gain a unanimous increase in expected utility relative to when they behave naively. In fact, comparative statics show that candidates who are more likely to win are more likely to keep their promises. In this framework, voters are not only able to bargain for more credible promises but also end up raising their expected future payoffs in equilibrium. Including such forms of strategic behavior thus reduces cheap talk by creating a credible electoral system where candidates do as they say once elected. Later, I present an analysis that includes limited punishment as a political accountability mechanism.</description>

      <title>Incentives for Digital Twins: Task-Based Productivity Enhancements with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is a technology which depends in part on participation by humans in training and improving the automation potential. We focus on the development of an "AI twin" that could complement its creator's efforts, enabling them to produce higher-quality output in their individual style. However, AI twins could also, over time, replace individual humans. We analyze this trade-off using a principal-agent model in which agents have the opportunity to make investments into training an AI twin that lead to a lower cost of effort, a higher probability of success, or both. We propose a new framework to situate the model in which the tasks performed vary in the ease to which AI output can be improved by the human (the "editability") and also vary in the extent to which a non-expert can assess the quality of output (its "verifiability.") Our synthesis of recent empirical studies indicates that productivity gains from the use of generative AI are higher overall when task editability is higher, while non-experts enjoy greater relative productivity gains for tasks with higher verifiability. We show that during investment a strategic agent will trade off improvements in quality and ease of effort to preserve their wage bargaining power. Tasks with high verifiability and low editability are most aligned with a worker's incentives to train their twin, but for tasks where the stakes are low, this alignment is constrained by the risk of displacement. Our results suggest that sustained improvements in company-sponsored generative AI will require nuanced design of human incentives, and that public policy which encourages balancing worker returns with generative AI improvements could yield more sustained long-run productivity gains.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Diagnostic Expectations: Econometric Insights from DSGE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides the first econometric evidence for diagnostic expectations (DE) in DSGE models. Using the identification framework of Qu and Tkachenko (2017), I show that DE generate dynamics unattainable under rational expectations (RE), with no RE parameterization capable of matching the volatility and persistence patterns implied by DE. Consequently, DE are not observationally equivalent to RE and constitute an endogenous source of macroeconomic fluctuations, distinct from both structural frictions and exogenous shocks. From an econometric perspective, DE preserve overall model identification but weaken the identification of shock variances. To ensure robust conclusions across estimation methods and equilibrium conditions, I extend Bayesian estimation with Sequential Monte Carlo sampling to the indeterminacy domain. These findings advance the econometric study of expectations and highlight the macroeconomic relevance of diagnostic beliefs.</description>

      <title>Competition, Persuasion, and Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11183v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An agent engages in sequential search and learns about the quality of sampled goods through signals purchased from profit-maximizing information broker(s). We study how the market structure--the number of competing brokers--shapes the pricing and design of information, as well as the resulting welfare outcomes. We characterize the equilibrium payoff set, and show that when the agent's search cost falls below a threshold, market structure affects neither how much surplus is generated in equilibrium nor how it is divided. Above this threshold, however, competition yields equilibrium outcomes that raise the agent's payoff but reduce total surplus relative to any monopoly equilibrium outcome. Methodologically, we extend the classic theory of repeated games to stopping problems, such as sequential search.</description>

      <title>Waiting for Trade in Markets with Aggregate Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a market in which a patient long-lived seller offers prices to short-lived buyers. A hidden state determines whether the buyers' common value exceeds the seller's reservation value, and all agents only have noisy signals. If the seller has commitment power, the seller waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal to arrive, and else exits the market. Using techniques for monotone decision problems, this waiting strategy is shown to be optimal for learning whether trade is efficient. Due to the interplay between the seller's and the buyers' information, the seller's decision to exit may be non-monotonic in the seller's information, and prices may be non-monotonic over time. Without commitment power, there is an equilibrium in which the seller also waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal, but the seller exits at inefficient times.</description>
