      <title>Dynamic phase transition into a mixed-CDW state in 1$T$-TaS$_2$ via a thermal quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast light-matter interaction has emerged as a new mechanism to exert control over the macroscopic properties of quantum materials toward novel functionality. To date, technological applications of these non-thermal phases are limited by their ultrashort lifetimes and low-ordering temperatures. Among the most studied photoinduced metastable phases for their technological promise is the hidden metallic charge density wave (H-CDW) in the model correlated CDW compound 1$T$-TaS$_2$. Despite active study and engineering, the nature of the photoinduced H-CDW remains the subject of debate and is only accessible at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we stabilize the H-CDW phase at thermal equilibrium up to near-room temperature by accessing an intermediate mixed CDW order regime via thermal quenching. Using x-ray high dynamic range reciprocal space mapping (HDRM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we reveal the coexistence of commensurate (C) CDW and H-CDW domains below 180 K during cooling and below 210 K during warming. Our findings show that each order parameter breaks basal plane mirror symmetry with different chiral orientations and induces out-of-plane unit cell tripling in the H-CDW phase. Despite metallic domain walls and a finite density of states at zero bias observed via STS, bulk resistance remains insulating due to CDW stacking disorder. This study establishes the H-CDW as a thermally stable phase and introduces a new mechanism for switchable metallic behavior in thin flakes of 1$T$-TaS$_2$ and similar materials with competing order phases.</description>

      <title>Pseudosymmetry in Tetragonal Perovskite SrIrO$_3$ Synthesized under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report a tetragonal perovskite structure of SrIrO$_3$ (P4/mmm, a = 3.9362(9) \r{A}, c = 7.880(3) \r{A}) synthesized at 6 GPa and 1400 $\deg$C, employing the ambient pressure monoclinic SrIrO$_3$ with distorted 6H structure as a precursor. The crystal structure of tetragonal SrIrO3 was evaluated on the basis of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction. A cubic indexing was observed attributed to overlooked superlattice reflections. Weak fractional peaks in the H and K dimensions suggest possible structure modulation by oxygen defects. Magnetization study reveals weak paramagnetic behavior down to 2 K, indicative of the interplay between spin-orbit coupling, electron correlations, and crystal electric field. Additionally, measurements of electrical resistivity display metallic behavior with an upturn at about 54 K, ascribed to weak electron localization and possible structural defects.</description>

      <title>Influence of trapped magnetic field of Sn-Pb solders on electrical resistivity measurement: an example of superconducting transition of Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soldering has been used in various scientific and industry cases for long time. In researches of materials science and condensed matter physics, researchers have used soldering to fabricate electrical terminals for characterization of electric properties. In a recent study, anomalously huge magnetic flux trapping has been observed in the Sn-Pb solders after field cooling or high-field experience at low temperatures lower than superconducting transition temperature (T &lt; Tc = 7.2 K) of the solders. In this letter, we tested the affection of the flux-trapped states of solders (Sn60-Pb40) on superconducting properties of a Sn wire (Tc = 3.7 K) because solders have been generally used for investigation of superconducting samples. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity (\r{ho}-T) at H = 0 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC) showed normal sharp superconducting transition at T = 3.7 K. In contrast, the \r{ho}-T after field cooling (FC) showed lowered Tcs and broadening of the superconducting transition. The difference in \r{ho}-T between ZFC and FC states evidences the critical affection of the flux-trapped states of Sn-Pb solders on superconducting states. We propose that, in electrical measurements where magnetic field of several hundred Oe, the field experience should be seriously considered in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Approximations in first-principles volumetric thermal expansion determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of thermal expansion determination, the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) stands as a widely embraced method for discerning minima of free energies across diverse temperatures such that the temperature dependence of lattice parameters as well as internal atomic positions can be determined. However, this methodology often imposes substantial computational demand, necessitating numerous costly calculations of full phonon spectra in a possibly many-dimensional geometry parameter space. Focusing on the volumetric thermal expansion only, the volume-constrained zero static internal stress approximation (v-ZSISA) within QHA allows one to limit significantly the number of phonon spectra determinations to typically less than 10. The linear Gruneisen approach goes even further with only two phonon spectra determinations to find the volumetric thermal expansion, but a deterioration of the accuracy of the computed thermal expansion is observed, except at low temperatures. We streamline this process by introducing further intermediate approximations between the linear Gruneisen and the v-ZSISA-QHA, corresponding to different orders of the Taylor expansion. The minimal number of phonon spectra calculations that is needed to maintain precise outcomes is investigated. The different approximations are tested on a representative set of 12 materials. For the majority of materials, three full phonon spectra, corresponding to quadratic order, is enough to determine the thermal expansion in reasonable agreement with the v-ZSISA-QHA method up to 800 K. Near perfect agreement is obtained with five phonon spectra. This study paves the way to multidimensional generalizations, beyond the volumetric case, with the expectation of much bigger benefits.</description>

      <title>Electrical manipulation of inter-valley trions in twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayers at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive physics and applications of intra- and interlayer excitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide twisted-bilayer make these systems compelling platforms for exploring the manipulation of their optoelectronic properties through electrical fields. This work studies the electrical control of excitons in twisted MoSe$_2$ homobilayer devices at room temperature. Gate-dependent micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals an energy tunability of several meVs originating from the emission of excitonic complexes. Furthermore, it investigates the twist-angle dependence of valley properties by fabricating devices with distinct stacking angles. Strengthened by density functional theory calculations, the results suggest that, depending on the rotation angle, the conduction band minima and hybridized states at the Q-point promote the formation of inter-valley trions involving the Q-and K-points in the conduction band and the K-point in the valence band. Besides exploring the charge-carrier manipulation in twisted homobilayers, our findings open new avenues for engineering multifunctional optoelectronic devices based on ultrathin semiconducting systems.</description>

      <title>In Situ Imaging of Parachute Textile Micro-Mechanics Under Tensile Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-mechanics of parachute fabrics under tensile loads is studied using in situ X-ray micro-tomography. Results are presented for two nylon textiles commonly used in parachute systems, MIL-C-7020H Type III and MIL-C-44378(GL) Type II. Textiles are subjected to incremental tension using a custom apparatus that loads the fabric radially, and the microstructure is imaged sequentially at steady load conditions. Micro-tomography images are processed using learning-aided segmentation and a custom processing pipeline that tracks the locations and morphological properties of individual tows on 3-D datasets. Results are used to reconstruct tow micro-scale properties and meso-scale strains. Our findings reveal a direct relation between the fabric architecture and the meso-scale mechanics. Warp tow pretensioning during manufacturing is found to affect decrimping and the anisotropy of the textile strains. Areal porosity increase with tension is quantified and a geometric model for pore opening under incremental load is validated.</description>

      <title>Large anomalous Hall conductivity in kagome Weyl ferrimagnet Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ predicted by density-functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Impurity contribution to ultraviolet absorption of saturated fatty acids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturated fatty acids are abundant organic compounds in oceans and sea sprays. Their photochemical reactions induced by solar radiation have recently been discovered as an abiotic source of volatile organic compounds, which serve as precursors of secondary organic aerosols. However, photoabsorption of wavelengths longer than 250 nm in liquid saturated fatty acids remains unexplained, despite being first reported in 1931. Here we demonstrate that the previously reported absorption of wavelengths longer than 250 nm by liquid nonanoic acid [CH3(CH2)7COOH)] originates from traces of impurities (0.1% at most) intrinsically contained in nonanoic acid reagents. Absorption cross sections of nonanoic acid newly obtained here indicate that the upper limit of its photolysis rate is three-to-five orders of magnitude smaller than those for atmospherically relevant carbonyl compounds.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of electronic and lattice screening on exciton binding in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. Dielectric confinement is well described by a fractional dimension scaling law as a function of layer thickness. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</description>

      <title>Determination of five-parameter grain boundary characteristics in nanocrystalline Ni-W by Scanning Precession Electron Diffraction Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the full five-parameter grain boundary characteristics from experiments is essential for understanding grain boundaries impact on material properties, improving related models, and designing advanced alloys. However, achieving this is generally challenging, in particular at nanoscale, due to their 3D nature. In our study, we successfully determined the grain boundary characteristics of an annealed nickel-tungsten alloy (NiW) nanocrystalline needle-shaped specimen (tip) containing twins using Scanning Precession Electron Diffraction (SPED) Tomography. The presence of annealing twins in this face-centered cubic (fcc) material gives rise to common reflections in the SPED diffraction patterns, which challenges the reconstruction of orientation-specific virtual dark field (VDF) images required for tomographic reconstruction of the 3D grain shapes. To address this, an automated post-processing step identifies and deselects these shared reflections prior to the reconstruction of the VDF images. Combined with appropriate intensity normalization and projection alignment procedures, this approach enables high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of the individual grains contained in the needle-shaped sample volume. To probe the accuracy of the resulting boundary characteristics, the twin boundary surface normal directions were extracted from the 3D voxelated grain boundary map using a 3D Hough transform. For the sub-set of coherent Sigma 3 boundaries, the expected {111} grain boundary plane normals were obtained with an angular error of less than 3{\textdegree} for boundary sizes down to 400 nm${}^2$. This work advances our ability to precisely characterize and understand the complex grain boundaries that govern material properties.</description>

      <title>SciQu: Accelerating Materials Properties Prediction with Automated Literature Mining for Self-Driving Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing different material properties to predict specific attributes, such as band gap, resistivity, young modulus, work function, and refractive index, is a fundamental requirement for materials science-based applications. However, the process is time-consuming and often requires extensive literature reviews and numerous experiments. Our study addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning to analyze material properties with greater precision and efficiency. By automating the data extraction process and using the extracted information to train machine learning models, our developed model, SciQu, optimizes material properties. As a proof of concept, we predicted the refractive index of materials using data extracted from numerous research articles with SciQu, considering input descriptors such as space group, volume, and bandgap with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.068 and R2 0.94. Thus, SciQu not only predicts the properties of materials but also plays a key role in self-driving laboratories by optimizing the synthesis parameters to achieve precise shape, size, and phase of the materials subjected to the input parameters.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons with pentagonal nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with topological flat bands can serve as a promising platform to investigate strongly interacting phenomena. However, experimental realization of ideal flat bands is mostly limited to artificial lattices or moir\'e systems. Here we report a general way to construct one-dimensional (1D) flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with pentagonal nature: penta-hexa-PNRs and penta-dodeca-PNRs, wherein the corresponding flat bands are directly verified by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We confirm that the observed 1D flat bands originate from the electronic 1D sawtooth and Lieb lattices, respectively, as revealed by the combination of bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, tight-binding models, and first-principles calculations. Our study demonstrates a general way to construct 1D flat bands in 1D solid materials system, which provides a robust platform to explore strongly interacting phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Electric toroidal dipole order and hidden spin polarization in ferroaxial materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of electric toroidal dipoles in the prototypical ferroaxial materials NiTiO$_3$ and K$_2$Zr(PO$_4$)$_2$, which undergo ferroaxial structural phase transitions of order-disorder and displacive type, respectively. Using first-principles electronic structure theory, we compute the evolution across the ferroaxial transitions of the local electric toroidal dipole moments, defined both in terms of the vortices formed by local dipoles, as well as as the cross product of orbital and spin angular momenta. Our calculations confirm that the electric toroidal dipole acts as the order parameter for these ferroaxial transitions and highlight the importance of spin-orbit coupling in generating a non-zero atomic-site electric toroidal dipole moment. We find that, while the ferroaxial phases of NiTiO$_3$ and K$_2$Zr(PO$_4$)$_2$ preserve global inversion symmetry, they contain inversion-symmetry-broken sub-units that generate vortices of local electric dipole moments. In addition to causing the net electric toroidal dipole moment, these vortices induce a hidden spin polarization in the band structure.</description>

      <title>A chemical bond-based machine learning model for dipole moment: Application to dielectric properties of liquid methanol and ethanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile machine-learning scheme for predicting dipole moments of molecular liquids to study dielectric properties. We attribute the center of mass of Wannier functions, called Wannier centers, to each chemical bond and create neural network models that predict the Wannier centers for each chemical bond. Application to liquid methanol and ethanol shows that our neural network models successfully predict the dipole moment of various liquid configurations in close agreement with DFT calculations. We show that the dipole moment and dielectric constant in the liquids are greatly enhanced by the polarization of Wannier centers due to local intermolecular interactions. The calculated dielectric spectra agree well with experiments quantitatively over terahertz (THz) to infrared regions. Furthermore, we investigate the physical origin of THz absorption spectra of methanol, confirming the importance of translational and librational motions. Our method is applicable to other molecular liquids and can be widely used to study their dielectric properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires are believed to play a crucial role for future applications in electronics, spintronics and quantum technologies. A potential candidate is HgTe but its sensitivity to nanofabrication processes restrain its development. A way to circumvent this obstacle is the selective area growth technique. Here, in-plane HgTe nanostructures are grown thanks to selective area molecular beam epitaxy on a semi-insulating CdTe substrate covered with a patterned SiO$_{\mathrm{2}}$ mask. The shape of these nanostructures is defined by the in-plane orientation of the mask aperture along the &lt;$110$&gt;, &lt;$1\bar{\mathrm{1}}0$&gt;, or &lt;$100$&gt; direction, the deposited thickness, and the growth temperature. Several micron long in-plane nanowires can be achieved as well as more complex nanostructures such as networks, diamond structures or rings. A good selectivity is achieved with very little parasitic growth on the mask even for a growth temperature as low as $140${\deg}C and growth rate up to $0.5$ ML/s. For &lt;$110$&gt; oriented nanowires, the center of the nanostructure exhibits a trapezoidal shape with {$111$}B facets and two grains on the sides, while &lt;$1\bar{\mathrm{1}}0$&gt; oriented nanowires show {$111$}A facets with adatoms accumulation on the sides of the top surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal a continuous epitaxial relation between the CdTe substrate and the HgTe nanowire. Measurements of the resistance with fourpoint scanning tunneling microscopy indicates a good electrical homogeneity along the main NW axis and a thermally activated transport. This growth method paves the way toward the fabrication of complex HgTe-based nanostructures for electronic transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect of Nonlinear Optical Responses in Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics plays important roles in the research of fundamental physics and the applications of highperformance optoelectronic devices. The bulk nonlinear optical responses arise from the uniform light absorption in noncentrosymmetric crystals, and hence are usually considered to be the collective phenomena of all atoms. Here we show, in contrast to this common expectation, the nonlinear optical responses in antiferromagnets can be selectively accumulated near the surfaces, representing a skin effect. This is because the inversion symmetry, despite being broken globally, is barely violated locally deeply inside these antiferromagnets. Using A-type layered antiferromagnets as the representatives, we predict that the spatial-dependent nonlinear optical responses, such as bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and second harmonic generation (SHG), are notable in the top- and bottom-most layers and decay rapidly when moving away from the surfaces. Such a phenomenon exists in a broad range of antiferromagnets composed of centrosymmetric sublattices, offering promising device applications using these antiferromagnets. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked property of nonlinear optical responses and opens new opportunities for high-performance antiferromagnetic optospintronics.</description>

      <title>Breaking symmetry with light: photo-induced chirality in a non-chiral crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is a pervasive form of symmetry that is intimately connected to the physical properties of solids, as well as the chemical and biological activity of molecular systems. However, its control with light is challenging, because inducing chirality in a non-chiral material requires that all mirrors and all roto-inversions be simultaneously broken. Electromagnetic fields exert only oscillatory forces that vanish on average, mostly leading to entropy increase that does not break symmetries, per se. Here, we show that chirality of either handedness can be generated in the non-chiral piezoelectric material BPO$_4$, in which two compensated sub-structures of opposite handedness coexist within the same unit cell. By resonantly driving either one of two orthogonal, doubly degenerate vibrational modes at Terahertz frequency, we rectify the lattice distortion and exert a displacive force onto the crystal. The staggered chirality is in this way uncompensated in either direction, inducing chiral structure with either handedness. The rotary power of the photo-induced phases is comparable to the static value of prototypical chiral alpha-quartz, limited by the strength of the pump laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Formulation of Charged Defect in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect physics is at the heart of microelectronics. By keeping track of the reference energy in total energy calculations, we explicitly show that the "potential alignment" correction vanishes, and the classic Markov-Payne correction yields accurate results. From linear response theory, we further formulate an accurate expression for the quadrupole correction. Application to numerous defects including anisotropic material yields accurate formation energies in small supercells and the historically slow convergence of the 2+ diamond vacancy is shown to be a result of slow varying gap levels of the defect leading to a size dependent dielectric constant.</description>

      <title>Defect-Mediated Bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction in Ferromagnetic Multilayer Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in asymmetric multilayers is crucial for spintronics. However, it is also significant even in symmetric ones, and unveiling its atomic-level origin remains an issue. We use electron microscopy to propose defect-mediated bulk DMI in Pt/Co/Pt. We find an enhancement of the net DMI by increasing sputter gas pressure. The samples have a compositional gradient, but their compositional asymmetry is weak. Our analysis suggests that the asymmetric distribution of dislocations in the compositional gradient regions generates bulk DMI. Our results indicate the importance of bulk DMI in multilayers and could facilitate the development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Physical-chemical Approach for the Impact of Modifying Molecular Bridges of TPA-Based Systems to Improve the Photovoltaic Properties of Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical design of donor chromophores based on triphenylamine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (\textbf{DCRD-DCRD-2}) is proposed through structural adaptation with several molecular bridges derived from thiophene that can be used as new organic materials for organic solar cells (OSC). The optoelectronics properties and geometries of the \textbf{DCRD-DCRD-2} organic molecules are characterized using the B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP functional, with the basis set 6-31G(d,p). Consequently, the UV-Visible results revealed that a good relationship was found between the experimental values and the calculated using the DFT and TD-DFT level of theory. The study involved the prediction of photo-physical descriptors such as frontier molecular orbitals, ionization potential, electron affinity, molecular electrostatic potential, reorganization energy, open circuit voltage ($V_{oc}$), fill factor (FF), and short-circuit current ($J_{sc}$) in the ground state geometry, using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set. Structural tailoring with various molecular bridges resulted in a narrowing of the energy gap (2.130--1.96eV) with broader absorption spectra (525.55--417.69 nm). An effective charge transfer toward the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) was studied, which played a crucial role in conducting materials. \textbf{DCRD-2} exhibited $\lambda_{max}$ at $417.69$~nm in EtOH (ethanol) solvent with the lowest band gap (1.96 eV) and the lowest excitation energy of 2.968 eV. The highest mobility of holes and electrons is determined in all the designed molecules due to their low reorganization energy values that validated preferable photovoltaic properties in the \textbf{DCRD-1} molecular system.</description>

      <title>Local electrochemical characterization of active Mg-Fe materials: from pure Mg to Mg50-Fe composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the applicability of the scanning electrochemical nanocapillary (SEN) technique to characterize the local surface reactivity of active systems, such as Mg-based materials. Owing to its confined electrolyte configuration, one undeniable strength of the method is to provide with unprecedented resolution direct visualization and assessment of the presence, distribution and nobility of different phases. High lateral resolution open-circuit potential (OCP) scans on single Fe-rich particles in Mg confirms that these particles serve as local cathodes while evidencing enhanced surface activation at the interfacial area between the particle and the Mg matrix. Valuable insights about nanoscale galvanic coupling within an intermetallic particle can therefore be retrieved, which are otherwise not accessible. On more complex systems, such as Mg50-Fe composites, the SEN technique allows individual assessment of the reactivity of the different microscale phases. By combining OCP scans and local potentiodynamic polarization measurements, we reveal that changes in surface reactivity and stability of Mg-rich phases in these composites are directly correlated to their different microstructure, i.e. phase spacing and composition, which are intrinsically linked to their processing parameters. The SEN technique is therefore an excellent tool to help us refine our mechanistic understanding of initial stages of corrosion in heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>Superparamagnetic Tunnel Junctions for Reliable True Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic devices have the potential to disrupt computing, revolutionizing low-power machine learning acceleration, probabilistic computing, and hardware security. As implemented, however, superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) face significant challenges including the need for external magnetic fields, and poor reliability and scalability. Here, we present experimental demonstration of three-terminal sMTJs as scalable and reliable sources of true randomness under a field-free regime. By leveraging dual-current controllability and incorporating feedback systems, we substantially enhance the stability and reliability of sMTJ-based systems under varying conditions, even in the field-free regime. Our findings demonstrate the generation of cryptographic-quality random bitstreams and the practical use of sMTJs as efficient and reliable random number generators, successfully integrated into advanced computing algorithms like generative artificial intelligence. Field-free, truly random sMTJs promise to address critical challenges in cryptography, edge computing, and beyond, significantly advancing the field of random number generation.</description>

      <title>3D E-textile for Exercise Physiology and Clinical Maternal Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic textiles (E-textiles) offer great wearing comfort and unobtrusiveness, thus holding potential for next-generation health monitoring wearables. However, the practical implementation is hampered by challenges associated with poor signal quality, substantial motion artifacts, durability for long-term usage, and non-ideal user experience. Here, we report a cost-effective E-textile system that features 3D microfiber-based electrodes for greatly increasing the surface area. The soft and fluffy conductive microfibers disperse freely and securely adhere to the skin, achieving a low impedance at the electrode-skin interface even in the absence of gel. A superhydrophobic fluorinated self-assembled monolayer was deposited on the E-textile surface to render it waterproof while retaining the electrical conductivity. Equipped with a custom-designed motion-artifact canceling wireless data recording circuit, the E-textile system could be integrated into a variety of smart garments for exercise physiology and health monitoring applications. Real-time multimodal electrophysiological signal monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), was successfully carried out during strenuous cycling and even underwater swimming activities. Furthermore, a multi-channel E-textile was developed and implemented in clinical patient studies for simultaneous real-time monitoring of maternal ECG and uterine EMG signals, incorporating spatial-temporal potential mapping capabilities.</description>

      <title>General Electronic Structure Calculation Method for Twisted Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, two-dimensional twisted systems have gained increasing attention. However, the calculation of electronic structures in twisted material has remained a challenge. To address this, we have developed a general computational methodology that can generate twisted geometries starting from monolayer structure and obtain the precisely relaxed twisted structure through a machine learning-based method. Then the electronic structure properties of the twisted material are calculated using tight-Binding (TB) and continuum model methods, thus the entire process requires minimal computational resources. In this paper, we first introduce the theoretical methods for generating twisted structures and computing their electronic properties. We then provide calculations and brief analyses of the electronic structure properties for several typical two-dimensional materials with different characteristics. This work serves as a solid foundation for researchers interested in studying twisted systems.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of measured dependencies of strength of spin-orbit interaction and anisotropy field on current density in FeCoB nanomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the strength of spin-orbit interaction by an electrical current in nanomagnets. Our systematic study explores the current dependencies of these properties across a variety of nanomagnets with different structures, compositions, and sizes, providing unprecedented insights into the complex physical origins of this effect. We identified two distinct contributions to the observed current modulation: one proportional to the current and the other to the square of the current. The squared-current contribution, originating from the Spin Hall effect, uniquely accumulates strength with an increasing number of interfaces, resulting in exceptionally large current modulation of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction in multi-layer nanomagnets. Conversely, the linear-current contribution stems from the Ordinary and Anomalous Hall effects and exhibits opposite polarity at different interfaces, making it significant only in asymmetrical single-layer nanomagnets. The squared-current contribution induces substantial anisotropy field changes, up to 30-50$\%$ at typical MRAM recording currents, leading to thermally-activated magnetization reversal and data recording. The linear-current contribution, while smaller, is effective for parametric magnetization reversal, providing sufficient modulation for efficient data recording through resonance mechanisms. This finding highlights the complex nature of spin accumulation and spin dynamics at the nanoscale, presenting an opportunity for further optimization of data recording in MRAM technology.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum engineering of current flow in carbon nanostructures at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesis enables the fabrication of carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. Good examples are graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), 1D conjugated polymers, and nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), which are gathering increasing attention for future carbon nanoelectronics. A key step is the ability to manipulate current flow within these nanomaterials. Destructive quantum interference (QI), long studied in the field of single-molecule electronics, has been proposed as the most effective way to achieve such control with molecular-scale precision. However, for practical applications, it is essential that such QI-engineering remains effective near or above room temperature. To assess this important point, here we combine large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and quantum transport calculations and focus our study on NPGs formed as arrays of laterally bonded GNRs. By considering various NPGs with different inter-GNR chemical connections we disentangle the different factors determining electronic transport in these carbon nanomaterials at 300 K. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that QI survives at room temperature, with thermal vibrations weakly restricting current flow along GNRs while completely blocking transport across GNRs. Our results thus pave the way towards the future realization of QI-engineered carbon nanocircuitry operating at room temperature, which is a fundamental step towards carbon-based nanoelectronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ogden model is often considered as a standard model in the literature for application to the deformation of brain tissue. Here we show that, in some of those applications, the use of the Ogden model leads to non-convexity of the strain-energy function and mis-prediction of the correct concavity of the experimental stress-stretch curves over a range of the deformation domain. By contrast, we propose a family of models which provides a favourable fit to the considered datasets while remaining free from the highlighted shortcomings of the Ogden model. While, as we discuss, those shortcomings might be due to the artefacts of the testing protocols, the proposed family of models proves impervious to such artefacts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy of single-crystalline LiVO$_2$ exhibiting transition to a diamagnetic state below $T_c \sim $500K are reported. Our measurements clearly detect additional peaks in the low-temperature phase, which disappear nearly completely when heated above $T_c$. Proposed $\sqrt{3}$a \times $\sqrt{3}$a lattice reconstruction explains these new Raman peaks by the Brillouin zone folding. The experiment, on the one hand, confirms that the symmetry of the non-magnetic phase is not lower than trigonal, but, on another hand, our thermal cycling study suggests possible stacking faults. This agrees with results of the density functional theory calculations, which show that the energy difference between different types of stacking does not exceed 1 K per formula unit.</description>

      <title>Selected Configuration Interaction for Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states that can decay by electron loss. They are ubiquitous across various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. However, current theoretical and computational models for resonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state methodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to treat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By modifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard SCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full configuration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of \ce{N2-} and \ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation, which shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \SI{0.1}{\eV}. The present CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of highly-accurate methodologies for resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are metallic due to self-doping. And the ML also shows features of heavy fermions, which indicates that there may be Kondo physics in 1313-La327. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (La4310). The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL (TL-outer Ni) show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of RE2O2CO3 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb) with a rare earth-bilayer of triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycrystalline samples of RE2O2CO3 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb) with a unique rare-earth bilayer of triangular lattice were synthesized and studied by DC and AC magnetic susceptibility. Data reveals various magnetic ground states including (i) a nonmagnetic ground state for the Pr sample; (ii) long range magnetic ordering for the Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er samples. Besides the Gd sample, they exhibit field-induced spin state transitions. More interestingly, the series spin state transitions in the Nd and Dy samples could be attributed to the field-induced up-up-down (UUD) spin structure. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) measurements of the Er sample suggest a spiral spin structure below its TN; and (iii) a short-range ordering for the Yb sample. The disrupted inter-layer interaction due to the shift of Yb3+ ions within the bilayer prevents long range magnetic ordering down to 30 mK and makes it another Yb-related triangular lattice antiferromagnet that has the potential to realize a quantum spin liquid state.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in graph neural networks show promise for predicting the occurrence of abnormal grain growth, which has been a particularly challenging area of research due to its apparent stochastic nature. In this study, we generate a large dataset of Monte Carlo simulations of abnormal grain growth. We train simple graph convolution networks to predict which initial microstructures will exhibit abnormal grain growth, and compare the results to a standard computer vision approach for the same task. The graph neural network outperformed the computer vision method and achieved 73% prediction accuracy and fewer false positives. It also provided some physical insight into feature importance and the relevant length scale required to maximize predictive performance. Analysis of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulations provides additional insights for ongoing work in this area.</description>

      <title>Group Theory on Quasisymmetry and Protected Near Degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solid state systems, group representation theory is powerful in characterizing the behavior of quasiparticles, notably the energy degeneracy. While conventional group theory is effective in answering yes-or-no questions related to symmetry breaking, its application to determining the magnitude of energy splitting resulting from symmetry lowering is limited. Here, we propose a theory on quasisymmetry and near degeneracy, thereby expanding the applicability of group theory to address questions regarding large-or-small energy splitting. Defined within the degenerate subspace of an unperturbed Hamiltonian, quasisymmetries form an enlarged symmetry group eliminating the first-order splitting. This framework ensures that the magnitude of splitting arises as a second-order effect of symmetry-lowering perturbations, such as external fields and spin-orbit coupling. We systematically tabulate the quasisymmetry groups within 32 crystallographic point groups and find all the possible unitary quasisymmetry group structures regarding double degeneracy. Applying our theory to the realistic material AgLa, we predict a "quasi-Dirac semimetal" phase characterized by two tiny-gap band anticrossings.</description>

Abstract: In this short review, we provide an overview of recent progress in deploying advanced characterization techniques to understand the effects of local inhomogeneities in moir\'e heterostructures over multiple length scales. Particular emphasis is placed on correlating the impact of twist angle misalignment, nano-scale disorder, and atomic relaxation on the moir\'e potential and its collective excitations, particularly moir\'e excitons.

      <description>arXiv:2403.06304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of magnetic topological insulators is instrumental in exploring axion electrodynamics and intriguing transport phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report that a family of magnetic compounds Eu$_{2n+1}$In$_{2}$(As,Sb)$_{2n+2}$ ($n=0,1,2$) exhibit both gapless Dirac surface states and chiral hinge modes. Such a hybrid-order topology hatches surface-dependent quantum geometry. By mapping the responses into real space, we demonstrate the existence of chiral hinge modes along the $c$ direction, which originate from the half-quantized anomalous Hall effect on two gapped $ac$/$bc$ facets due to Berry curvature, while the unpinned Dirac surface states on the gapless $ab$ facet generate an intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall effect due to the quantum metric. When Eu$_{3}$In$_{2}$As$_{4}$ is polarized to the ferromagnetic phase by an external magnetic field, it becomes an ideal Weyl semimetal with a single pair of type-I Weyl points and no extra Fermi pocket. Our work predicts rich topological states sensitive to magnetic structures, quantum geometry-induced transport and topological superconductivity if proximitized with a superconductor.</description>

      <title>Dielectric response in twisted MoS2 bilayer facilitated by spin-orbit coupling effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phonon inverse Faraday effect describes the emergence of a DC magnetization due to circularly polarized phonons. In this work we present a microscopic formalism for the phonon inverse Faraday effect. The formalism is based on time-dependent second order perturbation theory and electron phonon coupling. While our final equation is general and material independent, we provide estimates for the effective magnetic field expected for the ferroelectric soft mode in the oxide perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Our estimates are consistent with recent experiments showing a huge magnetization after a coherent excitation of circularly polarized phonons with THz laser light. Hence, the theoretical approach presented here is promising for shedding light into the microscopic mechanism of angular momentum transfer between ionic and electronic angular momentum, which is expected to play a central role in the phononic manipulation of magnetism.</description>

Abstract: We present electrical and thermal transport measurements in single crystals of the metallic oxide RuO$_2$. The resistivity and Seebeck coefficient measured up to 970K confirm the metallic nature of transport. Magnetoresistance and Hall effect measurements as a function of orientation can be most easily described by a multiband transport model. We find that the ordinary Hall effect dominates any anomalous Hall signal in single crystals.</description>

      <title>Scanning acoustic microscopy characterization of cold sprayed coatings deposited on grooved substrates</title>

Abstract: The effect of non-planar substrate surface on homogeneity and quality of cold sprayed (CS) deposits was studied by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Fe coatings were cold sprayed onto Al substrates containing artificially introduced grooves of square- and trapezoid-shaped geometries, with flat or cylindrical bottoms. The Al substrates were either wrought or cold sprayed, to comprehend their prospective influence on the Fe coatings build-up. SAM was then used to assess morphological properties of the materials from the cross-view and top-view directions. The microstructure below the surface of the studied samples was visualized by measuring the amplitudes of the reflection echoes and the velocity of the ultrasonic waves. The SAM analysis revealed that the regions of coating imperfections around the grooves are larger than what is suggested by standard scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Furthermore, we found that the seemingly non-influenced coating regions that appear perfectly homogeneous and dense in SEM do, in fact, possess heterogeneous microstructure associated with the individual CS nozzle passes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bernal-Fowler ice rules stipulate that each water molecule in an ice crystal should form four hydrogen bonds. However, in extreme or constrained conditions, the arrangement of water molecules deviates from conventional ice rules, resulting in properties significantly different from bulk water. In this study, we employ machine learning-driven first-principles simulations to identify a new stabilization mechanism in nanoconfined ice phases beyond conventional ice rules. Instead of forming four hydrogen bonds, nanoconfined crystalline ice can form a quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure that exhibits only two hydrogen bonds per water molecule. These structures consist of strongly hydrogen-bonded linear chains of water molecules that zig-zag along one dimension, stabilized by van der Waals interactions that stack these chains along the other dimension. The unusual interplay of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in nanoconfined ice results in atypical proton behavior such as potential ferroelectric behavior, low dielectric response, and long-range proton dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In the pursuit of scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic devices, recent research has unveiled a novel category of spiking oscillators, termed "thermal neuristors." These devices function via thermal interactions among neighboring vanadium dioxide resistive memories, emulating biological neuronal behavior. Here, we show that the collective dynamical behavior of networks of these neurons showcases a rich phase structure, tunable by adjusting the thermal coupling and input voltage. Notably, we identify phases exhibiting long-range order that, however, does not arise from criticality, but rather from the time non-local response of the system. In addition, we show that these thermal neuristor arrays achieve high accuracy in image recognition and time series prediction through reservoir computing, without leveraging long-range order. Our findings highlight a crucial aspect of neuromorphic computing with possible implications on the functioning of the brain: criticality may not be necessary for the efficient performance of neuromorphic systems in certain computational tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian line graph: A generalized approach to flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) in materials can enhance the correlation effects, resulting in exotic phenomena. Line graph (LG) lattices are well known for hosting FBs with isotropic hoppings in $s$-orbital models. Despite their prevalent application in the Kagome metals, there has been a lack of a general approach for incorporating higher-angular-momentum orbitals with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) into LGs to achieve FBs. Here, we introduce a non-Abelian LG theory to construct FBs in realistic systems, which incorporates internal degrees of freedom and goes beyond $s$-orbital models. We modify the lattice edges and sites in the LG to be associated with arbitrary Hermitian matrices, referred to as the multiple LG. A fundamental aspect involves mapping the multiple LG Hamiltonian to a tight-binding (TB) model that respects the lattice symmetry through appropriate local non-Abelian transformations. We establish the general conditions to determine the local transformations. Based on this mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of $d$-orbital FBs in the Kagome lattice, which could serve as a minimal model for understanding the FBs in transition metal Kagome materials. Our approach bridges the gap between the known FBs in pure lattice models and their realization in multi-orbital systems.</description>

      <title>Search for inhomogeneous Meissner screening in Nb induced by low-temperature surface treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical surface treatments, such as low-temperature baking (LTB) in a gaseous atmosphere or in vacuum, are important for the surface preparation of Nb superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. These treatments inhomogeneously dope the first $\sim$50 nm of Nb's subsurface and are expected to impart depth-dependent characteristics to its Meissner response; however, direct evidence supporting this remains elusive, suggesting the effect is subtle. In this work, we revisit the Meissner profile data for several LTB treatments obtained from low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mu$SR) experiments [A. Romanenko et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 072601 (2014) and R. M. L. McFadden et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 044018 (2023)], and search for signatures of inhomogeneous field screening. Using a generalized London expression with a recently proposed empirical model for a depth-dependent magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(z)$, we obtain improved fits to the Meissner data, revealing that the presence of a non-superconducting surface "dead layer" $d \geq 25$ nm is a strong indicator of a reduced supercurrent density at shallow subsurface depths. Our analysis supports the notion that vacuum annealing at 120 $^{\circ}$C for 48 h induces a depth-dependent Meissner response, which has consequences for Nb's ability to maintain a magnetic-flux-free state. Evidence of similar behavior from a "nitrogen infusion" treatment is less compelling. Suggestions for further investigation into the matter are provided.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Crystallization and Phase Transition of Niobium Dioxide Thin-Films for Neuromorphic Computing Applications Using a Tube Furnace Optical Transmission System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant research has focused on low-power stochastic devices built from memristive materials. These devices foster neuromorphic approaches to computational efficiency enhancement in merged biomimetic and CMOS architectures due to their ability to phase transition from a dielectric to a metal at an increased temperature. Niobium dioxide has a volatile memristive phase change that occurs $\sim$800$^\circ$C~that makes it an ideal candidate for future neuromorphic electronics. A straightforward optical system has been developed on a horizontal tube furnace for \emph{in situ} spectral measurements as an as-grown \NbtOf\ film is annealed and ultimately crystallizes as \NbOt. The system measures the changing spectral transmissivity of \NbtOf\ as it undergoes both reduction and crystallization processes. We were also able to measure the transition from metallic-to-non-metallic \NbOt\ during the cooldown phase, which is shown to occur about 100$^\circ$C~ lower on a sapphire substrate than fused silica. After annealing, the material properties of the \NbtOf\ and \NbOt\ were assessed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and 4-point resistivity, confirming that we have made crystalline \NbOt.</description>
