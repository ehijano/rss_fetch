      <title>Lattice Schwinger Model and Spacetime Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions under the influence of spin-dependent Rydberg molecular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.</description>

      <title>Boson-Gutzwiller Quantum liquids on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional, interacting spinless bosons on a tight-binding lattice described by the Bose-Hubbard model. Besides attractive on-site two-body interactions, we include a three-body repulsive term such that the competition between these two forces allows the formation of self-bound liquid states. We investigate the properties of this system using the Gutzwiller approximation, showing that, indeed, this mean-field approach also supports liquid states. We find that for densities lower than the equilibrium density, the Gutzwiller method, and other mean-field approaches -- such as the Gross-Pitaevskii theory -- feature a sharp transition to the vacuum state. This, however, is avoided by considering local minima of the functional in the standard manner. We also study the excitation spectrum, and calculate the speed of sound, in full agreement with the usual expression obtained from the thermodynamic equation of state. We study their corresponding quantum droplets variationally and find that the results behave in accordance with the one-dimensional liquid drop model.</description>

      <title>Giant vortex in a harmonically-trapped rotating dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of dynamically stable giant vortices in a harmonically-trapped strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy Bose-Einstein condensate under rotation around the polarization direction of dipolar atoms, employing the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high atom density. These giant vortices are stationary, obtainable by imaginary-time propagation using a Gaussian initial state, while the appropriate phase of the giant vortex is imprinted on the initial wave function. The dynamical stability of the giant vortices is established by real-time propagation during a long interval of time after a small change of a parameter.</description>

      <title>Fractional-flux oscillations of Josephson critical currents in multi-gap superconductors: a test for unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson-junction interferometry has played a pivotal role in uncovering unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates. Using a Ginzburg-Landau-like approach, we generalize previous results to the genuine multi-gap case. Thus, we show that fractional flux oscillations of the Josephson critical current can arise as a direct consequence of multi-gap superconductivity. These oscillations reveal key information about the underlying superconducting states, including the unconventional $s_\pm$-wave state. Thus, our findings suggest new phase-sensitive experiments to characterize the Cooper pairing of new emerging superconductors such as the nickelates.</description>

      <title>Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. That significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states and is responsible for an unconventional form of transport. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport; counterintuitively, quantum many-body scars are completely irrelevant for the aforementioned mechanism. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Stationary states in a very strongly dipolar molecular condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy condensate of dipolar length $a_{\mathrm{dd}}=130.8a_0$, with $a_0$ the Bohr radius, hosts a wide variety of eigenstates, such as droplet, droplet-lattice, and ring-topology states, and self-bound droplets. Motivated by the observation of a very strongly dipolar condensate of NaCs molecules [Bigagli N et al. 2024 Nature 631 289], we demonstrate by numerical simulation, using an improved mean-field model, including the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, that in a very strongly dipolar molecular condensate with $a_{\mathrm{dd}} = 2000a_0$, most of the above-mentioned states continue to exist and can appear for a much smaller number $N$ of particles ($N \lessapprox 1000$) within the present experimental possibility. However, in a harmonically-trapped very strongly dipolar rotating molecular condensate, a new type of $L=2$ giant-vortex state, with a phase drop of $2 \pi L$ along a closed path around the axis of rotation, appear, where $L$ is the angular momentum of the vortex.</description>
