      <title>Thermal noise squeezing and amplification in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we propose several methods with increasing precision for analytically estimating white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. The analytical model is based on obtaining the response of the resonator to the added noise using Green's function. The response consists of three parts: elastic, down, and up parametric conversions. We obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method or exactly, in principle, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonator response to added noise. Furthermore, we observe that the squeezing effects occur only at half the parametric pump frequency. Due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning around resonance near the instability threshold. Additionally, we validate some of our theoretical predictions of squeezing with the results obtained from the numerical integration of the stochastic differential equations of our model. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a pair of coupled parametric and harmonic resonators with a single noise input. The results obtained from Floquet theory can be applied generally to coupled</description>

      <title>Nonlocally coupled moisture model for convective self-aggregation</title>

Abstract: Clouds play a central role in climate physics by interacting with precipitation, radiation, and circulation. Although the self-aggregation of clouds is a fundamental problem in convective organization, a theoretical explanation of how it occurs has not been established owing to its complexity. Here, we introduce an idealized mathematical model of the phenomenon in which the state of the system is represented solely by the atmospheric columns' vertically integrated water vapor content. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of this simplified system, we mathematically elucidated the mechanisms that determine the onset of self-aggregation and the spatial scale of the self-aggregated state. Nonlocal coupling between atmospheric columns makes the system bistable with dry and moist equilibria, reflecting the effect of circulation driven by horizontal differential heating due to convection and radiation. The bistable self-aggregated state is realized when destabilization by nonlocal coupling triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances in the uniform state overwhelms the stabilization by diffusion. For globally coupled systems in which all the columns are equally coupled, the perturbation of the maximum wavelength has the maximum growth rate. A solution with an infinitely long wavelength exists, which can be understood as the dynamical system's heteroclinic trajectories describing the steady state's spatial evolution. In contrast, for nonlocally coupled systems with finite filter lengths, perturbation of the wavelength close to the characteristic length of the coupling is preferred. The results revealed that the balance between nonlocal coupling and diffusion is essential for understanding convective self-aggregation.</description>

      <title>Stable developmental patterns of gene expression without morphogen gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene expression patterns (GEPs) are established by cross-regulating target genes that interpret morphogen gradients. However, as development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent GEP without stabilizing positional cues. The GEP then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically noisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. However, the established GEPs remain spatio-temporally stable in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a GEP is maintained without morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that fine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level increases temporal stability of GEPs by orders of magnitude, providing stability over developmentally relevant times, without morphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameter regime closely agrees with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics of GEP asymmetry factors, we trace back the pattern stability enhancement to the emergence of a metastable basin and restoring forces that counteract pattern perturbations. The origin of these forces is further explained by the effective model, describing the emergent deterministic dynamics of the system. Altogether, we show that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic GEPs even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.</description>
