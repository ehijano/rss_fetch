      <title>Kurt G\"odel and the Logic of Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05442v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature dealing with G\"{o}del's legacy is largely preoccupied with challenging his philosophical views, regarding them as outdated. We believe that such an approach prevents us from seeing G\"{o}del's views in the right light and understanding their rationale. In this article, his views are discussed in the philosophical realm in which he himself understood them. We explore the consequences of G\"{o}del's incompleteness theorems for the question of the objectivity of mathematics and its epistemology. Taking set theory as the paradigm of formal mathematical theories, we examine the relationship between its incompleteness and extensionality. We argue, based on his philosophical views, that G\"{o}del believed incompleteness can be overcome only by some intensional considerations about concepts from the basis of mathematical theories. These considerations should eventually lead to founding the so-called logic of concepts.</description>

      <title>Singularity: a Seventh Memo?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the relationships between Calvino's memos and Mathematics. In the first part, we discuss how Lightness, Quickness, Exactitude, Visibility, Multiplicity are present in the mathematical language, reasoning and in the work of the mathematician. In addiction, we follow a similar path for the topics of Calvino's lecture of which we only know the title or some notes. In the final part, we explain why `Singularity' could be chosen as topic for Calvino's seventh lecture.</description>
