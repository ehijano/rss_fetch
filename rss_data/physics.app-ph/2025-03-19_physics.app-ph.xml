      <title>Near-zero Temperature Coefficient of Resistance for a Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Polymer Nanocomposite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature dependence of electrical resistance of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs)/epoxy nanocomposites, which is characterized by a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), is experimentally investigated. In the existing literature, there are biased TCR values with non-monotonic temperature dependence, including both negative and positive values. In this study, we demonstrate that the influence of environment temperature can be greatly minimized by ensuring the CNT/epoxy nanocomposite is fully cured along with controlling CNT concentration and selecting an appropriate polymer matrix. In addition, agglomeration of CNTs significantly influences the performance of CNT/polymer nanocomposites. Resistance values remained nearly constant at a CNT concentration of approximately 1 wt.% below the glass transition temperature. It is also observed that in a fully cured CNT/epoxy nanocomposite with the microscale conductive pathway as the main conductance mechanism, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the matrix is a critical characteristic, resulting in a consistent increasing trend in TCR.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Cure Monitoring via Carbon Nanotube Networks Enables Mechanical Property Optimization in Post-Cured Epoxy Resins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-enabled real-time monitoring system to optimize post-curing conditions (temperature and duration) for epoxy resin. This method can serve as an alternative to traditional methods like Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), which is effective in measuring the degree of cure in polymers during industrial curing (manufacturer-recommended cure cycle). Two different programs using SWCNTs were employed to design the cure cycles for investigating the development of mechanical properties: Program A as the comparison of effects of varied duration of high-temperature curing and Program B as high-temperature curing followed by the varied duration of low-temperature post-curing. By correlating variation in the electrical resistance of SWCNT with curing stages, we illustrate that extending post-curing at 100{\deg}C for 24 hours after an initial 3-hour cure at 130{\deg}C increases tensile strength by 60% and elongation by 164% compared to industry standards. This approach not only improves mechanical performance but also enables precise, non-destructive cure-state detection, offering a scalable solution for high-performance composites in the aerospace and automotive sectors.</description>

      <title>The effect of variable fibre diameters in unidirectional fibre-reinforced bundles on stress redistributions around fibre breaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element modelling is conducted to simulate the stress redistribution around a broken fibre (BF) in a bundle with experimentally measured fibre diameter distributions (FDD), followed by a parametric study of the influence of the FDD coefficient of variation on the stress concentration factor (SCF) and ineffective length (IL). Two variants of the SCF definition are considered: based on average and maximum stress in the fibre cross-section. Results demonstrate that bigger fibre diameters show higher SCF and clustering of such fibres increases SCF in nearest neighbour fibres (NNFs). Critically, maximum stress-based SCF (maxSCF_max) significantly exceeds average stress-based SCF (maxSCF_avg), with differences about 40 to 75% in NNFs for FDD bundles compared to FCD bundles. This emphasises the necessity of prioritizing maximum stress criteria over conventional average stress models in failure predictions. The findings challenge benchmark models that rely on averaged SCF values, offering critical insights for improving accuracy in predicting fibre break propagation and composite strength.</description>

      <title>Embedding 1D BDI topological models into continuous elastic plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional mechanical topological metamaterials belonging to the BDI symmetry class (that is, preserving time-reversal, chiral, and particle-hole symmetries) have been realized in discrete systems by exploiting arrangements of either masses and springs or acoustic resonators. This study presents an approach to embed one-dimensional BDI class metamaterials into fully continuous elastic two-dimensional waveguides. The design leverages the concept of evanescently coupled waveguides and defect resonances in order to reproduce the equivalent dynamics of prototypical BDI systems, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Starting with a continuous plate waveguide with a periodic distribution of pillars, resonant waveguides and local defects are created by either eliminating or by properly adjusting the height of selected pillars. The approach is validated by designing fully continuous elastic analogs of the SSH model and the dual SSH model. Numerical simulations confirm the emergence of topological edge modes at the interface of topologically distinct systems. In addition, edge modes in the elastic analog of the dual SSH model are shown to be Majorana-like modes.</description>

      <title>Polymer Matrix Sand Composites for Enhanced Ballistic Impact Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing threat of ballistic impact, it is crucial to provide a solution that is not only effective but also economical. A majority of studies contribute toward alternatives to monolithic structures by incorporating sandwiched cores, which are often prone to crushing and delamination. In recent years, sand-based composites have emerged as a potentially cost-effective solution. In this ongoing effort, the current research aims to offer robust protection against ballistic impacts and ballistic threats. This research investigates the enhancement of ballistic impact resistance in Polymer Matrix Sand Composites (PMSCs) through the inclusion of sand in a graded fashion, resulting in a tunable solution. The tailoring of various mechanical properties, such as modulus, impact strength, and hardness, enables different layers within a single structure, offering potential advantages as the projectile pierces through the thickness. The gradation creates a stepwise structure, with a base impact zone densely graded that is brittle and hard enough to erode the projectile. Further gradation involves a less dense region providing tensile strength, which can reflect the tensile wave and reduce impact energy. In the preceding study, composites underwent Experimental testing to evaluate mechanical properties. Homogenized properties were extracted to assess PMSCs' behavior under varying constituents. The current study utilizes extracted properties to develop layered structures. Simulation studies of varied gradation configurations are conducted, and the potential advantages of layering sequences are studied. Preliminary projectile impact studies provide initial insights into gradation performance. Results show that size and volume fraction significantly impact mechanical properties and ballistic resistance, highlighting PMSCs as cost-effective, sustainable materials for advanced protection.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Analysis of Li-ion Battery Degradation: Integrating Optical Fiber Sensing with Differential State of Health Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability and safety of Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are of great concern in the energy storage industry. Nevertheless, the real-time monitoring of their degradation remains challenging due to limited quantitative metrics available during cycling. This study addresses this limitation by employing a novel approach that combines external optical fiber sensing with advanced data analysis techniques to comprehensively assess battery health. We engineered a non-invasive optical sensing platform using tandem pairs of polymeric and silica-based fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed to the external surface of commercial Li-ion button cells, enabling simultaneous, real-time monitoring of device-level volume changes and thermal events over 600 cycles. Our analysis incorporated differential techniques to estimate the battery's state of health (SOH) based on capacity, strain, and temperature variations with respect to voltage. Additionally, we implemented and compared three deep learning models - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - to predict battery SOH over cycles. We were able to capture both continuous and spontaneous degradation events and provide unique insights into battery behavior across its lifecycle through differential analysis and new SOH metrics demonstrating high correlation with conventional measures. This multi-parameter approach, combining advanced sensing techniques with innovative data analysis and deep learning methods, contributes significantly to battery diagnostics, potentially improving reliability assessment, enhancing safety standards, and accelerating the development of more sustainable energy storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Tunnel Junction Based on above-Room-Temperature Altermagnetic CrSb, Ferroelectric In2Se3 and Ferromagnetic Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered profound fascination. Their idiosyncratic electronic structures facilitate spintronics and electronics, yet room-temperature (RT) AM-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with versatile tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and tunneling electroresistance (TER) regulated by multiferroics remain uncharted frontiers. We herein construct an experiment-fabricable above-RT MTJ, comprising altermagnetic metal/ferroelectric barrier/magnetic metal epitomized by CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2. Magnetism- (Ferroelectricity-) manipulatable TER (TMR) and both approaches-controllable spin filtering are attained. Non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and vacuum layer are exploited as counterpoints to discern the roles of ferroelectric and tangible barrier, respectively. High TMR, TER and spin filtering efficiency of 1031/2308 %, 328 % and ~100 % (near-perfect) can be accomplished, respectively. Our results of the initial investigation for above-RT multiferroic AM-based MTJs avail the evolution of advanced spin transport, sensing and logic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Theoretical Investigation of Multi-Beam Interference and Cavity Resonance in Top-Emission QLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Top-emission quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been extensively studied due to their potential application in augmented/virtual reality. Particularly, the impact of Fabry-P\'erot resonance on top-emission QLEDs has been investigated through both experimental and theoretical studies. Additionally, multi-beam interference effects in QLED emission layers have been explored theoretically. However, previous studies predominantly rely on simplified simulations or governing equations with minor numerical corrections, often resulting in discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results. Notably, a comprehensive investigation of multi-beam interference effects remains insufficient.
  This study aims to perform a theoretical analysis of multi-beam interference, substantiated with numerical simulations. Specifically, we examine Fabry-P\'erot resonance effects and compare them with interference between upward and downward emission components in QLED layers. The findings are expected to provide insights into designing more efficient QLED architectures.</description>

      <title>Broadband Angular-selective Mid-infrared Photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared photodetectors are susceptible to background noise since every object in the surroundings emits thermal radiation from different directions. To reduce this background noise and enhance signal-to-noise ratio of mid-infrared sensing, different strategies to achieve angular-selective filtering have been proposed. However, these methods are either wavelength- and polarization-dependent, or require bulky lens or mirror systems. The former compromises the photodetector sensitivity, and the latter makes it difficult to integrate with wearable or on-chip devices. In this study, we present a novel angular-selective microstructure array that can seamlessly integrate onto a mid-infrared photodetector. Our compact device leverages the conservation of etendue to attain high angular selectivity over a broad range of mid-infrared wavelengths. Radiation from unwanted angles is substantially filtered, which leads to a markedly enhanced photodetection signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the device's photoresponse is shown to be polarization- and wavelength-independent, avoiding signal losses associated with narrow spectral ranges or polarization dependence, and therefore circumventing degradation in photodetector sensitivity. Our broadband angular-selective mid-infrared photodetector holds great promise for wearable devices, medical diagnostics and space applications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Integrated Modeling of Thermal Properties and Relaxation Dynamics in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are a promising class of materials celebrated for their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, accurately predicting and understanding the melting temperature (T_m) and glass transition temperature (T_g) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that integrates machine learning (ML) models with theoretical methods to predict and analyze these key thermal properties in metallic glasses. Our ML models using distributional data derived from elemental composition-based features obtain high accuracy while minimizing data preprocessing complexity. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between T_m and T_g to elucidate their dependence on alloy composition and thermodynamic behavior. When the T_g value of metallic glasses is known, further analysis using the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory provides a deeper understanding of structural relaxation dynamics. This integrated framework establishes a quantitative description consistent with experimental data and previous works and paves the way for the efficient design and discovery of advanced materials with tailored thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Performance Limits in Current-Matched Tandem Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem solar cells are at the forefront of extending the efficiency limits of solar cell technology. Among two-terminal tandems, current-matched (CM) tandem solar cells are of particular interest, owing to their relative ease of fabrication. Though CM tandems have been extensively studied, an analytical framework based on the detailed balance for N-layer CM tandems with area de-coupled subcells has not been addressed. Current matching constraints can be alleviated with the appropriate addition of area de-coupled subcells/modules at each layer. In this work, we propose an analytical framework for modeling the performance limits of an N-layer CM tandem solar cell with subcells across layers. Radiative coupling among cells is taken into account. Analytical expressions for the optimal number of subcells across layers are presented. Additionally, we investigate the impact of bandgap mismatches on efficiency, a critical factor in real-world fabrication due to material and processing variations, demonstrating that subcells enhance robustness against such imperfections. Our work provides useful design guidelines for designing and estimating the performance limits of advanced solar cell architectures and can be extended to voltage-matched and bifacial devices as well.</description>

      <title>On the role of geometric phase in the dynamics of elastic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric phase provides important mathematical insights to understand the fundamental nature and evolution of the dynamic response in a wide spectrum of systems ranging from quantum to classical mechanics. While the concept of geometric phase, which is an additional phase factor occurring in dynamical systems, holds the same meaning across different fields of application, its use and interpretation can acquire important nuances specific to the system of interest. In recent years, the development of quantum topological materials and its extension to classical mechanical systems have renewed the interest in the concept of geometric phase. This review revisits the concept of geometric phase and discusses, by means of either established or original results, its critical role in the design and dynamic behavior of elastic waveguides. Concepts of differential geometry and topology are put forward to provide a theoretical understanding of the geometric phase and its connection to the physical properties of the system. Then, the concept of geometric phase is applied to different types of elastic waveguides to explain how either topologically trivial or non-trivial behavior can emerge based on the geometric features of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Superdirective and Superabsorptive Aperiodic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general theory of aperiodic subwavelength arrays for controlling electromagnetic waves. The considered platform is formed by an array of electrically small loaded scatterers above a ground plane. While the array is geometrically periodic, all the loads can be in general different, so that the distributions of currents induced by plane waves are not periodic. To allow analytical solutions, we study arrays of thin wires or strips loaded by bulk loads. We demonstrate a practical way of creating tunable and reconfigurable multifunctional devices, on examples of superdirective beam splitters, focusing lenses establishing subdiffraction focusing, and absorbers going beyond perfect absorption. Contrary to the constraints imposed by the Floquet theorem in periodic counterparts like periodic metasurfaces or metagratings, where a fixed angle of incidence and period dictate the propagating directions of reflected waves, the proposed aperiodic designs allow controlling all propagating modes in any direction, which provides more freedom in manipulating electromagnetic waves. We hope that these results can be useful in multiple applications, such as telecommunications, radar techniques, signal processing, and energy harnessing.</description>

      <title>Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: direct approach via master diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting material, exhibits complex, anisotropic diffusional characteristics and mass transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments, highlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion mechanisms.</description>
