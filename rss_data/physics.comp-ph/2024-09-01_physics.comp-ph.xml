      <title>SOLAX: A Python solver for fermionic quantum systems with neural network support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of fermionic many-body quantum systems presents similar challenges across various research domains, necessitating universal tools, including state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Here, we introduce SOLAX, a Python library designed to compute and analyze fermionic quantum systems using the formalism of second quantization. SOLAX provides a modular framework for constructing and manipulating basis sets, quantum states, and operators, facilitating the simulation of electronic structures and determining many-body quantum states in finite-size Hilbert spaces. The library integrates machine learning capabilities to mitigate the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimensions in large quantum clusters. The core low-level functionalities are implemented using the recently developed Python library JAX. Demonstrated through its application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model, SOLAX offers a flexible and powerful tool for researchers addressing the challenges of many-body quantum systems across a broad spectrum of fields, including atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonlinear System with Machine Learning: Chua and Lorentz Circuits Analyzed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear circuits serve as crucial carriers and physical models for investigating nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior, particularly in the simulation of biological neurons. In this study, Chua's circuit and Lorentz circuit are systematically explored for the first time through machine learning correlation algorithms. Specifically, the upgraded and optimized SINDy-PI model, which is based on neural network and symbolic regression algorithm, is utilized to learn the numerical results of attractors generated by these two nonlinear circuits. Through error analysis, we examine the effects of the precision of input data and the amount of data on the algorithmic model. The findings reveal that when the input data quantity and data precision fall within a certain range, the algorithm model can effectively recognize and restore the differential equation expressions corresponding to the two circuits. Additionally, we test the anti-interference ability of different circuits and the robustness of the algorithm by introducing noise into the test data. The results indicate that under the same noise disturbance, the Lorentz circuit has better noise resistance than Chua's circuit, providing a starting point for further studying the intrinsic properties and characteristics of different nonlinear circuits. The above results will not only offer a reference for the further study of nonlinear circuits and related systems using deep learning algorithms but also lay a preliminary theoretical foundation for the study of related physical problems and applications.</description>

      <title>Joining simplified physics models with coarse grids to speed-up intractable 3D time-domain simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full 3D modelling of time-domain electromagnetic data requires tremendous computational resources. Consequently, simplified physics models prevail in geophysics, using a much faster but approximate (1D) forward model. We propose to join the accuracy of a 1D simplified physics model with the flexibility of coarse grids to reduce the modelling errors, thereby avoiding the full 3D accurate simulations. We exemplify our approach on airborne time-domain electromagnetic data, comparing the modelling error with the standard 3% measurement noise. We find that the modelling error depends on the specific subsurface model (electrical conductivity values, angle representing the deviation of the 1D assumption) and the specific (temporal) discretization. In our example, the computation time is decreased by a factor of 27. Our approach can offer an alternative for surrogate models, statistical relations derived from large 3D datasets, to replace the full 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>Exact scattering cross section for lattice-defect scattering of phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of structurally complex lattice defects, such as functional groups, embedded nanoparticles, and nanopillars, to generate phonon scattering is a popular approach in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications. However, the theoretical treatment of this scattering phenomenon remains a formidable challenge, especially with regards to the determination of the scattering cross sections and rates associated with such lattice defects. Using the extended Atomistic Green's Function (AGF) method, we describe how the numerically exact mode-resolved scattering cross section \sigma can be computed for a phonon scattered by a single lattice defect. We illustrate the generality and utility of the AGF-based treatment with two examples. In the first example, we treat the isotopic scattering of phonons in a harmonic chain of atoms . In the second example, we treat the more complex problem of phonon scattering in a carbon nanotube (CNT) containing an encapsulated C60 molecule which acts as a scatterer of the CNT phonons. The application of this method can enable a more precise characterization of lattice-defect scattering and result in the more controlled use of nanostructuring and lattice defects in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Physics-integrated Neural Network for Quantum Transport Prediction of Field-effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanics-based transport simulation is of importance for the design of ultra-short channel field-effect transistors (FETs) with its capability of understanding the physical mechanism, while facing the primary challenge of the high computational intensity. Traditional machine learning is expected to accelerate the optimization of FET design, yet its application in this field is limited by the lack of both high-fidelity datasets and the integration of physical knowledge. Here, we introduced a physics-integrated neural network framework to predict the transport curves of sub-5-nm gate-all-around (GAA) FETs using an in-house developed high-fidelity database. The transport curves in the database are collected from literature and our first-principles calculations. Beyond silicon, we included indium arsenide, indium phosphide, and selenium nanowires with different structural phases as the FET channel materials. Then, we built a physical-knowledge-integrated hyper vector neural network (PHVNN), in which five new physical features were added into the inputs for prediction transport characteristics, achieving a sufficiently low mean absolute error of 0.39. In particular, ~98% of the current prediction residuals are within one order of magnitude. Using PHVNN, we efficiently screened out the symmetric p-type GAA FETs that possess the same figures of merit with the n-type ones, which are crucial for the fabrication of homogeneous CMOS circuits. Finally, our automatic differentiation analysis provides interpretable insights into the PHVNN, which highlights the important contributions of our new input parameters and improves the reliability of PHVNN. Our approach provides an effective method for rapidly screening appropriate GAA FETs with the prospect of accelerating the design process of next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>H-Matrix Accelerated Direct Matrix Solver using Chebyshev-based Nystr\"om Boundary Integral Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An H-matrix accelerated direct solver employing the high-order Chebyshev-based Boundary Integral Equation (CBIE) method has been formulated, tested, and profiled for performance on high contrast dielectric materials and electrically large perfect electric conductor objects. The matrix fill performance of the CBIE proves to be fast for small to moderately sized problems compared to its counterparts, e.g. the locally corrected Nystr\"om (LCN) method, due to the way it handles the singularities by means of a global change of variable method. However, in the case of electrically large scattering problems, the matrix fill and factorization still dominate the solution time when using a direct solution approach. To address this issue, an H-Matrix framework is employed, effectively resolving the challenge and establishing the CBIE as a competitive high-order method for solving scattering problems with poorly conditioned matrix equations. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Estimating event-by-event multiplicity by a Machine Learning Method for Hadronization Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronization is a non-perturbative process, which theoretical description can not be deduced from first principles. Modeling hadron formation requires several assumptions and various phenomenological approaches. Utilizing state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms, it is eventually possible to train neural networks to learn non-linear and non-perturbative features of the physical processes. In this study, the prediction results of three trained ResNet networks are presented, by investigating charged particle multiplicities at event-by-event level. The widely used Lund string fragmentation model is applied as a training-baseline at $\sqrt{s}= 7$ TeV proton-proton collisions. We found that neural-networks with $ \gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ parameters can predict the event-by-event charged hadron multiplicity values up to $ N_\mathrm{ch}\lesssim 90 $.</description>

      <title>A Generic and Automated Methodology to Simulate Melting Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The melting point of a material constitutes a pivotal property with profound implications across various disciplines of science, engineering, and technology. Recent advancements in machine learning potentials have revolutionized the field, enabling ab initio predictions of materials' melting points through atomic-scale simulations. However, a universal simulation methodology that can be universally applied to any material remains elusive. In this paper, we present a generic, fully automated workflow designed to predict the melting points of materials utilizing molecular dynamics simulations. This workflow incorporates two tailored simulation modalities, each addressing scenarios with and without elemental partitioning between solid and liquid phases. When the compositions of both phases remain unchanged upon melting or solidification, signifying the absence of partitioning, the melting point is identified as the temperature at which these phases coexist in equilibrium. Conversely, in cases where elemental partitioning occurs, our workflow estimates both the nominal melting point, marking the initial transition from solid to liquid, and the nominal solidification point, indicating the reverse process. To ensure precision in determining these critical temperatures, we employ an innovative temperature-volume data fitting technique, suitable for a diverse range of materials exhibiting notable volume disparities between their solid and liquid states. This comprehensive approach offers a robust and versatile solution for predicting melting points, fostering advancements in materials science and technology.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based closure models for large-eddy simulations with explicit filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data from direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows are commonly used to train neural network-based models as subgrid closures for large-eddy simulations; however, models with low a priori accuracy have been observed to fortuitously provide better a posteriori results than models with high a priori accuracy. This anomaly can be traced to a dataset shift in the learning problem, arising from inconsistent filtering in the training and testing stages. We propose a resolution to this issue that uses explicit filtering of the nonlinear advection term in the large-eddy simulation momentum equations to control aliasing errors. Within the context of explicitly-filtered large-eddy simulations, we develop neural network-based models for which a priori accuracy is a good predictor of a posteriori performance. We evaluate the proposed method in a large-eddy simulation of a turbulent flow in a plane channel at $Re_{\tau} = 180$. Our findings show that an explicitly-filtered large-eddy simulation with a filter-to-grid ratio of 2 sufficiently controls the numerical errors so as to allow for accurate and stable simulations.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Physics-informed neural networks for multiscale heat conduction via phonon Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely used for describing multiscale heat conduction (from nm to $\mu$m or mm) in solid materials. Developing numerical approaches to solve this equation is challenging since it is a 7-dimensional integral-differential equation. In this work, we propose Monte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", to solve the phonon BTE to model the multiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural network to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic differentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to address inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods in PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in the temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points randomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points are constructed using the tensor product of the data drawn from the above two steps. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat conduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more memory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs for BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction in a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domain, are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the MC-PINN for heat conduction spanning diffusive and ballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage of the MC-PINN and a state-of-art numerical methods to demonstrate the potential of the MC-PINN for large scale problems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Toward exponentially-convergent simulations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: A time-domain solver for the scalar Teukolsky equation with singular source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from extreme mass ratio inspirals are a key target for space-based gravitational wave detectors. These systems are typically modeled as a distributionally-forced Teukolsky equation, where the smaller black hole is treated as a Dirac delta distribution. Time-domain solvers often use regularization approaches that approximate the Dirac distribution that often introduce small length scales and are a source of systematic error, especially near the smaller black hole. We describe a multi-domain discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the distributionally-forced Teukolsky equation that describes scalar fields evolving on a Kerr spacetime. To handle the Dirac delta, we expand the solution in spherical harmonics and recast the sourced Teukolsky equation as a first-order, one-dimensional symmetric hyperbolic system. This allows us to derive the method's numerical flux to correctly account for the Dirac delta. As a result, our method achieves global spectral accuracy even at the source's location. To connect the near field to future null infinity, we use the hyperboloidal layer method, allowing us to supply outer boundary conditions and providing direct access to the far-field waveform. We document several numerical experiments where we test our method, including convergence tests against exact solutions, energy luminosities for circular orbits, the scheme's superconvergence properties at future null infinity, and the late-time tail behavior of the scalar field. We also compare two systems that arise from different choices of the first-order reduction variables, finding that certain choices are numerically problematic in practice. The methods developed here may be beneficial when computing gravitational self-force effects, where the regularization procedure has been developed for the spherical harmonic modes and high accuracy is needed at the Dirac delta's location.</description>

      <title>Generative Design of Crystal Structures by Point Cloud Representations and Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently generating energetically stable crystal structures has long been a challenge in material design, primarily due to the immense arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice. To facilitate the discovery of stable material, we present a framework for the generation of synthesizable materials, leveraging a point cloud representation to encode intricate structural information. At the heart of this framework lies the introduction of a diffusion model as its foundational pillar. To gauge the efficacy of our approach, we employ it to reconstruct input structures from our training datasets, rigorously validating its high reconstruction performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the profound potential of Point Cloud-Based Crystal Diffusion (PCCD) by generating entirely new materials, emphasizing their synthesizability. Our research stands as a noteworthy contribution to the advancement of materials design and synthesis through the cutting-edge avenue of generative design instead of the conventional substitution or experience-based discovery.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J.Math.Phys.11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>
