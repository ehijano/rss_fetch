      <title>STAA: Spatio-Temporal Alignment Attention for Short-Term Precipitation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a great need to accurately predict short-term precipitation, which has socioeconomic effects such as agriculture and disaster prevention. Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Tropical Cyclone Track and Intensity Forecasts from Artificial Intelligence Weather Prediction (AIWP) Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In just the past few years multiple data-driven Artificial Intelligence Weather Prediction (AIWP) models have been developed, with new versions appearing almost monthly. Given this rapid development, the applicability of these models to operational forecasting has yet to be adequately explored and documented. To assess their utility for operational tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting, the NHC verification procedure is used to evaluate seven-day track and intensity predictions for northern hemisphere TCs from May-November 2023. Four open-source AIWP models are considered (FourCastNetv1, FourCastNetv2-small, GraphCast-operational and Pangu-Weather).
  The AIWP track forecast errors and detection rates are comparable to those from the best-performing operational forecast models. However, the AIWP intensity forecast errors are larger than those of even the simplest intensity forecasts based on climatology and persistence. The AIWP models almost always reduce the TC intensity, especially within the first 24 h of the forecast, resulting in a substantial low bias.
  The contribution of the AIWP models to the NHC model consensus was also evaluated. The consensus track errors are reduced by up to 11% at the longer time periods. The five-day NHC official track forecasts have improved by about 2% per year since 2001, so this represents more than a five-year gain in accuracy. Despite substantial negative intensity biases, the AIWP models have a neutral impact on the intensity consensus. These results show that the current formulation of the AIWP models have promise for operational TC track forecasts, but improved bias corrections or model reformulations will be needed for accurate intensity forecasts.</description>

      <title>FuXi-2.0: Advancing machine learning weather forecasting model for practical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have become increasingly valuable in weather forecasting, providing forecasts that not only lower computational costs but often match or exceed the accuracy of traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Despite their potential, ML models typically suffer from limitations such as coarse temporal resolution, typically 6 hours, and a limited set of meteorological variables, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce FuXi-2.0, an advanced ML model that delivers 1-hourly global weather forecasts and includes a comprehensive set of essential meteorological variables, thereby expanding its utility across various sectors like wind and solar energy, aviation, and marine shipping. Our study conducts comparative analyses between ML-based 1-hourly forecasts and those from the high-resolution forecast (HRES) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for various practical scenarios. The results demonstrate that FuXi-2.0 consistently outperforms ECMWF HRES in forecasting key meteorological variables relevant to these sectors. In particular, FuXi-2.0 shows superior performance in wind power forecasting compared to ECMWF HRES, further validating its efficacy as a reliable tool for scenarios demanding precise weather forecasts. Additionally, FuXi-2.0 also integrates both atmospheric and oceanic components, representing a significant step forward in the development of coupled atmospheric-ocean models. Further comparative analyses reveal that FuXi-2.0 provides more accurate forecasts of tropical cyclone intensity than its predecessor, FuXi-1.0, suggesting that there are benefits of an atmosphere-ocean coupled model over atmosphere-only models.</description>

      <title>A Liang-Kleeman Causality Analysis based on Linear Inverse Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality analysis is a powerful tool for determining cause-and-effect relationships between variables in a system by quantifying the influence of one variable on another. Despite significant advancements in the field, many existing studies are constrained by their focus on unidirectional causality or Gaussian external forcing, limiting their applicability to complex real-world problems. This study proposes a novel data-driven approach to causality analysis for complex stochastic differential systems, integrating the concepts of Liang-Kleeman information flow and linear inverse modeling. Our method models environmental noise as either memoryless Gaussian white noise or memory-retaining Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise, and allows for self and mutual causality, providing a more realistic representation and interpretation of the underlying system. Moreover, this LIM-based approach can identify the individual contribution of dynamics and correlation to causality. We apply this approach to re-examine the causal relationships between the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), two major climate phenomena that significantly influence global climate patterns. In general, regardless of the type of noise used, the causality between ENSO and IOD is mutual but asymmetric, with the causality map reflecting an ENSO-like pattern consistent with previous studies. Notably, in the case of colored noise, the noise memory map reveals a hotspot in the Ni\~no 3 region, which is further related to the information flow. This suggests that our approach offers a more comprehensive framework and provides deeper insights into the causal inference of global climate systems.</description>

      <title>Earth's Mesosphere During Possible Encounters With Massive Interstellar Clouds 2 and 7 Million Years Ago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our solar system's path has recently been shown to potentially intersect dense interstellar clouds 2 and 7 million years ago: the Local Lynx of Cold Cloud and the edge of the Local Bubble. These clouds compressed the heliosphere, directly exposing Earth to the interstellar medium. Previous studies that examined climate effects of these encounters argued for an induced ice age due to the formation of global noctilucent clouds (NLCs). Here, we revisit such studies with a modern 2D atmospheric chemistry model using parameters of global heliospheric magnetohydrodynamic models as input. We show that NLCs remain confined to polar latitudes and short seasonal lifetimes during these dense cloud crossings lasting $\sim10^5$ years. Polar mesospheric ozone becomes significantly depleted, but the total ozone column broadly increases. Furthermore, we show that the densest NLCs lessen the amount of sunlight reaching the surface instantaneously by up to 7% while halving outgoing longwave radiation.</description>

      <title>Stratospheric aerosol source inversion: Noise, variability, and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratospheric aerosols play an important role in the earth system and can affect the climate on timescales of months to years. However, estimating the characteristics of partially observed aerosol injections, such as those from volcanic eruptions, is fraught with uncertainties. This article presents a framework for stratospheric aerosol source inversion which accounts for background aerosol noise and earth system internal variability via a Bayesian approximation error approach. We leverage specially designed earth system model simulations using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). A comprehensive framework for data generation, data processing, dimension reduction, operator learning, and Bayesian inversion is presented where each component of the framework is designed to address particular challenges in stratospheric modeling on the global scale. We present numerical results using synthesized observational data to rigorously assess the ability of our approach to estimate aerosol sources and associate uncertainty with those estimates.</description>

      <title>Combined Optimization of Dynamics and Assimilation with End-to-End Learning on Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitting nonlinear dynamical models to sparse and noisy observations is fundamentally challenging. Identifying dynamics requires data assimilation (DA) to estimate system states, but DA requires an accurate dynamical model. To break this deadlock we present CODA, an end-to-end optimization scheme for jointly learning dynamics and DA directly from sparse and noisy observations. A neural network is trained to carry out data accurate, efficient and parallel-in-time DA, while free parameters of the dynamical system are simultaneously optimized. We carry out end-to-end learning directly on observation data, introducing a novel learning objective that combines unrolled auto-regressive dynamics with the data- and self-consistency terms of weak-constraint 4Dvar DA. By taking into account interactions between new and existing simulation components over multiple time steps, CODA can recover initial conditions, fit unknown dynamical parameters and learn neural network-based PDE terms to match both available observations and self-consistency constraints. In addition to facilitating end-to-end learning of dynamics and providing fast, amortized, non-sequential DA, CODA provides greater robustness to model misspecification than classical DA approaches.</description>

      <title>Segmenting sea ice floes in close-range optical imagery with active contour and foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size and shape of sea ice floes play a crucial role in influencing ocean-atmosphere energy exchanges, sea ice concentrations, albedo, and wave propagation through ice-covered waters. Despite the availability of diverse image segmentation techniques for analyzing sea ice imagery, accurately detecting and measuring floes remains a considerable challenge. This study presents a precise methodology for in-situ sea ice imagery acquisition, including automated orthorectification to correct perspective distortions. The image dataset, collected during an Antarctic winter expedition, was used to evaluate various automated image segmentation approaches: the traditional GVF Snake algorithm and the advanced deep learning model, Segment Anything Model (SAM). To address the limitations of each method, a hybrid algorithm combining traditional and AI-based techniques is proposed. The effectiveness of these approaches was validated through a detailed analysis of ice floe detection accuracy, floe size, and ice concentration statistics, with the outcomes normalized against a manually segmented benchmark.</description>
