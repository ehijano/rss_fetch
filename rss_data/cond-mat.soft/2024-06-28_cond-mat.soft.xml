      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of water-ethanol mixtures. I. Composition trends in thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored the composition dependence of a rather comprehensive set of properties of liquid water-ethanol mixtures by using the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations. The united atom non-polarizable model from the TraPPE data basis for the ethanol molecule combined with the TIP4P-2005 and SPC/E water models is considered. We restrict our calculations to atmospheric pressure, 0.1013 MPa, and room temperature, 298.15 K. Composition trends of the behavior of density, excess mixing volume, apparent molar volumes are described. On the other hand, the excess mixing enthalpy and partial molar enthalpies of species are reported. Besides, we explore the coefficient of isobaric thermal expansion, isothermal heat capacity, adiabatic bulk modulus and heat capacity at constant pressure. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficients of species, the static dielectric constant and the surface tension are described. We intend to get insights into peculiarities of mixing of species in the mixture upon changes of ethanol molar fraction. The quality of predictions of the models is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Then, necessary improvements of the modelling are discussed.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of forces in air-based acoustic levitation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation is frequently used for non-contact manipulation of objects and to study the impact of microgravity on physical and biological processes. While the force field produced by sound pressure lifts particles against gravity (primary acoustic force), multiple levitating objects in the same acoustic cavity interact via forces that arise from scattered sound (secondary acoustic forces). Current experimental techniques for obtaining these force fields are not well-suited for mapping the primary force field at high spatial resolution and cannot directly measure the secondary scattering force. Here we introduce a method that can measure both acoustic forces in situ, including secondary forces in the near-field limit between arbitrarily shaped, closely spaced objects. Operating similarly to an atomic force microscope, the method inserts into the acoustic cavity a suitably shaped probe tip at the end of a long, flexible cantilever and optically detects its deflection. This makes it possible to measure forces with a resolution better than 50 nN, and also to apply stress or strain in a controlled manner to manipulate levitated objects. We demonstrate this by extracting the acoustic potential present in a levitation cavity, directly measuring the acoustic scattering force between two objects, and applying tension to a levitated granular raft of acoustically-bound particles in order to obtain the force-displacement curve for its deformation.</description>

      <title>Vapour-liquid phase behaviour of primitive models of ionic liquids confined in disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the description of ionic liquids (ILs) confined in a porous medium formed by a matrix of immobile randomly placed uncharged particles. The IL is modelled as an electroneutral mixture of hardsphere anions and flexible linear chain cations, represented by tangentially bonded hard spheres with the charge located on one of the terminal beads. The theory combines a generalization of the scaled particle theory, Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the associative mean-spherical approximation and allows one to obtain analytical expressions for the pressure and chemical potentials of the matrix-IL system. Using the theory, we calculate the vapour-liquid phase diagrams for two versions of the IL model, i.e., when the cation is modelled as a dimer and as a chain, in a complete association limit. The effects of the matrix confinement and of the non-spherical shape of the cations on the vapour-liquid phase diagrams are studied.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly behaviour of diblock copolymer-diblock copolymer under oscillating shear field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-assembly behaviour of a diblock copolymer-diblock copolymer mixture under an oscillating shear field is investigated via cell dynamics simulation. The results indicate that the macrophase separation of the composite system is accompanied by the corresponding microphase separation induced by the oscillating shear field. With an increase in the shear frequency, the AB phase changes from a tilted layered structure to a parallel layered structure, and finally to a vertical layered structure. The CD phase transforms from the initial concentric ring into a parallel layer in the ring and then into a parallel layered structure; thus, the system finally forms a layered structure of the AB phase (vertical layer) and CD phase (parallel layer) perpendicular to each other. To verify the phase transition, the dynamic evolution of the domain size at different shear frequencies is analysed. The ordered phase transition with an increase in the oscillating shear field varies when the initial composition ratio of the system is changed. This conclusion provides a valuable guidance for the formation and transformation of ordered structures in experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergence of metachronal waves in a chain of symmetrically beating filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that metachronal waves (MCWs) can emerge from a chain of symmetrically beating nematodes aligned at the edge of sessile droplets. Our study, employing a coupled elastohydrodynamic model of active filaments, elucidates that a misalignment caused by a tilt against the bounding wall disrupts the synchronization and generates a constant time lag between adjacent filaments, leading to MCWs. The MCWs, enhancing the fluid circulation, achieve their maximum thermodynamic efficiency over the same range of tilt angles observed in the nematode experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Efficiency and Effective Temperature of Bacterial Heat Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Brownian dynamics simulation of the bacterial Stirling engine studied by Krishnamurthy et al., Nat. Phys. 12, 1134 (2016). In their experimental setup, an overdamped colloid in an optical trap with time-modulated stiffness interacts with a bacterial bath that we represent by an ensemble of overdamped active particles. In the parameter regime of the experiment the thermodynamic performance is governed by an effective temperature and can be parametrized analytically by active Brownian particle models. We quantitatively reproduce the efficiencies reported for the experiments under the assumption that energy exchange with the bath during isochores of the cycle is entirely recuperated and in agreement with the second law.</description>

      <title>Double Mpemba effect in the cooling of trapped colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect describes the phenomenon that a system at a hot initial temperature cools faster than at an initial warm temperature in the same environment. Such an anomalous cooling has recently been predicted and realized for trapped colloids. Here, we investigate the freezing behavior of a passive colloidal particle by employing numerical Brownian dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations with a model that can be directly tested in experiments. During the cooling process, the colloidal particle exhibits multiple non-monotonic regimes in cooling rates, with the cooling time decreasing twice as a function of the initial temperature-an unexpected phenomenon we refer to as the Double Mpemba effect. Additionally, we demonstrate that both the Mpemba and Double Mpemba effects can be predicted by various machine learning methods, which expedite the analysis of complex, computationally intensive systems.</description>

      <title>Coagulation-flocculation process on a lattice: Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coagulation-flocculation, the physicochemical process widely used for purification a wastewater, is affected both by chemical details of involved polymers and by the statistics of their conformations on a large scale. The latter aspect is covered in this study by employing a coarse-grained modelling approach based on a combination of two paradigms of statistical mechanics. One is the self-avoiding walk (SAW) which generates a range of conformations for a linear polymer of $N_{{\rm SAW}}$ monomers. Another one is a non-trivial diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) process of $N_{{\rm DLA}}$ impurities (referred thereafter as "particles") which describes their coagulation occurring with the probability $0&lt; p \leq 1$ ($p=1$ recovers a standard DLA). DLA of diffusive particles is complemented by their irreversible adsorption on the SAW monomers occurring with the probability equal to one, both processes resulting in formation of the DLA-SAW agglomerates. The dynamics of formation of such agglomerates, as well as their fractal dimensions and internal structure are of practical interest. We consider a range of related characteristics, such as: (i) absolute $N_a$ and relative $n_a$ adsorbing efficiencies of SAW; (ii) effective gyration radius $R_{g {\rm DLA-SAW}}$ of the DLA-SAW agglomerates; and (iii) the fractal dimension $D_{{\rm DLA-SAW}}$ of these aggregates. These are studied within a wide range for each parameter from a set $\{p,N_{{\rm DLA}},N_{{\rm SAW}}\}$.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Dynamics of a Functionally Graded Dielectric Elastomer Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear vibrations of a functionally graded dielectric elastomer plate subjected to electromechanical loads. We focus on local and global dynamics in the system. We employ the Gent strain energy function to model the dielectric elastomer. The functionally graded parameters are the shear modulus, mass density, and permittivity of the elastomer, which are formulated by a common through-thickness power-law scheme. We derive the equation of motion using the Euler-Lagrange equations and solve it numerically with the Runge-Kutta method and a continuation-based method. We investigate the influence of the functionally graded parameters on equilibrium points, natural frequencies, and static/dynamic instability. We also establish a Hamiltonian energy method to detect safe regions of operating gradient parameters. Furthermore, we explore the effect of the functionally graded parameters on chaos and resonance by plotting several numerical diagrams, including time histories, phase portraits, Poincar\'e maps, largest Lyapunov exponent criteria, bifurcation diagram of Poincar\'e maps, and frequency-stretch curves. The results provide a benchmark for developing functionally graded soft smart materials.</description>

      <title>Early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening of dense suspensions of millimeter-sized particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the phenomenon of the early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, where materials undergo solidification upon impact. While Stokes flow theory traditionally applies to suspensions with micrometer-sized particles due to their low Reynolds numbers, suspensions containing larger particles defy such idealizations. Our work focuses on the early-stage impact-induced hardening of suspensions containing millimeter-sized particles through dynamic impact experiments. We are particularly interested in the maximum drag force $F_\mathrm{max}$ acting on the projectile as a function of the impact speed $u_0$. We successfully conducted experiments using these suspensions and confirmed the relation $F_\mathrm{max}\sim u_0^{3/2}$ for relatively large $u_0$ as observed in the previous studies suspensions of micrometer-sized particles. Our findings reveal that the early-stage behaviors of millimeter-sized particle suspensions align well with predictions from the floating model, typically applicable under Stokes flow conditions. This research sheds light on the complex dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, particularly with larger particles, advancing our understanding beyond conventional micrometer-sized systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal self-assembly pathways towards colloidal lattices with tunable flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexibility governs the many properties of materials and is crucial for the function of proteins and biopolymers. However, how the self-assembly of flexibly bonded particles can lead to larger structures with global reconfigurability is unexplored. We here use a binary colloidal model system equipped with flexible DNA-based bonds to study how regular structures with tunable flexibility can be created through self-assembly. We find that the reconfigurability during lattice growth leads to lattices with square symmetry which are inherently mechanically unstable and hence thermally floppy. By considering the role of size ratio, number ratio, and directionality induced by particle shape, we identify the optimal pathways that maximize the yield and flexibility of these square lattices using a combination of experiments, analytical calculations, and simulations. Our study highlights the crucial role of reconfigurability in systems that are governed by enthalpic and entropic principles, from synthetic to biological, and might be useful for creating materials with novel or reconfigurable properties.</description>

      <title>Onset of spontaneous beating and whirling in the follower force model of an active filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the onset of spontaneous dynamics in the follower force model of an active filament, wherein a slender elastic filament in a viscous liquid is clamped normal to a wall at one end and subjected to a tangential compressive force at the other. Clarke, Hwang and Keaveny (Phys. Rev. Fluids, to appear) have recently conducted a thorough investigation of this model using methods of computational dynamical systems; inter alia, they show that the filament first losses stability via a supercritical double-Hopf bifurcation, with periodic 'planar-beating' states (unstable) and 'whirling' states (stable) simultaneously emerging at the critical follower-force value. We complement their numerical study by carrying out a weakly nonlinear analysis close to this unconventional bifurcation, using the method of multiple scales. The main outcome is an 'amplitude equation' governing the slow modulation of small-magnitude oscillations of the filament in that regime. Analysis of this reduced-order model provides insights into the onset of spontaneous dynamics, including the creation of the nonlinear whirling states from particular superpositions of linear planar-beating modes as well as the selection of whirling over planar beating in three-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>Slow polymer dynamics in poly(3-hexylthiophene) probed by muon spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular dynamics of regioregulated poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT is investigated using muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR). The response of the $\mu$SR spectra to a longitudinal magnetic field ($B_{\rm LF}$, parallel to the initial muon spin direction) indicates that the implanted muons form both muonated radicals localized on the thiophene ring and diamagnetic states with comparable yields. Moreover, the unpaired electron in the radical undergoes hyperfine interactions with muon bound to thiophene and with neighboring protons, whose fluctuations can serve as a measure for the molecular dynamics. The $B_{\rm LF}$ dependence of the longitudinal muon spin relaxation rate ($1/T_{1\mu}$) measured in detail at several temperatures is found to be well reproduced by the spectral density function $J(\omega)$ derived from the local susceptibility that incorporates the Havriliak-Negami (H-N) function used in the analysis of dielectric relaxation, $\chi(\omega)\propto1/[1-i(\omega/\tilde{\nu})^\delta]^\gamma$ (where $\tilde{\nu}$ is the mean fluctuation rate, and $0&lt;\gamma, \delta\le1$). The magnitude of $\tilde{\nu}$ and its temperature dependence deduced from the analysis of $1/T_{1\mu}$ are found to be consistent with the motion of hexyl chains and thiophene rings suggested by $^{13}$C-NMR. The present result marks a methodological milestone in the application of $\mu$SR to the dynamics of complex systems with coexisting fluctuations over a wide range of time scales, such as polymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a recently proposed shifting operation on classical phase space as a gauge transformation for statistical mechanical microstates. The infinitesimal generators of the continuous gauge group form a non-commutative Lie algebra, which induces exact sum rules when thermally averaged. Gauge invariance with respect to finite shifting is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation in the transformed phase space which generates identical equilibrium averages. Our results point towards a deeper basis of statistical mechanics than previously known and they offer avenues for systematic construction of exact identities and of sampling algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the hypothesized functions of biomolecular condensates is to act as chemical reactors, where chemical reactions can be modulated, i.e. accelerated or slowed down, while substrate molecules enter and products exit from the condensate. Likewise, the components themselves that take part in the architectural integrity of condensates might be modified by active (energy consuming, non-equilibrium) processes, e.g. by ATPase chaperones or by kinases and phosphatases. In this work, we study how the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, such as in the case of liquid-liquid phase separation, affects active chemical reactions and results in the presence of directional flows of matter, which are one of the hallmarks of non-equilibirum processes. We establish the minimal conditions for the existence of such spatial currents, and we furthermore find that these fluxes are maximal at the condensate interface. These results propose that some condensates might be most efficient as chemical factories due to their interfaces rather than their volumes, and could suggest a possible biological reason for the the observed abundance of small non-fusing condensates inside the cell, thus maximizing their surface and the associated fluxes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of underdamped Brownian collisional engines: New insights and resonant phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>

      <title>Computation of viscoelastic shear shock waves using finite volume schemes with artificial compressibility</title>

Abstract: The formation of shear shock waves in the brain has been proposed as one of the plausible explanations for deep intracranial injuries. In fact, such singular solutions emerge naturally in soft viscoelastic tissues under dynamic loading conditions. To improve our understanding of the mechanical processes at hand, the development of dedicated computational models is needed. The present study concerns three-dimensional numerical models of incompressible viscoelastic solids whose motion is analysed by means of shock-capturing finite volume methods. More specifically, we focus on the use of the artificial compressibility method, a technique that has been frequently employed in computational fluid dynamics. The material behaviour is deduced from the Fung--Simo quasi-linear viscoelasiticity theory (QLV) where the elastic response is of Yeoh type. We analyse the accuracy of the method and demonstrate its applicability for the study of nonlinear wave propagation in soft solids. The numerical results cover accuracy tests, shock formation and wave focusing.</description>

      <title>Rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres across the jamming and viscous-to-inertial transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres is studied across jamming but also across the viscous and inertial regimes using a custom pressure- and volume-imposed rheometer. The study shows that the granular rheology found for suspensions of hard spheres can be extended to a soft granular rheology (SGranR) by renormalizing the critical volume fraction and friction coefficient to pressure-dependent values and using the addition of the viscous and inertial stress scales. This SGranR encompasses rheological behaviors on both sides of the jamming transition, resulting in an approximate collapse of the rheological data into two branches when scaled with the distance to jamming, as observed for soft colloids. This research suggests that suspensions of soft particles across flow regimes can be described by a unified SGranR framework around the jamming transition.</description>

      <title>Hyper-density functional theory of soft matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme for investigating arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. Extending the grand canonical ensemble yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike equation. While the local compressibility and simple observables permit analytic treatment, complex order parameters are accessible via simulation-based supervised machine learning of neural hyper-direct correlation functionals. We exemplify efficient and accurate neural predictions for the cluster statistics of hard rods, square well rods, and hard spheres. The theory allows to treat complex observables, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Flipping Out: Role of Arginine in Hydrophobic Interactions and Biological Formulation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arginine has been a mainstay in biological formulation development for decades. To date, the way arginine modulates protein stability has been widely studied and debated. Here, we employed a hydrophobic polymer to decouple hydrophobic effects from other interactions relevant to protein folding. While existing hypotheses for the effects of arginine can generally be categorized as either direct or indirect, our results indicate that direct and indirect mechanisms of arginine co-exist and oppose each other. At low concentrations, arginine was observed to stabilize hydrophobic polymer collapse via a sidechain-dominated direct mechanism, while at high concentrations, arginine stabilized polymer collapse via a backbone-dominated indirect mechanism. When adding partial charges to sites on the polymer, arginine destabilized polymer collapse. Further, we found arginine-induced destabilization of a model virus similar to direct-mechanism destabilization of the charged polymer, and concentration-dependent stabilization of a model protein similar to the indirect mechanism of hydrophobic polymer stabilization. These findings highlight the modular nature of the widely used additive arginine, with relevance in the design of stable biological formulations.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of "Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>
