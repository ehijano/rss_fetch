      <title>Robust Pricing and Hedging of American Options in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the robust pricing and hedging of American options in a continuous time setting. We assume asset prices are continuous semimartingales, but we allow for general model uncertainty specification via adapted closed convex constraints on the volatility. We prove the robust pricing-hedging duality. When European options with given prices are available for static trading, we show that duality holds against richer models where these options are traded dynamically. Our proofs rely on probabilistic treatment of randomised stopping times and suitable measure decoupling, and on optimal transport duality. In addition, similarly to the approach of Aksamit et al. (2019) in discrete time, we identify American options with European options on an enlarged space.</description>

      <title>A Microstructure Analysis of Coupling in CFMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The programmable and composable nature of smart contract protocols has enabled the emergence of novel market structures and asset classes that are architecturally frictional to implement in traditional financial paradigms. This fluidity has produced an understudied class of market dynamics, particularly in coupled markets where one market serves as an oracle for the other. In such market structures, purchases or liquidations through the intermediate asset create coupled price action between the intermediate and final assets; leading to basket inflation or deflation when denominated in the riskless asset. This paper examines the microstructure of this inflationary dynamic given two constant function market makers (CFMMs) as the intermediate market structures; attempting to quantify their contributions to the former relative to familiar pool metrics such as price drift, trade size, and market depth. Further, a concrete case study is developed, where both markets are constant product markets. The intention is to shed light on the market design process within such coupled environments.</description>
