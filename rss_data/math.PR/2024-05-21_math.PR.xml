      <title>Trace Moments for Schr\"odinger Operators with Matrix White Noise and the Rigidity of the Multivariate Stochastic Airy Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semigroups of random Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\widehat{H}f=-\frac12f''+(V+\xi)f$, where $f:I\to\mathbb F^r$ ($\mathbb F=\mathbb R,\mathbb C,\mathbb H$) are vector-valued functions on a possibly infinite interval $I\subset\mathbb R$ that satisfy a mix of Robin and Dirichlet boundary conditions, $V$ is a deterministic diagonal potential with power-law growth at infinity, and $\xi$ is a matrix white noise. Our main result consists of Feynman-Kac formulas for trace moments of the form $\mathbf E[\prod_{k=1}^n\mathrm{Tr}[\mathrm e^{-t_k\widehat{H}}]]$ ($n\in\mathbb N$, $t_k&gt;0$).
  One notable example covered by our main result consists of the multivariate stochastic Airy operator (SAO) of Bloemendal and Vir\'ag (Ann. Probab., 44(4):2726-2769, 2016), which characterizes the soft-edge eigenvalue fluctuations of critical rank-$r$ spiked Wishart and GO/U/SE random matrices. As a corollary of our main result, we prove that if $V$'s growth is at least linear (this includes the multivariate SAO), then $\widehat{H}$'s spectrum is number rigid in the sense of Ghosh and Peres (Duke Math. J., 166(10):1789-1858, 2017). Together with the rigidity of the scalar SAO, this completes the characterization of number rigidity in the soft-edge limits of Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles and their finite-rank spiked versions.</description>

      <title>Feller generators with singular drifts in the critical range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider diffusion operator $-\Delta + b \cdot \nabla$ in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 3$, with drift $b$ in a large class of locally unbounded vector fields that can have critical-order singularities. Covering the entire range of admissible magnitudes of singularities of $b$ (but excluding the borderline value), we construct a strongly continuous Feller semigroup on the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, thus completing a number of results on well-posedness of SDEs with singular drifts. The previous results on Feller semigroups employed strong elliptic gradient bounds and hence required the magnitude of the singularities to be less than a small dimension-dependent constant. Our approach is different and uses De Giorgi's method ran in $L^p$ for $p$ sufficiently large, hence the gain in the assumptions on singular drift.
  For the critical borderline value of the magnitude of singularities of $b$, we construct a strongly continuous semigroup in a ``critical'' Orlicz space on $\mathbb R^d$ whose local topology is stronger than the local topology of $L^p$ for any $2 \leq p&lt;\infty$ but is slightly weaker than that of $L^\infty$.</description>

      <title>Learning models on rooted regular trees with majority update policy: convergence and phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a learning model in which an agent is stationed at each vertex of $\mathbb{T}_{m}$, the rooted tree in which each vertex has $m$ children. At any time-step $t \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$, they are allowed to select one of two available technologies: $B$ and $R$. Let the technology chosen by the agent at vertex $v\in\mathbb{T}_{m}$, at time-step $t$, be $C_{t}(v)$. Let $\{C_{0}(v):v\in\mathbb{T}_{m}\}$ be i.i.d., where $C_{0}(v)=B$ with probability $\pi_{0}$. During epoch $t$, the agent at $v$ performs an experiment that results in success with probability $p_{B}$ if $C_{t}(v)=B$, and with probability $p_{R}$ if $C_{t}(v)=R$. If the children of $v$ are $v_{1},\ldots,v_{m}$, the agent at $v$ updates their technology to $C_{t+1}(v)=B$ if the number of successes among all $v_{i}$ with $C_{t}(v_{i})=B$ exceeds, strictly, the number of successes among all $v_{j}$ with $C_{t}(v_{j})=R$. If these numbers are equal, then the agent at $v$ sets $C_{t+1}(v)=B$ with probability $1/2$. Else, $C_{t+1}(v)=R$. We show that $\{C_{t}(v):v\in\mathbb{T}_{m}\}$ is i.i.d., where $C_{t}(v)=B$ with probability $\pi_{t}$, and $\{\pi_{t}\}_{t \in \mathbb{N}_{0}}$ converges to a fixed point $\pi$ of a function $g_{m}$. For $m \geqslant 3$, there exists a $p(m) \in (0,1)$ such that $g_{m}$ has a unique fixed point, $1/2$, when $p \leqslant p(m)$, and three distinct fixed points, of the form $\alpha$, $1/2$ and $1-\alpha$, when $p &gt; p(m)$. When $m=3$, $p_{B}=1$ and $p_{R} \in [0,1)$, we show that $g_{3}$ has a unique fixed point, $1$, when $p_{R} &lt; \sqrt{3}-1$, two distinct fixed points, one of which is $1$, when $p_{R} = \sqrt{3}-1$, and three distinct fixed points, one of which is $1$, when $p_{R} &gt; \sqrt{3}-1$. When $g_{m}$ has multiple fixed points, we also specify which of these fixed points $\pi$ equals, depending on $\pi_{0}$. For $m=2$, we describe the behaviour of $g_{3}$ for all $p_{B}$ and $p_{R}$.</description>

      <title>Why does the elephant random walk behave as the randomized play-the-winner rule?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The randomized play-the-winner rule (RPW) is a response-adaptive design proposed by Wei and Durham (1978) for sequentially randomizing patients to treatments in a two-treatment clinical trial so that more patients are assigned to the better treatment as the clinical trial goes on. The elephant random walk (ERW) proposed by Schutz and Trimper (2004) is a non-Markovian discrete-time random walk on $\mathbb Z$ which has a link to a famous saying that elephants can always remember where they have been. The asymptotic behaviors of RPW rule and ERW have been studied in litterateurs independently, and their asymptotic behaviors are very similar. In this paper, we show that the RPW rule is a biased ERW and link them with the recursive stochastic algorithm. With the help of a recursive stochastic algorithm, we obtain the strong invariance principle of the ERW as well as multi-dimensional ERW with random step sizes. By the strong invariance principle, the central limit theorem and precise law of the iterated logarithm are obtained for both the multi-dimensional ERW, the multi-dimensional ERW with random step sizes and their centers of mass.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity of random measures on Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate lower asymptotic bounds of number variances for invariant locally square-integrable random measures on Euclidean and real hyperbolic spaces. In the Euclidean case we show that there are subsequences of radii for which the number variance grows at least as fast as the volume of the boundary of Euclidean balls, generalizing a classical result of Beck. With regards to real hyperbolic spaces we prove that random measures are never geometrically hyperuniform and if the random measure admits non-trivial complementary series diffraction, then it is hyperfluctuating. Moreover, we define spectral hyperuniformity and stealth of random measures on real hyperbolic spaces in terms of vanishing of the complementary series diffraction and sub-Poissonian decay of the principal series diffraction around the Harish-Chandra $\Xi$-function.</description>

      <title>A description based on optimal transport for a class of stochastic McKean-Vlasov control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of an $N$-particle Markovian controlled system to the solution of a family of stochastic McKean-Vlasov control problems, either with a finite horizon or Schr\"odinger type cost functional. Specifically, under suitable assumptions, we prove the convergence of the value functions, the fixed-time probability distributions, and the relative entropy of their path-space probability laws. These proofs are based on a Benamou-Brenier type reformulation of the problem and a superposition principle, both of which are tools from the theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Dimensional System Signature: System Signature Under the Repairable Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigation of the reliability of technical systems is one of the application areas of stochastic processes. The reliability of a technical system is based on two main elements. The first is the connection type of the system, and the second is the distribution of the working times of the components consisting of the system. In this study, system signatures and their reliability will be calculated under the repairable principle of parallel and serial systems consisting of two components. Although there are a limited number of studies in the literature for repairable systems, there is no study on creating the signature of repairable systems. In technical systems where there is no repair principle, although the system signature has limited components, the technical systems working under the repairable principle, have infinite components of the system signature. While creating the system signature, the probability that the working time of the component that is in the state of the system failure is greater than the repair time was defined as the parameter {\xi}. In the application part of the study, under the principle of repair, the system signature, and the reliability of the system were be successfully calculated.</description>

      <title>On an upper bound of the set of copulas with a given curvilinear section</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterizations when two natural upper bounds of the set of copulas with a given diagonal section are copulas have been well studied in the literature. Given a curvilinear section, however, there is only a partial result concerning the characterization when a natural upper bound of the set of copulas is a copula. In this paper, we completely solve the characterization problem for this natural upper bound to be a copula in the curvilinear case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents algorithms for generating small random samples without replacement. It considers two cases. It presents an algorithm for sampling a pair of distinct integers, and an algorithm for sampling a triple of distinct integers. The worst case runtime of both algorithms is constant, while the worst case runtime of common algorithms for the general case of sampling $k$ elements from a set of $n$ are linear in $n$. Java implementations of both algorithms are included in the open source library $\rho\mu$.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we delve into the exploration of the first and second Zagreb connection indices of both polyomino chains and random polyomino chains. Our methodology relies on the utilization of Markov chain theory. Within this framework, the article thoroughly examines precise formulas and investigates extreme values. Leveraging the derived formulas, we further explore and elucidate the long-term behavior exhibited by random polyomino chains.</description>

      <title>Stochastic porous media equation with Robin boundary conditions, gravity-driven infiltration and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim at studying a novel mathematical model associated to a physical phenomenon of infiltration in an homogeneous porous medium. The particularities of our system are connected to the presence of a gravitational acceleration term proportional to the level of saturation, and of a Brownian multiplicative perturbation. Furthermore, the boundary conditions intervene in a Robin manner with the distinction of the behavior along the inflow and outflow respectively. We provide qualitative results of well-posedness, the investigation being conducted through a functional approach.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and departure statistics of critically loaded queues: oscillating cumulants and generalized BRAVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Queueing theory is used for modeling biological processes, traffic flows and many more real-life situations. Beyond that, queues describe systems out of equilibrium and can thus be considered as minimal models of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We demonstrate that non-equilibrium phase transitions of queues in the steady state are accompanied by a nontrivial flow of departing customers. Our analytical results show that the cumulants of the departure statistics deviate strongly from Poissonian values and oscillate in the vicinity of phase transitions, i.e., if a critical load is approached. The load-dependent oscillations of the cumulants generalize the BRAVO effect (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs) in queues and may occur in other boundary-driven non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Commutative codensity monads and probability bimeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several well-studied probability monads have been expressed as codensity monads over small categories of stochastic maps, giving a limit description of spaces of probability measures. In this paper we show how properties of probability monads such as commutativity and affineness can arise from their codensity presentation. First we show that their codensity presentation is closely related to another characterisation of probability monads as terminal endofunctors admitting certain maps into the Giry monad, which allows us to generalise a result by Van Breugel on the Kantorovich monad. We then provide sufficient conditions for a codensity monad to lift to $\bf{MonCat}$, and give a characterisation of exactly pointwise monoidal codensity monads; codensity monads that satisfy a strengthening of these conditions. We show that the Radon monad is exactly pointwise monoidal, and hence give a description of the tensor product of free algebras of the Radon monad in terms of Day convolution. Finally we show that the Giry monad is not exactly pointwise monoidal due to the existence of probability bimeasures that do not extend to measures, although its restriction to standard Borel spaces is. We introduce the notion of a $*$-monad and its Kleisli monoidal op-multicategory to describe the categorical structure that organises the spaces of probability polymeasures on measurable spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning the Infinitesimal Generator of Stochastic Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address data-driven learning of the infinitesimal generator of stochastic diffusion processes, essential for understanding numerical simulations of natural and physical systems. The unbounded nature of the generator poses significant challenges, rendering conventional analysis techniques for Hilbert-Schmidt operators ineffective. To overcome this, we introduce a novel framework based on the energy functional for these stochastic processes. Our approach integrates physical priors through an energy-based risk metric in both full and partial knowledge settings. We evaluate the statistical performance of a reduced-rank estimator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) in the partial knowledge setting. Notably, our approach provides learning bounds independent of the state space dimension and ensures non-spurious spectral estimation. Additionally, we elucidate how the distortion between the intrinsic energy-induced metric of the stochastic diffusion and the RKHS metric used for generator estimation impacts the spectral learning bounds.</description>

Abstract: We prove several forms of renewal theorem tailored to renewal processes with marks and clusters. In particular, for an i.i.d. sequence $(\xi_i,X_i)_{i \geq 0}$, where $\xi_0$ denotes a finite point process on $\mathbb{R}$ and $X_0$ denotes a nonnegative random variable of finite mean, we consider the renewal sequence $T_i = X_0+\cdots + X_i$, $i \geq 0$, and corresponding renewal cluster process $ \xi(\cdot )=\sum_{i\geq0}\xi_i(\,\cdot -T_i)$. Under mild assumptions on the distribution of $(\xi,X)$, we show by coupling methods that the generalized versions of Blackwell's renewal theorem, key renewal theorem, extended renewal theorem and elementary renewal theorem still hold, even with dependence between $\xi_i$'s and $X_i$'s.</description>

We trace this ancestral line back into the distant past, far beyond the most recent common ancestor of the population (thus connecting population genetics to phylogeny), and analyse the mutation process along this line.
  To this end, we use the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph, which consists of a set of potential ancestors of the sampled individual at any given time. Relative to the neutral case (that is, without selection), we obtain a general bias towards the beneficial type, an increase in the beneficial mutation rate, and a decrease in the deleterious mutation rate. This sheds new light on previous analytical results. We discuss our findings in the light of a well-known observation at the interface of phylogeny and population genetics, namely, the difference in the mutation rates (or, more precisely, mutation fluxes) estimated via phylogenetic methods relative to those observed in pedigree studies.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of return times and related entropy estimators on shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for several entropy and cross entropy estimators based on return times and waiting times on shift spaces over finite alphabets. We consider shift-invariant probability measures satisfying some decoupling conditions which imply no form of mixing nor ergodicity. We establish precise relations between the rate functions of the different estimators, and between these rate functions and the corresponding pressures, one of which is the R\'enyi entropy function. For the most commonly used definition of return times, the large-deviation rate function is proved to be nonconvex, except in marginal cases. The results apply in particular to irreducible Markov chains, equilibrium measures for Bowen-regular potentials, g-measures, invariant Gibbs states for absolutely summable interactions in statistical mechanics, and also to probability measures which may be far from Gibbsian, including some hidden Markov models and repeated quantum measurement processes.</description>

      <title>Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Busemann process of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d. weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We demonstrate that the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution obeying a version of the geometric Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence. In the inverse-gamma case this relationship enables an explicit description of the distribution of the Busemann process: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. Various corollaries follow, including that each Busemann function has the same countably infinite dense set of discontinuities in the direction variable. This contrasts with the known zero-temperature last-passage percolation cases, where the analogous sets are nowhere dense but have a dense union. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force--one solution principle for the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics for asymmetric simple exclusion on a finite segment with Glauber-type source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an open interacting particle system on a finite lattice. The particles perform asymmetric simple exclusion and are randomly created or destroyed at all sites, with rates that grow rapidly near the boundaries. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density at the hyperbolic space-time scale and obtain the entropy solution to a boundary-driven quasilinear conservation law with a relaxation term. Different from the usual boundary conditions introduced in [Bardos, Roux, and Nedelec, (1979), Comm. Part. Diff. Equ], discontinuity (boundary layer) does not formulate at the boundaries due to the strong relaxation scheme.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver for Learning PDEs via Probabilistic Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scenarios with limited available data, training the function-to-function neural PDE solver in an unsupervised manner is essential. However, the efficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties of numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods, integrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines. The source code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/optray/MCNP.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal transport and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations on the set of probability measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic version of the optimal transport problem. We provide an analysis by means of the study of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is set on the set of probability measures. We introduce a new definition of viscosity solutions of this equation, which yields general comparison principles, in particular for cases involving terms modeling stochasticity in the optimal control problem. We are then able to establish results of existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. These results rely on controllability results for stochastic optimal transport that we also establish.</description>

      <title>An Instance-Based Approach to the Trace Reconstruction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the trace reconstruction problem, one observes the output of passing a binary string $s \in \{0,1\}^n$ through a deletion channel $T$ times and wishes to recover $s$ from the resulting $T$ "traces." Most of the literature has focused on characterizing the hardness of this problem in terms of the number of traces $T$ needed for perfect reconstruction either in the worst case or in the average case (over input sequences $s$). In this paper, we propose an alternative, instance-based approach to the problem. We define the "Levenshtein difficulty" of a problem instance $(s,T)$ as the probability that the resulting traces do not provide enough information for correct recovery with full certainty. One can then try to characterize, for a specific $s$, how $T$ needs to scale in order for the Levenshtein difficulty to go to zero, and seek reconstruction algorithms that match this scaling for each $s$. For a class of binary strings with alternating long runs, we precisely characterize the scaling of $T$ for which the Levenshtein difficulty goes to zero. For this class, we also prove that a simple "Las Vegas algorithm" has an error probability that decays to zero with the same rate as that with which the Levenshtein difficulty tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Limiting behavior of determinantal point processes associated with weighted Bergman kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $\phi$ be a strictly plurisubharmonic function on $\Omega$. For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, we consider determinantal point process $\Lambda_k$ with kernel $K_{k\phi}$, where $K_{k\phi}$ is the reproducing kernel of weighted Bergman space $H(k\phi)$ with weight $e^{-k\phi}$. We show that the limit of scaled cumulant generating function for $\Lambda_k$ converges as $k\rightarrow\infty$ to a certain limit, which can be explicitly expressed in terms of $\phi$ and a test function $u$. Note that we need to restrict the type of test function $u$ to be $\phi$-admissible.</description>

      <title>Markov generators as non-hermitian supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonians: spectral properties via bi-orthogonal basis and Singular Value Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuity equations associated to continuous-time Markov processes can be considered as Euclidean Schr\"odinger equations, where the non-hermitian quantum Hamiltonian $\bold{H}={\bold{div}}{\bold J}$ is naturally factorized into the product of the divergence operator ${\bold {div}}$ and the current operator ${\bold J}$. For non-equilibrium Markov jump processes in a space of $N$ configurations with $M$ links and $C=M-(N-1)\geq 1$ independent cycles, this factorization of the $N \times N$ Hamiltonian ${\bold H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ involves the incidence matrix ${\bold I}$ and the current matrix ${\bold J}$ of size $M \times N$, so that the supersymmetric partner ${\hat{\bold H}}= {\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ governing the dynamics of the currents living on the $M$ links is of size $M \times M$. To better understand the relations between the spectral decompositions of these two Hamiltonians $\bold{H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ and ${\hat {\bold H}} ={\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ with respect to their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors that characterize the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state and the steady currents, it is useful to analyze the properties of the Singular Value Decompositions of the two rectangular matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J} $ of size $M \times N$ and the interpretations in terms of discrete Helmholtz decompositions. This general framework concerning Markov jump processes can be adapted to non-equilibrium diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations in dimension $d$, where the number $N$ of configurations, the number $M$ of links and the number $C=M-(N-1)$ of independent cycles become infinite, while the two matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J}$ become first-order differential operators acting on scalar functions to produce vector fields.</description>
