      <title>Maximal Solutions and Stochastic Free Boundary Formulations for Stochastic Willmore and Surface Diffusion Flows on $\R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic Willmore flow and the stochastic surface diffusion flow for closed or non-closed curves on $\mathbb{R}^2$ in this paper. We equivalently formulate them as a stochastic one-phase Stefan problem (or a stochastic free boundary problem) of the curvature, which is parameterized by the arc-length, and the length of the curves. After rewriting the stochastic Stefan problem as a quasilinear parabolic evolution equation, we apply the theory for quasilinear parabolic stochastic evolution equations developed by Agresti and Veraar in 2022 to get the existence and uniqueness of a local strong solution up to a maximal stopping time that is characterized by a blow-up alternative. When the solutions blow up, the corresponding stochastic curve flows either develop singularities or shrink to a point.</description>

      <title>Global Fluctuations of Gaussian Elliptic Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a spoke-arc decomposition of non-crossing annular pair partitions $NC_2(p,q)$ that records spoke type and orientation, isolates spoke-level contributions, and factorizes the dependence on the ellipticity parameter $\gamma$ into a spoke factor and arc weights. This yields closed-form descriptions of the limiting covariance of Gaussian elliptic matrices. As a corollary, we show that an independent family of Gaussian elliptic random matrices is asymptotically second-order free.</description>

      <title>Analytic and stochastic description of Brownian motions on star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed description of all possible Feller processes on infinite} star graphs with finite number of edges, processes that while away from the graph's center behave like a one-dimensional Brownian motion. The description can be seen as a continuation of the seminal paper by It\^o and McKean (devoted to Brownian motions on the half-line), recast from the perspective of the theory of multi-armed bandits.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos in Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for proving sharp local propagation of chaos in Fisher Information for particles with smooth interaction and drift. We rely on a new Lemma computing the Fisher Information of two diffusion processes with smooth drifts and fine estimates on the hessian of the law of the solution of the McKean-Vlasov equation. It allows us to obtain a new propagation of chaos in Fisher information, generalizing Lacker's seminal work by using the BBGKY hierarchy to obtain a system of differential inequalities satisfied by both the relative entropy and the Fisher Information of k particles. We also show with a simple Gaussian example that our decay rate is optimal.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Brownian motion in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion is a building block in modern probability theory. In this paper, we describe a formalization of Brownian motion using the Lean theorem prover. We build on the existing measure-theoretic foundations in Lean's mathematical library, Mathlib, and we develop several key components needed for the construction of Brownian motion, including the Carath\'eodory and Kolmogorov extension theorems, Gaussian measures in Banach spaces, and the Kolmogorov-Chentsov theorem for path continuity.</description>

      <title>Modified Equations for Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we extend the recently introduced theory of stochastic modified equations (SMEs) for stochastic gradient optimization algorithms.
  In Ch. 3 we study time-inhomogeneous SDEs driven by Brownian motion. For certain SDEs we prove a 1st and 2nd-order weak approximation properties, and we compute their linear error terms explicitly, under certain regularity conditions. In Ch. 4 we instantiate our results for SGD, working out the example of linear regression explicitly. We use this example to compare the linear error terms of gradient flow and two commonly used 1st-order SMEs for SGD in Ch. 5.
  In the second part of the thesis we introduce and study a novel diffusion approximation for SGD without replacement (SGDo) in the finite-data setting. In Ch. 6 we motivate and define the notion of an epoched Brownian motion (EBM). We argue that Young differential equations (YDEs) driven by EBMs serve as continuous-time models for SGDo for any shuffling scheme whose induced permutations converge to a det. permuton. Further, we prove a.s. convergence for these YDEs in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we compute an upper asymptotic bound on the convergence rate which is as sharp as, or better than previous results for SGDo. In Ch. 7 we study scaling limits of families of random walks (RW) that share the same increments up to a random permutation. We show weak convergence under the assumption that the sequence of permutations converges to a det. (higher-dimensional) permuton. This permuton determines the covariance function of the limiting Gaussian process. Conversely, we show that every Gaussian process with a covariance function determined by a permuton in this way arises as a weak scaling limit of families of RW with shared increments. Finally, we apply our weak convergence theory to show that EBMs arise as scaling limits of RW with finitely many distinct increments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear weak error expansion of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Talay and Tubaro \cite{talay_expansion_1990}, the weak error between the solution to a stochastic differential equation with smooth coefficients and its Euler-Maruyama scheme can be expanded in powers of the time-step. In the present paper, we generalize this result to the case when the error is measured by a smooth functional on the Wasserstein space of probability measures in place of the linear functional given by the expectation of a smooth function considered in \cite{talay_expansion_1990}. Since this does not complicate our analysis based on the master partial differential equation, we even deal with the McKean-Vlasov case when the coefficients of the stochastic differential equation may depend on its current marginal distribution.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform-Grid Markov Chain Approximation of Continuous Processes with Time-Linear Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$-Seed-Bank-Wright-Fisher process conditioned on fixation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\Lambda$-Seed-Bank-Wright-Fisher process, a model describing allele frequency dynamics in populations exhibiting both skewed offspring distributions and dormancy. By performing a change of measure, we condition this process on the eventual fixation of a specified genetic type. The resulting process is again a $\Lambda$-Wright-Fisher process with a seed bank, but now features coordinated mutations driven by a random switching environment. Our analysis relies on two key techniques: the lookdown construction and sampling duality. These tools provide a pathwise construction of the conditioned process while preserving a means to recover the conditioned population genealogy. The resulting genealogy corresponds to a structured $\Lambda$-coalescent with coordinated mutations determined by the switching environment.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional limits arising from hyperbolic Poisson k-plane processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stationary Poisson process of $k$-planes in the $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb H^d$ of constant curvature $-1$, with $d \ge 4$ and $1 \le k \le d-1$. It is known that, after centring and normalization, the total $k$-volume of all intersections of $k$-planes with a geodesic ball of radius $R$ converges in distribution, as $R \to \infty$, to a non-Gaussian infinitely divisible random variable $Z_{d,k}$ whenever $2k &gt; d+1$. We investigate the distributional behaviour of $Z_{d,k}$ in the high-dimensional regime $d \to \infty$ and depending on how fast $k$ grows in relation to $d$. We derive precise conditions for the variance normalized sequence to converge in law to a standard Gaussian random variable or to a degenerate law, respectively, and show that an alternative rescaling of the L\'evy measures yields an explicit non-Gaussian infinitely divisible limit for fixed codimension $d-k$ and a standard Gaussian limit for $d-k \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Theory for Fractional SDE with Singular Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show existence and uniqueness of invariant measures for SDE of the form \[
  dX_t = g(X_t)dt + u(X_t)dt + dW^H_t \]
  where $W^H$ is a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst parameter $H\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, $u$ is a linearly dispersive term and $g$ is any $B^\alpha_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ distribution in the class treated by Catellier--Gubinelli `16, i.e. $\alpha&gt;1-\frac{1}{2H}$. The significant challenge is to combine the regularizing effect of the fBm with an ergodic theory suited to non-Markovian SDE. Concerning the latter our first main contribution is to construct a bona fide stochastic dynamical system (SDS) (Hairer `05 and Hairer--Ohashi `07) associated to the equation above. Since the solution map is only continuous in the support of the stationary noise process we weaken the definitions introduced by Hairer `05 and Hairer--Ohashi `07 but manage to retain the Doob--K'hashminksii provided by Hairer--Ohashi `07. Our second innovation is to introduce a family of flexible local-global stochastic sewing lemmas, in the vein of L\^e `20, which allows us to efficiently treat small and large scales simultaneously. By tuning the local scale as a function of $\|g\|_{B^\alpha_{\infty,\infty}}$ we are able to obtain the necessary continuity of the semi-group and stability estimates to show unique ergodicity for all $g\in B^{\alpha}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We believe that these local-global sewing lemmas may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Dominant-Interferer Approximation for SINR Coverage in Poisson Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate radio propagation and interference modeling is essential for the design and analysis of modern cellular networks. Stochastic geometry offers a rigorous framework by treating base station locations as a Poisson point process and enabling coverage characterization through spatial averaging, but its expressions often involve nested integrals and special functions that limit general applicability. Probabilistic interference models seek closed-form characterizations through moment-based approximations, yet these expressions remain tractable only for restricted parameter choices and become unwieldy when interference moments lack closed-form representations. This work introduces a hybrid approximation framework that addresses these challenges by combining Monte Carlo sampling of a small set of dominant interferers with a Laplace functional representation of the residual far-field interference. The resulting dominant-plus-tail structure provides a modular, numerically stable, and path-loss-agnostic estimator suitable for both noise-limited and interference-limited regimes. We further derive theoretical error bounds that decrease with the number of dominant interferers and validate the approach against established stochastic geometry and probabilistic modeling benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Population size in stochastic multi-patch ecological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at the interaction of dispersal and environmental stochasticity in $n$-patch models. We are able to prove persistence and extinction results even in the setting when the dispersal rates are stochastic. As applications we look at Beverton-Holt and Hassell functional responses. We find explicit approximations for the total population size at stationarity when we look at slow and fast dispersal. In particular, we show that if dispersal is small then in the Beverton-Holt setting, if the carrying capacity is random, then environmental fluctuations are always detrimental and decrease the total population size. Instead, in the Hassell setting, if the inverse of the carrying capacity is made random, then environmental fluctuations always increase the population size. Fast dispersal can save populations from extinction and therefore increase the total population size. We also analyze a different type of environmental fluctuation which comes from switching environmental states according to a Markov chain and find explicit approximations when the switching is either fast or slow - in examples we are able to show that slow switching leads to a higher population size than fast switching.
  Using and modifying some approximation results due to Cuello, we find expressions for the total population size in the $n=2$ patch setting when the growth rates, carrying capacities, and dispersal rates are influenced by random fluctuations. We find that there is a complicated interaction between the various terms and that the covariances between the various random parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, dispersal rate) play a key role in whether we get an increase or a decrease in the total population size. Environmental fluctuations turn to sometimes be beneficial -- this show that not only dispersal, but also environmental stochasticity can lead to an increase in population size.</description>

      <title>Structured Continuity Equations in Fibred Wasserstein Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a comprehensive ODE-theory for structured continuity equations in fibred probability spaces, which represent a class of heterogeneous PDEs arising as the meanfield limit nonexchangeable particle systems. After investigating in depth the topologies induced by the so-called fibred and classical Wasserstein metrics on such probability spaces, we establish quantitative Cauchy-Lipschitz and qualitative Carath\'eodory-Peano well-posedness results for structured continuity equations, along with precise correspondences between this class of evolutions, classical Lagrangian dynamics, and continuity equations. In keeping with what has long been known for exchangeable dynamics, we derive a general meanfield approximation result by solutions of nonexchangeable particle systems, along with a quantitative variant thereof under practically reasonable regularity assumptions on the driving field and initial data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Importance Sampling under Heston Model: Short Maturity and Deep Out-of-the-Money Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates asymptotically optimal importance sampling (IS) schemes for pricing European call options under the Heston stochastic volatility model. We focus on two distinct rare-event regimes where standard Monte Carlo methods suffer from significant variance deterioration: the limit as maturity approaches zero and the limit as the strike price tends to infinity. Leveraging the large deviation principle (LDP), we design a state-dependent change of measure derived from the asymptotic behavior of the log-price cumulant generating functions. In the short-maturity regime, we rigorously prove that our proposed IS drift, inspired by the variational characterization of the rate function, achieves logarithmic efficiency (asymptotic optimality) by minimizing the decay rate of the second moment of the estimator. In the deep OTM regime, we introduce a novel slow mean-reversion scaling for the variance process, where the mean-reversion speed scales as the inverse square of the small-noise parameter (defined as the reciprocal of the log-moneyness). We establish that under this specific scaling, the variance process contributes non-trivially to the large deviation rate function, requiring a specialized Riccati analysis to verify optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields substantial variance reduction--characterized by factors exceeding several orders of magnitude--compared to standard estimators in both asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory has become a cornerstone in modern statistics and data science, providing fundamental tools for understanding high-dimensional covariance structures. Within this framework, the Wishart matrix plays a central role in multivariate analysis and related applications. This paper investigates both the exact and asymptotic distributions of the square root of a standard Wishart matrix. We first derive the exact distribution of the square root matrix. Then, by leveraging the Bartlett decomposition, we establish the joint asymptotic normality of the upper-triangular entries of the square root matrix. The resulting limiting distribution resembles that of a scaled Gaussian Wigner ensemble. Additionally, we quantify the rate of convergence using the 1-Wasserstein distance. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate rapid convergence even with relatively low degrees of freedom. These results offer refined insights into the asymptotic behavior of random matrix functionals.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of multi-period distributionally robust optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the scaling limit of multi-period distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems via a semigroup approach. Each period involves a worst-case maximization over distributions in a Wasserstein ball around the transition probability of a reference process with radius proportional to the length of the period, and the multi-period DRO problem arises through its sequential composition. We show that the scaling limit of the multi-period DRO, as the length of each period tends to zero, is a strongly continuous monotone semigroup on $\mathrm{C_b}$. Furthermore, we show that its infinitesimal generator is equal to the generator associated with the non-robust scaling limit plus an additional perturbation term induced by the Wasserstein uncertainty. As an application, we show that when the reference process follows an It\^o process, the viscosity solution of the associated nonlinear PDE coincides with the value of continuous-time robust optimization problems under parametric uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the isentropic compressible Euler equations in multi-dimensions with stochastic perturbation of transport type. On the one hand, this is motivated by the physical modelling in turbulence theory. On the other hand, it has been shown recently that this type of noise can have regularising effects. In this paper, we prove the existence of dissipative measure-valued martingale solutions, the weak-strong uniqueness property and the existence of Markov selections.</description>

Abstract: We compute the full off-diagonal asymptotics of the equivariant and partial Bergman kernels associated with a circle action on a prequantized K\"ahler manifold with bounded geometry at infinity, then use these results to compute the asymptotics of the linear statistics of the associated determinantal point process as the number of points grows to infinity, showing that its distribution converges to a centered normal variable with variance given by the sum of an $H^1$-norm squared in the bulk and an $H^{1/2}$-norm squared on the boundary of the associated droplet.</description>

      <title>A critical drift-diffusion equation: intermittent behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process with a time-independent and divergence-free random drift that is of white-noise character. We are interested in the critical case of two space dimensions, where one has to impose a small-scale cut-off for well-posedness, and is interested in the marginally super-diffusive behavior on large scales.
  In the presence of an (artificial) large-scale cut-off at scale L, as a consequence of standard stochastic homogenization theory, there exist harmonic coordinates with a stationary gradient $F_L$; the merit of these coordinates being that under their lens, the drift-diffusion process turns into a martingale.
  It has recently been established that the second moments diverge as $\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2\sim\sqrt{\ln L}$ for $L\uparrow\infty$. We quantitatively show that in this limit, and in the regime of small P\'eclet number, $|F_L|^2/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2$ is not equi-integrable, and that $\mathbb{E}|{\rm det}F_L|/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2 $ is small. Hence the Jacobian matrix of the harmonic coordinates is very peaked and non-conformal.
  We establish this asymptotic behavior by characterizing a proxy $\tilde F_L$ introduced in previous work as the solution of an It\^{o} SDE w. r. t. the variable $\ln L$, and which implements the concept of a scale-by-scale homogenization based on a variance decomposition and admits an efficient calculus. For this proxy, we establish $\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^4\gg(\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^2)^2$ and $\mathbb{E}({\rm det}\tilde F_L-1)^2\ll 1$. In view of the former property, we assimilate this phenomenon to intermittency. In fact, $\tilde F_L$ behaves like a tensorial stochastic exponential, and as a field can be assimilated to multiplicative Gaussian chaos.</description>

Abstract: Darboux transformation of a second-order linear differential operator is a well-known technique with many applications in mathematics and physics. We study Darboux transformation from the point of view of Markov semigroups of diffusion processes. We construct the Darboux transform of a diffusion process through a combination of Doob's $h$-transform and a version of Siegmund duality. Our main result is a simple formula that connects transition probability densities of the two processes. We provide several examples of Darboux transformed diffusion processes related to Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. For these examples, we compute explicitly the transition probability density and derive its spectral representation.</description>

      <title>A generalised spatial branching process with ancestral branching to model the growth of a filamentous fungus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a spatial branching process to model the growth of the mycelial network of a filamentous fungus. In this model, each filament is described by the position of its tip, the trajectory of which is solution to a stochastic differential equation with a drift term which depends on all the other trajectories. Each filament can branch either at its tip or along its length, that is to say at some past position of its tip, at some time- and space-dependent rates. It can stop growing at some rate which also depends on the positions of the other tips. We first construct the measure-valued process corresponding to this dynamics, then we study its large population limit and we characterise the limiting process as the weak solution to a system of partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence and conditional uniqueness in the Krylov class for SDEs with singular divergence-free drifts in the endpoint critical Lorentz space $L^{\infty}(0,T; L^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$, $d \geqslant 2$, which particularly includes the $2$D Biot-Savart law. The uniqueness result is shown to be optimal in dimensions $d \geqslant 3$, by constructing different martingale solutions in the case of supercritical Lorentz drifts. As a consequence, the well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with critical singular kernels is derived. In particular, this yields the uniqueness of the $2$D vorticity Navier-Stokes equations even in certain supercritical-scaling spaces. Furthermore, we prove that the path laws of solutions to McKean-Vlasov equations with critical singular kernel form a nonlinear Markov process in the sense of McKean.</description>

      <title>Deep BSVIEs Parametrization and Learning-Based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their reflected extensions, which naturally arise in problems with time inconsistency, path dependent preferences, and recursive utilities with memory. These equations generalize classical BSDEs by involving two dimensional time structures and more intricate dependencies.
  We begin by developing a well posedness and measurability framework for BSVIEs in product probability spaces. Our approach relies on a representation of the solution as a parametrized family of backward stochastic equations indexed by the initial time, and draws on results of Stricker and Yor to ensure that the two parameter solution is well defined in a joint measurable sense.
  We then introduce a discrete time learning scheme based on a recursive backward representation of the BSVIE, combining the discretization of Hamaguchi and Taguchi with deep neural networks. A detailed convergence analysis is provided, generalizing the framework of deep BSDE solvers to the two dimensional BSVIE setting. Finally, we extend the solver to reflected BSVIEs, motivated by applications in delayed recursive utility with lower constraints.</description>

      <title>Explicit Universal Bounds for Cumulants via Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish explicit, universal, and distribution-free bounds for the $n$-th cumulant, $\kappa_n(X)$, of a scalar random variable, controlled solely by an $n$-th order absolute moment functional $M_n(X)$. The bounds take the form $\lvert\kappa_n(X)\rvert \le C_n M_n(X)$. Our principal contribution is the derivation of coefficients satisfying $C_n \sim (n-1)!/\rho^{\,n}$, which offers an exponential improvement over classical bounds where the coefficients grow superexponentially (on the order of $n^n$).
  We present a hierarchy of refinements where the rate parameter $\rho$ increases as the functional $M_n(X)$ incorporates more structural information. The most general bound uses the raw moment $M_n(X)=\mathsf{E}[\lvert X\rvert^n]$ with rate $\rho=\ln 2 \approx 0.693$. Using the central moment $M_n(X)=\mathsf{E}[\lvert X-\mathsf{E}[X]\rvert^n]$ improves the rate to $\rho_{\mathrm{cen}} \approx 1.146$, while assuming symmetry yields even higher rates.
  The proof is elementary, combining the moment-cumulant partition formula with a uniform moment-product inequality. We further prove that while these bounds are strict (not attainable by non-degenerate distributions), they are asymptotically efficient given the limited information of a single moment. The utility of the bounds is demonstrated through applications to analyticity of CGFs and concentration inequalities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study second order fluctuations for the size of the range of a critical branching random walk (BRW) in $\mathbb Z^d$. We consider the BRW with geometric offspring indexed by the Kesten tree, and show that the size of its range has linear variance when $d&gt;8$, and satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) with Gaussian limiting distribution when $d&gt;16$. The proof combines the stationarity of the model under depth-first exploration, the general CLT of Dedecker and Merlev\`ede [7], a truncation scheme exploiting the local independence of the tree, and a recursive method for controlling moments.</description>

      <title>Same-day or next-day? Transparent time-dependent shipment pricing for e-fulfillment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a parsimonious model of an e-commerce fulfillment center that offers time-dependent shipment options and corresponding fees to utility-maximizing customers arriving according to a Poisson process. For any such policy, we provide an exact steady-state analysis using the underlying periodic Markov chain to characterize system performance. Because shipment fees shape both the volume and timing of same-day demand, direct optimization over the price domain is analytically intractable. To enable structural and computational insights, we introduce a transformation that maps each shipment-fee policy to its induced cumulative demand profile. This reformulation reveals that the optimal policy features a cutoff time and monotonically increasing fees, and it yields a supermodular profit function that can be optimized in polynomial time. We also propose a simple two-level time-dependent fee structure that is intuitive for customers and achieves near-optimal performance. Numerical experiments show that introducing a cutoff time substantially improves profits under static fees, and that using time-dependent fees produces further significant gains. Overall, transparent time-dependent shipment policies help firms align same-day demand with fulfillment capacity while maintaining transparency and fairness for customers.</description>

Abstract: For each of the four particle processes given by Dieker and Warren [arXiv:0707.1843], we show the $n$-step transition kernels are given by the (dual) (weak) refined symmetric Grothendieck functions up to a simple overall factor. We do so by encoding the particle dynamics as the basis of free fermions first introduced by the first author, which we translate into deformed Schur operators acting on partitions. We provide a direct combinatorial proof of this relationship in each case, where the defining tableaux naturally describe the particle motions.</description>

Abstract: Caffarelli's contraction theorem bounds the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-convex measure and a strongly log-concave measure. We show that an analogous phenomenon holds on the level of the trace: The trace of the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-subharmonic measure and a strongly log-concave measure is bounded. We show that this trace bound has a number of consequences pertaining to volume-contracting transport maps, majorization and its monotonicity along Wasserstein geodesics, growth estimates of log-subharmonic functions, the Wehrl conjecture for Glauber states, and two-dimensional Coulomb gases. We also discuss volume-contraction properties for the Kim-Milman transport map</description>

      <title>The Return Times Theorem, Auto-Correlation and Sequences with an Empty Fourier-Bohr Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the proof by J. Bourgain, H. Furstenberg, Y. Katznelson and D.S. Ornstein of their return times theorem [2] and lights a corner in it regarding the role of auto-correlation. As for pointwise convergence, this was already observed in [5], and here we exploit the opportunity to write down the proof. This yields a more intrinsic characterization of the sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem. Then we proceed and obtain a characterization linked to auto-correlation also to sequences satisfying the mean theorem - by that theorem those were already known to be exactly the sequences with an empty Fourier-Bohr spectrum. Some further investigation is done and examples are provided regarding generic sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem for which the measure on the circle that the auto-correlation function represents (by Fourier transform) is not atomless, and also regarding the existence of sequences that satisfy the mean theorem but not the pointwise one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-time stochastic drift control problem with the assumption that the control is bounded and the system is controlled until the state process leaves the half-line. Assuming general conditions, it is proved that the resulting parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation has a classical solution. In fact, we consider an even more general family of semilinear equations, which might be helpful in solving other control or game problems. Not only is the existence result proved, but also a recursive procedure for finding a solution resulting from a fixed-point argument is provided.</description>

      <title>The fermionic DGFF and its scaling limit logCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify the scaling limit of the fermionic discrete Gaussian free field (fDGFF) as a logarithmic conformal field theory (CFT) in two dimensions. We first establish a one-to-one correspondence between the space of local observables of the fDGFF and the space of local fields of the symplectic fermions CFT, a logarithmic CFT with central charge $c = - 2$. This correspondence is meaningful in the sense that, when appropriately renormalised, the fDGFF correlation functions converge to corresponding CFT correlation functions in the scaling limit. As an application to these results, we interpret (the scaling limit of) certain local observables in the uniform spanning tree and the Abelian sandpile model as local fields of the symplectic fermions.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and at each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by averaging their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that the smallest number of steps is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$ when the initial opinions are in a general position. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps. In particular, we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>
