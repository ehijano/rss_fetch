      <title>Hyperrigidity I: operator moments and convergence of subnormal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, the concept of hyperrigidity can be expressed in many ways. We provide four main approaches to this issue. The first one is via semispectral measures in the spirit of the characterizations of spectral measures. The second approach is based on dilation theory and is written in terms of the Stone-von Neumann calculus for normal operators. The third is inspired by Brown's theorem and deals with the weak and strong convergence of sequences of subnormal (or normal) operators. Finally, the fourth approach concerns multiplicativity of UCP maps on $C^*$-subalgebras generated by normal elements. This is inspired by the Petz's theorem and its generalizations established first by Arveson in the finite-dimensional case and then by Brown in general. Next, we will examine, in the case of a unital commutative $C^*$-algebra $\mathscr{A}$ generated by a single element $t$, which subsets $G$ of the set $\{t^{*m}t^n : (m, n) \in \mathbb{Z}^2\}$ are hyperrigid in $\mathscr{A}$.</description>

      <title>Isotropy fibers of ideals in groupoid C$^{*}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a locally compact \'etale groupoid and an ideal $I$ in its groupoid C$^*$-algebra, we show that $I$ defines a family of ideals in group C$^*$-algebras of the isotropy groups and then study to which extent $I$ is determined by this family. As an application we obtain the following results: (a) prove that every proper ideal is contained in an induced primitive ideal; (b) describe the maximal ideals; (c) classify the primitive ideals for a class of graded groupoids with essentially central isotropy.</description>

      <title>The primitive spectrum of C*-algebras of etale groupoids with abelian isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Hausdorff locally compact \'etale groupoid $\mathcal G$, we describe as a topological space the part of the primitive spectrum of $C^*(\mathcal G)$ obtained by inducing one-dimensional representations of amenable isotropy groups of $\mathcal G$. When $\mathcal G$ is amenable, second countable, with abelian isotropy groups, our result gives the description of $\operatorname{Prim} C^*(\mathcal G)$ conjectured by van Wyk and Williams. This, in principle, completely determines the ideal structure of a large class of separable C$^*$-algebras, including the transformation group C$^*$-algebras defined by amenable actions of discrete groups with abelian stabilizers and the C$^*$-algebras of higher rank graphs.</description>
