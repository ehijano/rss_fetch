      <title>BioModelsRAG: A Biological Modeling Assistant Using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BioModels database is one of the premier databases for computational models in systems biology. The database contains over 1000 curated models and an even larger number of non-curated models. All the models are stored in the machine-readable format, SBML. Although SBML can be translated into the human readable Antimony format, analyzing the models can still be time consuming. In order to bridge this gap, a LLM (large language model) assistant was created to analyze the BioModels and allow interaction between the user and the model using natural language. By doing so, a user can easily and rapidly extract the salient points in a given model. Our analysis workflow involved 'chunking' BioModels and converting them to plain text using llama3, and then embedding them in a ChromaDB database. The user-provided query was also embedded, and a similarity search was performed between the query and the BioModels in ChromaDB to extract the most relevant BioModels. The BioModels were then used as context to create the most accurate output in the chat between the user and the LLM. This approach greatly minimized the chance of hallucination and kept the LLM focused on the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of attractor transitions in Boolean networks under noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems operate under persistent noise, which can alter system states and induce transitions between attractors. Here, we study the attractor dynamics of Boolean networks focusing on the transitions between attractors induced by noise. By computing transition probabilities between attractors, we present methods at the attractor level to determine dominance, stability, and diversity of attractors, and systematically compare local and global noise. Whereas global noise leads to attractor behavior dictated primarily by basin sizes, local noise produces structured transition patterns characterized by enhanced stability, non-trivial dominance patterns, and broader exploration of the attractor space. Our work offers insight into the dynamics of attractors, showing the importance of transition patterns under noise.</description>
