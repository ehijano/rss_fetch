      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Melanoma Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, necessitating advancements in early detection and treatment technologies. In this paper, we present a novel and highly efficient melanoma detection framework that synergistically combines the strengths of U-Net for segmentation and EfficientNet for the classification of skin images. The primary objective of our study is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of melanoma detection through an innovative hybrid approach. We utilized the HAM10000 dataset to meticulously train the U-Net model, enabling it to precisely segment cancerous regions. Concurrently, we employed the ISIC 2020 dataset to train the EfficientNet model, optimizing it for the binary classification of skin cancer. Our hybrid model demonstrates a significant improvement in performance, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.01% on the ISIC 2020 dataset. This exceptional result underscores the superiority of our approach compared to existing model structures. By integrating the precise segmentation capabilities of U-Net with the advanced classification prowess of EfficientNet, our framework offers a comprehensive solution for melanoma detection. The results of our extensive experiments highlight the high accuracy and reliability of our method in both segmentation and classification tasks. This indicates the potential of our hybrid approach to significantly enhance cancer detection, providing a robust tool for medical professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of melanoma. We believe that our framework can set a new benchmark in the field of automated skin cancer detection, encouraging further research and development in this crucial area of medical imaging.</description>

      <title>LightViz: Autonomous Light-field Surveying and Mapping for Distributed Light Pollution Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing technologies for distributed light-field mapping and light pollution monitoring (LPM) rely on either remote satellite imagery or manual light surveying with single-point sensors such as SQMs (sky quality meters). These modalities offer low-resolution data that are not informative for dense light-field mapping, pollutant factor identification, or sustainable policy implementation. In this work, we propose LightViz -- an interactive software interface to survey, simulate, and visualize light pollution maps in real-time. As opposed to manual error-prone methods, LightViz (i) automates the light-field data collection and mapping processes; (ii) provides a platform to simulate various light sources and intensity attenuation models; and (iii) facilitates effective policy identification for conservation.
  To validate the end-to-end computational pipeline, we design a distributed light-field sensor suit, collect data on Florida coasts, and visualize the distributed light-field maps. In particular, we perform a case study at St. Johns County in Florida, which has a two-decade conservation program for lighting ordinances. The experimental results demonstrate that LightViz can offer high-resolution light-field mapping and provide interactive features to simulate and formulate community policies for light pollution mitigation. We also propose a mathematical formulation for light footprint evaluation, which we integrated into LightViz for targeted LPM in vulnerable communities.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled sensor fusion of time of flight imaging and mmwave for concealed metal detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of detection and ranging, multiple complementary sensing modalities may be used to enrich the information obtained from a dynamic scene. One application of this sensor fusion is in public security and surveillance, whose efficacy and privacy protection measures must be continually evaluated. We present a novel deployment of sensor fusion for the discrete detection of concealed metal objects on persons whilst preserving their privacy. This is achieved by coupling off-the-shelf mmWave radar and depth camera technology with a novel neural network architecture that processes the radar signals using convolutional Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) blocks and the depth signal, using convolutional operations. The combined latent features are then magnified using a deep feature magnification to learn cross-modality dependencies in the data. We further propose a decoder, based on the feature extraction and embedding block, to learn an efficient upsampling of the latent space to learn the location of the concealed object in the spatial domain through radar feature guidance. We demonstrate the detection of presence and inference of 3D location of concealed metal objects with an accuracy of up to 95%, using a technique that is robust to multiple persons. This work provides a demonstration of the potential for cost effective and portable sensor fusion, with strong opportunities for further development.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Diffusion-based Morphing Model for X-ray Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that significantly affects the mobility of older adults. In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.</description>

      <title>CIResDiff: A Clinically-Informed Residual Diffusion Model for Predicting Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00938v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progression of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) significantly correlates with higher patient mortality rates. Early detection of IPF progression is critical for initiating timely treatment, which can effectively slow down the advancement of the disease. However, the current clinical criteria define disease progression requiring two CT scans with a one-year interval, presenting a dilemma: a disease progression is identified only after the disease has already progressed. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel diffusion model to accurately predict the progression of IPF by generating patient's follow-up CT scan from the initial CT scan. Specifically, from the clinical prior knowledge, we tailor improvements to the traditional diffusion model and propose a Clinically-Informed Residual Diffusion model, called CIResDiff. The key innovations of CIResDiff include 1) performing the target region pre-registration to align the lung regions of two CT scans at different time points for reducing the generation difficulty, 2) adopting the residual diffusion instead of traditional diffusion to enable the model focus more on differences (i.e., lesions) between the two CT scans rather than the largely identical anatomical content, and 3) designing the clinically-informed process based on CLIP technology to integrate lung function information which is highly relevant to diagnosis into the reverse process for assisting generation. Extensive experiments on clinical data demonstrate that our approach can outperform state-of-the-art methods and effectively predict the progression of IPF.</description>

      <title>A dual-task mutual learning framework for predicting post-thrombectomy cerebral hemorrhage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ischemic stroke is a severe condition caused by the blockage of brain blood vessels, and can lead to the death of brain tissue due to oxygen deprivation. Thrombectomy has become a common treatment choice for ischemic stroke due to its immediate effectiveness. But, it carries the risk of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage. Clinically, multiple CT scans within 0-72 hours post-surgery are used to monitor for hemorrhage. However, this approach exposes radiation dose to patients, and may delay the detection of cerebral hemorrhage. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel prediction framework for measuring postoperative cerebral hemorrhage using only the patient's initial CT scan. Specifically, we introduce a dual-task mutual learning framework to takes the initial CT scan as input and simultaneously estimates both the follow-up CT scan and prognostic label to predict the occurrence of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage. Our proposed framework incorporates two attention mechanisms, i.e., self-attention and interactive attention. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus more on high-density areas in the image, which are critical for diagnosis (i.e., potential hemorrhage areas). The interactive attention mechanism further models the dependencies between the interrelated generation and classification tasks, enabling both tasks to perform better than the case when conducted individually. Validated on clinical data, our method can generate follow-up CT scans better than state-of-the-art methods, and achieves an accuracy of 86.37% in predicting follow-up prognostic labels. Thus, our work thus contributes to the timely screening of post-thrombectomy cerebral hemorrhage, and could significantly reform the clinical process of thrombectomy and other similar operations related to stroke.</description>

      <title>PINNs for Medical Image Analysis: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incorporation of physical information in machine learning frameworks is transforming medical image analysis (MIA). By integrating fundamental knowledge and governing physical laws, these models achieve enhanced robustness and interpretability. In this work, we explore the utility of physics-informed approaches for MIA (PIMIA) tasks such as registration, generation, classification, and reconstruction. We present a systematic literature review of over 80 papers on physics-informed methods dedicated to MIA. We propose a unified taxonomy to investigate what physics knowledge and processes are modelled, how they are represented, and the strategies to incorporate them into MIA models. We delve deep into a wide range of image analysis tasks, from imaging, generation, prediction, inverse imaging (super-resolution and reconstruction), registration, and image analysis (segmentation and classification). For each task, we thoroughly examine and present in a tabular format the central physics-guided operation, the region of interest (with respect to human anatomy), the corresponding imaging modality, the dataset used for model training, the deep network architecture employed, and the primary physical process, equation, or principle utilized. Additionally, we also introduce a novel metric to compare the performance of PIMIA methods across different tasks and datasets. Based on this review, we summarize and distil our perspectives on the challenges, open research questions, and directions for future research. We highlight key open challenges in PIMIA, including selecting suitable physics priors and establishing a standardized benchmarking platform.</description>

      <title>Pre-processing and quality control of large clinical CT head datasets for intracranial arterial calcification segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a potential non-invasive biomarker for ischaemic stroke, intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) could be used for stroke risk assessment on CT head scans routinely acquired for other reasons (e.g. trauma, confusion). Artificial intelligence methods can support IAC scoring, but they have not yet been developed for clinical imaging. Large heterogeneous clinical CT datasets are necessary for the training of such methods, but they exhibit expected and unexpected data anomalies. Using CTs from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3), we propose a pipeline that uses as input non-enhanced CT scans to output regions of interest capturing selected large intracranial arteries for IAC scoring. Our method uses co-registration with templates. We focus on quality control, using information presence along the z-axis of the imaging to group and apply similarity measures (structural similarity index measure) to triage assessment of individual image series. Additionally, we propose superimposing thresholded binary masks of the series to inspect large quantities of data in parallel. We identify and exclude unrecoverable samples and registration failures. In total, our pipeline processes 10,659 CT series, rejecting 4,322 (41%) in the entire process, 1,450 (14% of the total) during quality control, and outputting 6,337 series. Our pipeline enables effective and efficient region of interest localisation for targeted IAC segmentation.</description>

      <title>3DPX: Progressive 2D-to-3D Oral Image Reconstruction with Hybrid MLP-CNN Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoramic X-ray (PX) is a prevalent modality in dental practice for its wide availability and low cost. However, as a 2D projection image, PX does not contain 3D anatomical information, and therefore has limited use in dental applications that can benefit from 3D information, e.g., tooth angular misa-lignment detection and classification. Reconstructing 3D structures directly from 2D PX has recently been explored to address limitations with existing methods primarily reliant on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for direct 2D-to-3D mapping. These methods, however, are unable to correctly infer depth-axis spatial information. In addition, they are limited by the in-trinsic locality of convolution operations, as the convolution kernels only capture the information of immediate neighborhood pixels. In this study, we propose a progressive hybrid Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-CNN pyra-mid network (3DPX) for 2D-to-3D oral PX reconstruction. We introduce a progressive reconstruction strategy, where 3D images are progressively re-constructed in the 3DPX with guidance imposed on the intermediate recon-struction result at each pyramid level. Further, motivated by the recent ad-vancement of MLPs that show promise in capturing fine-grained long-range dependency, our 3DPX integrates MLPs and CNNs to improve the semantic understanding during reconstruction. Extensive experiments on two large datasets involving 464 studies demonstrate that our 3DPX outperforms state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D oral reconstruction methods, including standalone MLP and transformers, in reconstruction quality, and also im-proves the performance of downstream angular misalignment classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A trained attention-based transformer network can robustly recover the complex topologies given by the Richtmyer-Meshkoff instability from a sequence of hydrodynamic features derived from radiographic images corrupted with blur, scatter, and noise. This approach is demonstrated on ICF-like double shell hydrodynamic simulations. The key component of this network is a transformer encoder that acts on a sequence of features extracted from noisy radiographs. This encoder includes numerous self-attention layers that act to learn temporal dependencies in the input sequences and increase the expressiveness of the model. This approach is demonstrated to exhibit an excellent ability to accurately recover the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability growth rates, even despite the gas-metal interface being greatly obscured by radiographic noise.</description>

      <title>WaveMamba: Spatial-Spectral Wavelet Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has proven to be a powerful tool for capturing detailed spectral and spatial information across diverse applications. Despite the advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI Classification (HSIC), challenges such as computational efficiency and the need for extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel approach that integrates wavelet transformation with the Spatial-Spectral Mamba architecture to enhance HSIC. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns and global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The Wavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space architecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies. The experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\% on the University of Houston dataset and a 2.0\% increase on the Pavia University dataset. These findings validate its effectiveness in addressing the complex data interactions inherent in HSIs.</description>

      <title>Out-Of-Distribution Detection for Audio-visual Generalized Zero-Shot Learning: A General Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is a challenging task requiring accurate classification of both seen and unseen classes. Within this domain, Audio-visual GZSL emerges as an extremely exciting yet difficult task, given the inclusion of both visual and acoustic features as multi-modal inputs. Existing efforts in this field mostly utilize either embedding-based or generative-based methods. However, generative training is difficult and unstable, while embedding-based methods often encounter domain shift problem. Thus, we find it promising to integrate both methods into a unified framework to leverage their advantages while mitigating their respective disadvantages. Our study introduces a general framework employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, aiming to harness the strengths of both approaches. We first employ generative adversarial networks to synthesize unseen features, enabling the training of an OOD detector alongside classifiers for seen and unseen classes. This detector determines whether a test feature belongs to seen or unseen classes, followed by classification utilizing separate classifiers for each feature type. We test our framework on three popular audio-visual datasets and observe a significant improvement comparing to existing state-of-the-art works. Codes can be found in https://github.com/liuyuan-wen/AV-OOD-GZSL.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformers have garnered significant attention for Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSIC) due to their self-attention mechanism, which provides strong classification performance. However, these models face major challenges in computational efficiency, as their complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. The Mamba architecture, leveraging a State Space Model, offers a more efficient alternative to Transformers. This paper introduces the Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba (MorpMamba) model. In the MorpMamba model, a token generation module first converts the Hyperspectral Image (HSI) patch into spatial-spectral tokens. These tokens are then processed by a morphology block, which computes structural and shape information using depthwise separable convolutional operations. The extracted information is enhanced in a feature enhancement module that adjusts the spatial and spectral tokens based on the center region of the HSI sample, allowing for effective information fusion within each block. Subsequently, the tokens are refined in a multi-head self-attention block to further improve the feature space. Finally, the combined information is fed into the state space block for classification and the creation of the ground truth map. Experiments on widely used Hyperspectral (HS) datasets demonstrate that the MorpMamba model outperforms (parametric efficiency) both CNN and Transformer models.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the growing theoretical understanding of neural networks that employ the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as their activation function, we revisit the use of ReLU activation functions for learning implicit neural representations (INRs). Inspired by second order B-spline wavelets, we incorporate a set of simple constraints to the ReLU neurons in each layer of a deep neural network (DNN) to remedy the spectral bias. This in turn enables its use for various INR tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, one can learn state-of-the-art INRs based on a DNN composed of only ReLU neurons. Next, by leveraging recent theoretical works which characterize the kinds of functions ReLU neural networks learn, we provide a way to quantify the regularity of the learned function. This offers a principled approach to selecting the hyperparameters in INR architectures. We substantiate our claims through experiments in signal representation, super resolution, and computed tomography, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method. The code for all experiments can be found at https://github.com/joeshenouda/relu-inrs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Spatial-spectral Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is an essential procedure for HSI applications. Unfortunately, the existing Transformer-based methods mainly focus on non-local modeling, neglecting the importance of locality in image denoising. Moreover, deep learning methods employ complex spectral learning mechanisms, thus introducing large computation costs.
  To address these problems, we propose a hybrid spatial-spectral denoising network (HSSD), in which we design a novel hybrid dual-path network inspired by CNN and Transformer characteristics, leading to capturing both local and non-local spatial details while suppressing noise efficiently. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity, we adopt a simple but effective decoupling strategy that disentangles the learning of space and spectral channels, where multilayer perception with few parameters is utilized to learn the global correlations among spectra. The synthetic and real experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on spatial and spectral reconstruction. The code and details are available on https://github.com/HLImg/HSSD.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Learned Image Compression: Context is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since LIC has made rapid progress recently compared to traditional methods, this paper attempts to discuss the question about 'Where is the boundary of Learned Image Compression(LIC)?'. Thus this paper splits the above problem into two sub-problems:1)Where is the boundary of rate-distortion performance of PSNR? 2)How to further improve the compression gain and achieve the boundary? Therefore this paper analyzes the effectiveness of scaling parameters for encoder, decoder and context model, which are the three components of LIC. Then we conclude that scaling for LIC is to scale for context model and decoder within LIC. Extensive experiments demonstrate that overfitting can actually serve as an effective context. By optimizing the context, this paper further improves PSNR and achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing a performance gain of 14.39% with BD-RATE over VVC.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Super-resolution Ultrasound Imaging with Spatiotemporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20407</link>

Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound imaging (SRUS) is an active area of research as it brings up to a ten-fold improvement in the resolution of microvascular structures. The limitations to the clinical adoption of SRUS include long acquisition times and long image processing times. Both these limitations can be alleviated with deep learning approaches to the processing of SRUS images. In this study we propose an optimized architecture based on modern improvements to convolutional neural networks from the ConvNeXt architecture and further customize the choice of features to improve performance on the specific tasks of both MB detection and localization within a single network. We employ a spatiotemporal input of up to five successive image frames to increase the number of MBs detected. The output structure produces three classifications: a MB detection Boolean for each pixel in the central image frame, as well as x and z offsets at 4-fold subpixel resolution for each MB detected. Ultrasound simulations generated images based on the L22-14v transducer (Verasonics) for training and testing of the proposed SRUS-ConvNeXt network. In vivo image data of a mouse brain was used as further validation of the architecture. The proposed network had the highest performance as measured by F1 score when configured for a 3-frame spatiotemporal input. The smallest localization error of {\lambda}/22 was achieved when the network was configured for a single input frame. The flexibility of the proposed architecture allows extension to 10-fold upscaling for SRUS images with a much lower impact to number of parameters and subsequent increase in inference time than typical U-Net style approaches. This network is promising in the quest to develop a SRUS deep network architecture for real time image formation.</description>

      <title>Sentinel-1 SAR Based Weakly Supervised Learning For Tropical Forest Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tropical forests play an important role in regulating the global carbon cycle and are crucial for maintaining the tropical forest biodiversity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to map the extent of tropical forest ecosystems. Recently, deep learning has come out as a powerful tool to map these ecosystems with the caveat of curating high quality reference datasets. Since, manually annotating high quality reference datasets is time consuming and expensive, weakly supervised learning techniques offer the potential to train high quality models without the need for manually annotating large quantities of reference datasets. In this manuscript, we propose two weakly supervised approaches that are based on Sentinel-1 SAR images, sparsely distributed pixel-wise high quality reference labels and densely distributed noisy reference labels. The proposed approaches were tested in a tropical setting in the Brazilian amazon. The results demonstrate that high quality tropical forest maps can be derived from weakly supervised learning without the need for manually annotated labels.</description>

      <title>SPIdepth: Strengthened Pose Information for Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has garnered considerable attention for its applications in autonomous driving and robotics. While recent methods have made strides in leveraging techniques like the Self Query Layer (SQL) to infer depth from motion, they often overlook the potential of strengthening pose information. In this paper, we introduce SPIdepth, a novel approach that prioritizes enhancing the pose network for improved depth estimation. Building upon the foundation laid by SQL, SPIdepth emphasizes the importance of pose information in capturing fine-grained scene structures. By enhancing the pose network's capabilities, SPIdepth achieves remarkable advancements in scene understanding and depth estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as KITTI, Cityscapes, and Make3D showcase SPIdepth's state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by significant margins. Specifically, SPIdepth tops the self-supervised KITTI benchmark. Additionally, SPIdepth achieves the lowest AbsRel (0.029), SqRel (0.069), and RMSE (1.394) on KITTI, establishing new state-of-the-art results. On Cityscapes, SPIdepth shows improvements over SQLdepth of 21.7% in AbsRel, 36.8% in SqRel, and 16.5% in RMSE, even without using motion masks. On Make3D, SPIdepth in zero-shot outperforms all other models. Remarkably, SPIdepth achieves these results using only a single image for inference, surpassing even methods that utilize video sequences for inference, thus demonstrating its efficacy and efficiency in real-world applications. Our approach represents a significant leap forward in self-supervised monocular depth estimation, underscoring the importance of strengthening pose information for advancing scene understanding in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>D-Rax: Domain-specific Radiologic assistant leveraging multi-modal data and eXpert model predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have progressed incredibly from research to applicability for general-purpose use cases. LLaVA-Med, a pioneering large language and vision assistant for biomedicine, can perform multi-modal biomedical image and data analysis to provide a natural language interface for radiologists. While it is highly generalizable and works with multi-modal data, it is currently limited by well-known challenges that exist in the large language model space. Hallucinations and imprecision in responses can lead to misdiagnosis which currently hinder the clinical adaptability of VLMs. To create precise, user-friendly models in healthcare, we propose D-Rax -- a domain-specific, conversational, radiologic assistance tool that can be used to gain insights about a particular radiologic image. In this study, we enhance the conversational analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images to support radiological reporting, offering comprehensive insights from medical imaging and aiding in the formulation of accurate diagnosis. D-Rax is achieved by fine-tuning the LLaVA-Med architecture on our curated enhanced instruction-following data, comprising of images, instructions, as well as disease diagnosis and demographic predictions derived from MIMIC-CXR imaging data, CXR-related visual question answer (VQA) pairs, and predictive outcomes from multiple expert AI models. We observe statistically significant improvement in responses when evaluated for both open and close-ended conversations. Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art diagnostic models combined with VLMs, D-Rax empowers clinicians to interact with medical images using natural language, which could potentially streamline their decision-making process, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and conserve their time.</description>
