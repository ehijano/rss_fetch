      <title>Self-sustained frictional cooling in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling processes in nature are typically generated by external contact with a cold reservoir or bath. According to the laws of thermodynamics, the final temperature of a system is determined by the temperature of the environment. Here, we report a spontaneous internal cooling phenomenon for active particles, occurring without external contact. This effect, termed ``self-sustained frictional cooling'', arises from the interplay between activity and dry (Coulomb) friction, and in addition is self-sustained from particles densely caged by their neighbors. If an active particle moves in its cage, dry friction will stop any further motion after a collision with a neighbor particle thus cooling the particle down to an extremely low temperature. We demonstrate and verify this self-sustained cooling through experiments and simulations on active granular robots and identify dense frictional arrested clusters coexisting with hot, dilute regions. Our findings offer potential applications in two-dimensional swarm robotics, where activity and dry friction can serve as externally tunable mechanisms to regulate the swarm's dynamical and structural properties.</description>

      <title>State-dependent friction for a moving liquid contact line over rough solid surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid friction between two rough surfaces is often observed to increase logarithmically over time due to contact creeping. An intriguing question is whether a similar aging effect occurs in contact line (CL) friction over rough substrates. Here, we report a systematic experimental study of CL friction using a hanging-fiber atomic force microscope (AFM) to measure the frictional force as a liquid CL moves across a fiber surface with different coatings under a well-controlled time protocol. State- (or time-)dependent CL friction is observed for the fiber surface with different textures in both the advancing and receding directions. The experimental findings are explained by a phenomenological model that links mesoscale CL friction to the microscopic relaxation of metastable air bubbles or liquid droplets trapped in the interstices of a rough surface. This model offers a general aging mechanism relevant to a wide range of liquid-solid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stiff filaments in size-polydisperse hard sphere fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a stiff filament (made by connecting beads) embedded in size-polydisperse hard sphere fluid is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations with focus on how the degree of size-polydispersity, characterized by polydispersity index ($\delta$), affects the dynamics in this model heterogeneous system. Polydispersity of the fluid as well as strong coupling of rotational and translational motion of the rods are two of the various hurdles in interpreting the experimental results in a complex fluid environment. Furthermore, influence of volume fraction, $\phi$, and absolute free volume, $V_{\rm free}$, which changes inherently with $\delta$ on the dynamics are not adequately discussed in the literature. Thus, we investigate the dynamical behaviour of the rods under two different conditions: (i) constant pressure (in which $\phi$ changes with $\delta$), and (ii) constant $\phi$. Under constant pressure it is observed that the rotational relaxation time and hence the diffusion constant, $D_R$, varies with rod length as $D_R \sim l^{-\alpha}$, where the value of exponent $\alpha$ increases from $3.0-3.2$ while varying $\delta$ from $0-40\%$. It is observed that the effect of increasing $\phi$ dominates over the effect of increasing $V_{\rm free}$. Also there is minimal effect of hydrodynamic interaction among the beads belonging to a rod during rotation, whereas the presence of partial hydrodynamic screening for the motion of the centre of mass is seen. On the other hand, for fixed $\phi$ systems, increasing $\delta$ results in increasing $V_{\rm free}$ and thus enhances tracer diffusion, an opposite trend compared to the system under constant pressure.</description>

      <title>Universal law for the dispersal of motile microorganisms in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersal is essential to the plethora of motile microorganisms living in porous environments, yet how it relates to movement patterns and pore space structure remains largely unknown. Here we investigate numerically the long-time dispersal of a run-and-tumble microorganism that remains trapped at solid surfaces and escapes from them by tumbling. We find that dispersal and mean run time are connected by a universal relation, that applies for a variety of porous microstructures and swimming strategies. We explain how this generic dependence originates in the invariance of the mean free path with respect to the movement pattern, and we discuss the optimal strategy that maximizes dispersal. Finally, we extend our approach to microorganisms moving along the surface. Our results provide a general framework to quantify dispersal that works across the vast diversity of movement patterns and porous media.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature structural study of smectic C$_A$* glass by X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid crystalline compound, forming the glass of the smectic C$_A$* phase, is investigated by the X-ray diffraction in the 18-298 K range. The characteristic distances within the smectic C$_A$* phase are determined. The electron density profile along the smectic layer normal is inferred and compared with the results of the density functional theory calculations. Observations of the selective reflection of the visible light investigate the helical ordering within the smectic C$_A$* glass. The results indicate slow evolution of the smectic layer spacing, intermolecular distances, and electron density distribution below the glass transition temperature. Meanwhile, the relative range of the short-range order within the smectic layers and the helix pitch are relatively constant in the glassy state.</description>

      <title>Polydispersity-driven dynamical differences between two- and three-dimensional supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have suggested a conundrum in the relaxation dynamics of polydisperse supercooled liquids. It has been shown that in two dimensions, the relative relaxation times of particles of different sizes become more similar as the material is cooled, whereas the opposite happens in three dimensions: they decouple. Here we resolve this conundrum. First, we show that the coupling observed in two dimensions is an artifact of cage correction introduced to account for Mermin-Wagner fluctuations. Instead, the relative relaxation time of small and large particles in two dimensions remains constant or slightly decouples with temperature, as opposed to the substantial decoupling observed in three dimensions. Investigating these dimensional differences further, we find through mobile cluster analysis that small particles initiate relaxation in both dimensions. As the clusters grow larger, they remain dominated by small particles in three dimensions whereas in two cluster growth becomes particle-size agnostic. We explain these findings with a minimal model by studying the distributions of single-particle barrier heights in the system, showing there is a clear difference in the environments of small and large particles, depending on the dimensionality. These findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in glass formation, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the glass transition in polydisperse supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of a Rouse polymer in a fluctuating correlated medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the static and dynamical properties of a harmonically confined Rouse polymer coupled to a fluctuating correlated medium, which affect each other reciprocally during their stochastic evolution. The medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field $\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$, which can feature modes with slow relaxation and long-range spatial correlations. We show that these modes affect the long-time behavior of the center-of-mass position of the polymer, which, after a displacement, turns out to relax algebraically towards its equilibrium position. In contrast, we show that the coupling to the medium speeds up the relaxation of higher Rouse modes. We further characterize the typical size of the polymer as a function of its polymerization degree and of the correlation length of the medium, in particular when the system is driven out of equilibrium via the application of a constant external driving force. Finally, we study the response of a linear polymer to a tensile force acting on its terminal monomers.</description>

      <title>Bacterial Turbulence in Shear Thinning Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective motion of bacteria, commonly referred to as bacterial turbulence, is well understood in Newtonian fluids. However, studies on complex fluids have predominantly focused on viscoelastic effects. In our experiments, we employed Ficoll and Methocel polymers to compare the impacts of Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids on bacterial turbulence. We reported various physical properties, including energy and enstrophy, and observed that the shear-thinning effect is significantly suppressed in high-concentration bacterial suspensions. This suppression is largely attributed to the disruption of chain-like polymer structures around bacterial flagella due to strong interbacterial interactions in dense suspensions. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted experiments across bacterial concentrations (within the range where bacterial turbulence forms) and verified the findings using theoretical calculations based on the modified Resistive Force Theory (RFT).</description>

      <title>The Roles of Size, Packing, and Cohesion in the Emergence of Force Chains in Granular Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates computationally the impact of particle size disparity and cohesion on force chain formation in granular media. The granular media considered in this study are bi-disperse systems under uniaxial compression, consisting of spherical, frictionless particles that interact through a modified Hookean model. Force chains in granular media are characterized as networks of particles that meet specific criteria for particle stress and inter-particle forces. The computational setup decouples the effects of particle packing on force chain formations, ensuring an independent assessment of particle size distribution and cohesion on force chain formation. The decoupling is achieved by characterizing particle packing through the radial density function, which enables the identification of systems with both regular and irregular packing. The fraction of particles in the force chains network is used to quantify the presence of the force chains.
  The findings show that particle size disparity promotes force chain formation in granular media with nearly-regular packing (i.e., an almost-ordered system). However, as particle size disparities grow, it promotes irregular packing (i.e., a disordered systems), leading to fewer force chains carrying larger loads than in ordered systems. Further, it is observed that the increased cohesion in granular systems leads to fewer force chains irrespective of particle size or packing.</description>

      <title>Ultra-stretchable and Self-Healable Vitrimers with Tuneable Damping and Mechanical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymer materials with unique properties offered by cross-links that can undergo associative exchange dynamics. We here present a new class of vitrimers based on poly(methyl acrylate) with cross-links utilising dioxaboralane metathesis. These vitrimers demonstrate a combination of ultra-stretchability (up to $\sim$ 80 times their own length), mechanical toughness ($\sim$ 40 MJ/m$^3$), and thermal stability up to $T\sim$ 250 {\deg}C; moreover, the vitrimers demonstrate excellent mechanical damping characterised by a loss factor ($\tan(\delta)$) with a maximum of $\sim$ 2-3 and an effective value $&gt;$0.3 across five decades in frequency (0.001-100 Hz), or correspondingly across a $T$-range of $\sim$ 35 {\deg}C near room temperature (for a probe frequency of 1 Hz). The vitrimers can be successfully re-processed using both a thermo-mechanical and a chemical processing route, and can self-heal at room temperature, making them suitable for sustainable applications. The material properties are directly tuneable by variation of both the amount of cross-linker and by the degree of curing. Thus, this class of vitrimers are promising for applications where stretchability combined with mechanical toughness and/or a high mechanical dissipation is required.</description>

      <title>Glassy Behavior and Anomalous Transport in Chimney Ladder Crystals Induced by Soft Optical Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3-\delta}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely soft optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the abundant soft optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that soft modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show spontaneous symmetry breaking wherein the liquid separates into two phases, each enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations of a geometrically similar model with a semi-empirical force field and no explicit bias towards homochiral interactions, in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds, captured by our force field, play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral fluid-phase separation. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</description>

      <title>Modelling of the dewetting of ultra-thin liquid films on chemically patterned substrates: linear spectrum and deposition patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid films of nanometric thickness are prone to spinodal dewetting driven by disjoining pressure, meaning that a non-wetting liquid film of homogeneous thickness in the range of tens of nanometers will spontaneously break into droplets. The surface energy of the underlying solid substrate heavily influences the dynamics and resulting droplet configurations. Here, we study the dewetting of thin liquid films on physically flat but chemically heterogeneous substrates using the thin film equation. We use linear stability analysis (LSA) to describe and predict the system's behavior until the film ruptures and compare it to numerical simulations. Based on our calculations, we propose a potential method for measuring surface energy patterns. Furthermore, we study the non-linear dynamics and the eventually formed droplet pattern by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A model for boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic triangular shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and discover that the hindgut deforms in two stages: an initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.</description>

      <title>Surface Tension Between Coexisting Phases of Active Brownian Particles</title>

Abstract: The confliction between the stable interface in phase-separated active Brownian particles and its negative surface tension, obtained mechanically via the active pressure, has sparked considerable debate about the formula of active surface tension. Based on the intrinsic pressure of active system, we here derive a new mechanical expression of active surface tension by calculating the work required to create a differential interface area, while remaining the interfacial profiles of intensive quantities invariant (not considered previously). Our expression yields a significantly positive surface tension that increases with the particle activity, which is further supported by mechanical stability analysis of both steady-state droplet and fluctuating interface. Our work is thus promising to resolve the contradiction related to active surface tension.</description>

      <title>Influence of Media Disorder on DNA Melting: A Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11030</link>

Abstract: We explore the melting of a lattice DNA in the presence of atmospheric disorder, which mimics the crowded environment inside the cell nucleus, using Monte Carlo simulations. The disorder is modeled by randomly retaining lattice sites with probability $p$ while diluting the rest, rendering them unavailable to the DNA. By varying the disorder over a wide range from $p=1$ (zero disorder) up to the percolation critical point $p_c=0.3116$, we show the melting temperature $(T_m)$ to increase nearly linearly with disorder up to $p\approx 0.6$, while strong non-linearity enters for $p\lesssim 0.6$. Associated changes in the bubble statistics have been investigated, showing a substantial change in the bubble size exponents at corresponding melting points for $p\leq 0.5$. Based on these findings two distinct disorder regimes showing weak and strong effects on melting are identified. For simulations, we use the pruned and enriched Rosenbluth method in conjunction with a depth-first implementation of the Leath algorithm to generate the underlying disorder.</description>

      <title>Surface tension-driven boundary growth in tumour spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03344</link>

Abstract: Growing experimental evidence highlights the relevant role of mechanics in the physiology of solid tumours, even in their early stages. While most of the mathematical models describe tumour growth as a volumetric increase of mass in the bulk, in vitro experiments on tumour spheroids have demonstrated that cell proliferation occurs in a thin layer at the boundary of the cellular aggregate. In this work, we investigate how elasticity and surface tension interact during the development of tumour spheroids. We model the spheroid as a hyperelastic material undergoing boundary accretion, where the newly created cells are deformed by the action of surface tension. This growth leads to a frustrated reference configuration, resulting in the appearance of residual stress. Our theoretical framework is validated using experimental results from the literature. Like fully developed tumours, spheroids open when subjected to radial cuts. Remarkably, this behaviour is observed even in newly formed spheroids, which lack residual stress. Through both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we show that this phenomenon is driven by elastocapillary interactions, where the residual stress developed in grown spheroids amplifies the tumour opening. Our model's outcomes align with experimental observations and allow us to estimate the surface tension acting on tumour spheroids.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03107</link>

Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.</description>
