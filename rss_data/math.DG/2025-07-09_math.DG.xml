      <title>The degree condition in Llarull's theorem on scalar curvature rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Llarull's scalar curvature rigidity theorem states that a 1-Lipschitz map $f: M\to S^n$ from a closed connected Riemannian spin manifold $M$ with scalar curvature $\mathrm{scal}\ge n(n-1)$ to the standard sphere $S^n$ is an isometry if the degree of $f$ is nonzero. We investigate if one can replace the condition $\mathrm{deg}(f)\neq0$ by the weaker condition that $f$ is surjective. The answer turns out to be "no" for $n\ge3$ but "yes" for $n=2$. If we replace the scalar curvature by Ricci curvature, the answer is "yes" in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of Sobolev spaces of differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the~study of embedding between different classes of Sobolev spaces of differential forms started in 2006 in a~paper by Gol'dshtein and Troyanov. As in this paper, our study is based on relations between $L_{q,p}$-cohomology and Sobolev type inequalities. The~main results are estimates for the norms of the embedding operators for $q=p$ and $p&gt;\frac{n-1}{k-1}$ in the~Euclidean $r$-ball $B(r)$ and its bi-Lipschitz images. The~compactness of such operators also studied.</description>

      <title>A new approach to the study of the manifold of fixed rank covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bures-Wasserstein geometry of covariance matrices stands at the crossroad of statistics, information geometry, quantum information and optimal transport. The space of covariance matrices admits stratified structure with strata consisting on fixed rank covariance matrices. In this paper we focus on the rank-$k$ stratum $\textrm{Sym}(n,k)$ and revisit its geometry through a new diffeomorphic model $\textrm{Sym}(n,k) \cong \textrm{St}(n,k) \times_{O(k)} \textrm{Sym}^{+}(k)$. Working in this bundle picture, we (i) prove that the fibers are totally geodesic, (ii) derive a system of differential equations for the Bures-wasserstein geodesics (iii) exhibit several examples of closed-form solutions, and (iv) prove a one-to-one correspondence between Grassmannian and $\textrm{Sym}(n,k)$ logarithms and hence minimizing geodesics. The alternative approach we propose, clarifies the role of the underlying base $\textrm{Gr}(k,n)$ and sets the stage for further investigations into low-rank covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>On the rigidity of manifolds with respect to Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rigidity properties concerning the Gagliardo-Nirenberg constants and the unweighted Yamabe-type constants. We establish that when $\alpha$ lies in a specific range around $1$, if an open subset $V \subset M$ satisfies $\int_{V} \lambda_1(\operatorname{Rc}) \, d\mu \geq 0$ and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg constants $\mathbb{G}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(V,g)$ are not less than those of the Euclidean space, then $V$ must be flat. Here, $\lambda_1(\operatorname{Rc})$ denotes the first eigenvalue of the Ricci tensor. Moreover, when $\alpha$ lies in a more restrictive range around $1$, if we replace the condition $\int_{V} \lambda_1(\operatorname{Rc}) \, d\mu \geq 0$ with the weaker condition $\int_{V} \operatorname{Sc} \, d\mu \geq 0$, we can still conclude that $V$ must be flat. We also show that when $\alpha$ is close to $1$, if an open subset $V \subset M$ satisfies the condition that its unweighted Yamabe-type constants $\mathbb{Y}_{\alpha}^{\pm}(V,g)$ are not less than those of the Euclidean space, then $V$ must be flat.</description>

      <title>Torsion parallel spinors on Lorentzian four-manifolds and supersymmetric evolution flows on bundle gerbes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation, parallel spinors on oriented and spin Lorentzian four-manifolds are investigated using the theory of spinorial polyforms. The main applications are directed towards the study of torsion parallel spinors and the globally hyperbolic solutions of the four-dimensional supersymmetric NS-NS system. This differential system, which originates in supergravity, involves torsion parallel spinors subject to a curvature condition and provides a natural gauge-theoretic interpretation of skew-symmetric torsion as the curvature of a curving on an abelian bundle gerbe, a natural categorification of the notion of principal circle bundle.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity of optimal transport maps on convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regularity of optimal transport maps between convex domains with quadratic cost. For nondegenerate $C^{\alpha}$-densities, we prove $C^{1, 1-\varepsilon}$-regularity of the potentials up to the boundary. If in addition the boundary is $C^{1, \alpha}$, we improve this to $C^{2, \alpha}$-regularity. We also investigate pointwise $C^{1, 1}$-regularity at boundary points. We obtain a complete characterization of pointwise $C^{1, 1}$-regularity for planar polytopes in terms of the geometry of tangent cones. Furthermore, we study the regularity of optimal transport maps with degenerate densities on cones, which arise from recent developments in K\"ahler geometry. The main new technical tool we introduce is a monotonicity formula for optimal transport maps on convex domains which characterizes the homogeneity of blow-ups.</description>

      <title>An adjunction inequality for Real embedded surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Real structure on a $4$-manifold $X$ is an orientation preserving smooth involution $\sigma$. We say that an embedded surface $\Sigma \subset X$ is Real if $\sigma$ maps $\Sigma$ to itself orientation reversingly. We prove that a cohomology class $u \in H^2(X ; \mathbb{Z})$ can be represented by a Real embedded surface if and only if $u$ can be lifted to a class in equivariant cohomology $H^2_{\mathbb{Z}_2}(X ; \mathbb{Z}_-)$. We prove that if the Real Seiberg--Witten invariants of $X$ are non-zero then the genus of Real embedded surfaces in $X$ satisfy an adjunction inequality. We prove two versions of the adjunction inequality, one for non-negative self-intersection and one for arbitrary self-intersection. We show with examples that the minimal genus of Real embedded surfaces can be larger than the minimal genus of arbitrary embedded surfaces.</description>

      <title>Torsors over moduli spaces of vector bundles over curves of fixed determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal M}$ be a moduli space of stable vector bundles of rank $r$ and determinant $\xi$ on a compact Riemann surface $X$. Fix a semistable holomorphic vector bundle $F$ on $X$ such that $\chi(E\otimes F)= 0$ for $E \in \mathcal M$. Then any $E\in \mathcal M$ with $H^0(X, E\otimes F) = 0 = H^1(X, E\otimes F)$ has a natural holomorphic projective connection. The moduli space of pairs $(E,\, \nabla)$, where $E\, \in\, \mathcal M$ and $\nabla$ is a holomorphic projective connection on $E$, is an algebraic $T^*{\mathcal M}$--torsor on $\mathcal M$. We identify this $T^*{\mathcal M}$--torsor on $\mathcal M$ with the $T^*{\mathcal M}$--torsor given by the sheaf of connections on an ample line bundle over $\mathcal M$.</description>

      <title>The Einstein-Hilbert action for perturbed second-order spectral triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [6], the higher-order spectral triple and its relative K-homology were studied. Motivated by the Kastler-Kalau-Walze theorem, we propose an extension of the Einstein-Hilbert action to the framework of higher-order spectral triples. To illustrate this construction, we introduce two second-order spectral triples and explicitly compute their respective Einstein-Hilbert action, demonstrating the applicability of our theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic supergravity in ten dimensions and anomaly cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a ten-dimensional version of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau five-fold that reproduces the classical Maurer-Cartan equation governing supersymmetric heterotic moduli. Quantising this theory's quadratic fluctuations, we show that its one-loop partition function simplifies to products of holomorphic Ray-Singer torsions and exhibits an anomaly that factorises as in $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ supergravity. Based on this, we conjecture that this theory is the $SU(5)$-twisted version of ten-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity coupled to Yang-Mills and show that is related to the type I Kodaira-Spencer theory of Costello-Li via a non-local field redefinition. The counter-terms needed to cancel the anomaly and retain gauge invariance for the one-loop effective theory reconstruct the differential of a recently discovered double-extension complex. This complex has non-tensorial extension classes and its first cohomology counts the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic compactifications modulo order $\alpha'^2$ corrections.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of spin connections on three-dimensional homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we aim to classify and characterize the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections and homogeneous $SU(2)$ connections on three-dimensional Riemannian homogeneous spaces. An analysis of the topology of the associated moduli spaces reveals that they are finite-dimensional topological manifolds (possibly with boundary) possessing trivial homotopy groups.
  Owing to their deep connection with cosmological models in the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity, this study offers a mathematically rigorous interpretation of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection within a cosmological context. In particular, we show that a correct formulation of the theory relies crucially on identifying the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections, thereby emphasizing the essential role of the spin structure in ensuring consistency with the physical content of the theory.
  The favorable topological properties of these moduli spaces circumvent many of the usual difficulties associated with singularities and the definition of regular measures in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. As a result, they provide a solid foundation for the rigorous implementation of quantum theory in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the obstacle problem associated to mean curvature flow. We add to the geometric vanishing-viscosity approximation of Evans and Spruck a singular perturbation that penalizes the violation of the constraint, and pass to the limit. The resulting level set formulation has unique solutions - up to fattening. Extending the work of Evans and Spruck and a work by Ullrich and one of the authors, we show that generic level sets of this flow are distributional solutions of the obstacle problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a novel uniformization metric model for the quasi-Fuchsian space QF(S) of a closed oriented surface S, defined through a class of C-valued bilinear forms on S, called Bers metrics, which coincide with hyperbolic Riemannian metrics along the Fuchsian locus. By employing this approach, we present a new model of the holomorphic tangent bundle of QF(S) that extends the metric model for Teichm\"uller space defined by Berger and Ebin, and give an integral representation of the Goldman symplectic form and of the holomorphic extension of the Weil-Petersson metric to QF(S), with a new proof of its existence and non-degeneracy. We also determine new bounds for the Schwarzian of Bers projective structures extending Kraus estimate. Lastly, we use this formalism to give alternative proofs to several classic results in quasi-Fuchsian theory.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow of Callias operators, odd K-cowaist, and positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a complete Riemannian manifold $M$, we study the spectral flow of a family of Callias operators. We derive a codimension zero formula when the dimension of $M$ is odd and a codimension one formula when the dimension of $M$ is even. These can be seen as analogues of Gromov--Lawson's relative index theorem and classical Callias index theorem, respectively. Secondly, we introduce an intrinsic definition of K-cowaist on odd-dimensional manifolds, making use of the odd Chern character of a smooth map from the manifold to a unitary group. It behaves just like the usual K-cowaist on even-dimensional manifolds. We then apply the notion of odd K-cowaist and the tool of spectral flow to investigate problems related to positive scalar curvature on spin manifolds. In particular, we prove infinite odd K-cowaist to be an obstruction to the existence of PSC metrics. We obtain quantitative scalar curvature estimates on complete non-compact manifolds and scalar-mean curvature estimates on compact manifolds with boundary. They extend several previous results optimally, which unfolds a major advantage of our method via spectral flow and odd K-cowaist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two Liouville-type theorems for capillary minimal graph over $\mathbb{R}^n_+$. First, if $u$ has linear growth, then for $n=2,3$ and for any $\theta\in(0,\pi)$, or $n\geq4$ and $\theta\in(\frac{\pi}6,\frac{5\pi}6)$, $u$ must be flat. Second, if $u$ is one-sided bounded on $\mathbb{R}^n_+$, then for any $n$ and $\theta\in(0,\pi)$, $u$ must be flat. The proofs build upon gradient estimates for the mean curvature equation over $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ with capillary boundary condition, which are based on carefully adapting the maximum principle to the capillary setting.</description>

      <title>Classification of Horikawa surfaces with T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify all projective surfaces with only T-singularities, ample canonical class, and $K^2=2p_g-4$. In this way, we identify all surfaces, smoothable or not, with only T-singularities in the Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of Horikawa surfaces. We also prove that they are not smoothable when $p_g \geq 10$, except for the Lee-Park (Fintushel-Stern) examples, which we show to have only one deformation type unless $p_g=6$ (in which case they have two). This demonstrates that the challenging Horikawa problem cannot be addressed through complex T-degenerations. We propose new questions regarding diffeomorphism types based on our classification. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper enable us to classify all KSBA surfaces with only T-singularities and $K^2\leq 2p_g-3$, for example, quintic surfaces and I-surfaces.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic dependence for the Beltrami equation in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a path of Beltrami differentials on $\mathbb C$ that live in and vary holomorphically in the Sobolev space $W^{l,\infty}_{loc}(\Omega)$ of an open subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb C$, the canonical solutions to the Beltrami equation vary holomorphically in $W^{l+1,p}_{loc}(\Omega)$ for admissible $p &gt; 2$. This extends a foundational result of Ahlfors and Bers (the case $l = 0$). As an application, we deduce that Bers metrics on surfaces depend holomorphically on their input data.</description>

      <title>New Lie systems from Goursat distributions: reductions and reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that types of bracket-generating distributions lead to new classes of Lie systems with compatible geometric structures. Specifically, the $n$-trailer system is analysed, showing that its associated distribution is related to a Lie system if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. These systems allow symmetry reductions and the reconstruction of solutions of the original system from those of the reduced one. The reconstruction procedure is discussed and indicates potential extensions for studying broader classes of differential equations through Lie systems and new types of superposition rules.</description>

      <title>Proper Actions and Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This exposition presents recent developments on proper actions, highlighting their connections to representation theory. It begins with geometric aspects, including criteria for the properness of homogeneous spaces in the setting of reductive groups. We then explore the interplay between the properness of group actions and the discrete decomposability of unitary representations realized on function spaces. Furthermore, two contrasting new approaches to quantifying proper actions are examined:
  one based on the notion of sharpness, which measures how strongly a given action satisfies properness;
  and another based on dynamical volume estimates, which measure deviations from properness. The latter quantitative estimates have proven especially fruitful in establishing temperedness criterion for regular unitary representations on $G$-spaces.
  Throughout, key concepts are illustrated with concrete geometric and representation-theoretic examples.</description>
