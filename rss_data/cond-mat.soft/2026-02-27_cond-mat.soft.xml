      <title>Field-induced phase transitions in ferro-antiferromagnetic diblock copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium properties of a model of magnetic diblock copolymer where each monomer is decorated with an Ising-like spin. Spins interact ferromagnetically within each block and antiferromagnetically across blocks, generating frustration between magnetic ordering and spatial organization. By employing a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations for self-avoiding walks on the cubic lattice, we investigate the system's response to an external magnetic field. We discover a rich phase diagram that includes: a swollen phase with both filaments magnetically disordered and spatially extended; a mixed compact phase characterized by a single globule in which the two filaments are strongly intertwined; a segregated compact phase composed of two globular, magnetically ordered, and spatially separated blocks. Further, if the magnitude of the intra-block ferromagnetic interaction differs between the two blocks, we observe a hybrid segregated (``tadpole'') phase where one extended block coexists with a collapsed one. Mean-field predictions are in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo results for the location of the phase boundaries. These findings provide a minimal statistical-mechanical framework for field-controlled self-assembly of tunable patterns by magnetically heterogeneous polymers. They may also serve as a simple platform to investigate the coupling between internal epigenetic-like states and chromatin folding.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Liquid Crystal Directrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems often operate at the boundary between order and chaos, transitioning from directed to irregular dynamics to achieve adaptability and robustness. Reproducing such transitions in artificial soft matter remains a central challenge. Here, we report a biomimetic regime of directron dynamics in achiral nematic liquid crystals, in which coherent, directed motion collectively evolves into chaos. Driven by multi-directron interactions, the system develops coexisting directron families with competing trajectories, displaying randomized motion, dynamic assembly formation and spontaneous fission of high energy to low energy daughter directrons - all of which mimics the phenotypic diversity observed in biological groups. Above a critical electric field, these interactions drive the system into a chaotic state that is distinct from the directed behaviours reported previously. We further introduce a minimal dipole-based model that qualitatively captures the underlying physics of this transition. Together, our results establish an artificial active system in which chaos emerges intrinsically from interactions, offering a versatile platform to study biological dynamics and opening new avenues for liquid-crystal-based soft-matter applications involving adaptive transport, cargo delivery, and energy transduction</description>

      <title>Non-linear visco-elasto-plastic rheology of a viscous vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphogenesis involves complex shape changes of biological tissues. Yet, tissue shape changes depend on tissue rheology, which in turn arises from the interplay of large numbers of cells. Here, we link cell- and tissue-scale mechanics by constructing mean-field rheological relations for the vertex model. In contrast to past work in the field, we study a vertex model with an explicit viscous friction. We also include two different cellular mechanisms creating active, anisotropic stresses. Our mean-field model accounts for cell shape and the non-linear elastic and visco-plastic regimes. We validate our results by predicting the response to large-amplitude oscillatory shear. There are several vertex model variants, and comparing to results from the literature, we show that their rheology depends on a number of model details. Our approach should be sufficiently general to construct non-linear mean-field constitutive relations for any cell-based tissue model.</description>

      <title>Exact Rheology of Uniform Shear Flow in a Gas of Inelastic and Rough Maxwell Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady uniform shear flow of a granular gas composed of inelastic and rough Maxwell particles. Exploiting the mean-field character of the model, we derive exact expressions for the collisional production rates of the second-degree moments and obtain a closed nonlinear solution for the stress and spin-spin tensors. The rotational-to-translational temperature ratio and the proportionality between the spin-spin and stress tensors are shown to be independent of the coefficient of normal restitution and determined solely by roughness and moment of inertia. The reduced normal stresses, shear stress, and shear rate are obtained explicitly in terms of two effective parameters generalizing the cooling and stress relaxation rates of the smooth model. From these results we derive exact expressions for the non-Newtonian shear viscosity, the first viscometric function, and the friction coefficient. The dependence of the rheological properties on the normal and tangential restitution coefficients is analyzed in detail, revealing strong non-Newtonian behavior and nonmonotonic effects of roughness. The results reduce, in the appropriate limits, to those of the inelastic Maxwell model for smooth particles and to the Pidduck gas in the elastic perfectly rough case.</description>

      <title>Coupling between Phase Separation and Geometry on a Closed Elastic Curve: Free Energy Minimization and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the free energy and dynamics of a closed elastic filament (a one-dimensional curve in two dimensions) whose local internal state is specified by curvature, stretch, and a scalar density field representing, for example, the concentration of an absorbed species. The density variable has a tendency to phase-separate whereas the local spontaneous curvature is concentration-dependent. There is also a coupling between concentration and the stretching of the filament, although our main interest is in the nearly inextensible regime. We formulate and simulate the dynamics, comprising a coupled Willmore flow and Cahn-Hilliard gradient flow on the full differential geometry of a closed filament, addressing issues that previous work typically sidestepped by restricting to the Monge gauge. We use a numerical strategy for global free energy minimization, presenting the equilibrium shapes and density profiles across a wide range of model parameters. The phase diagram is dominated by a relatively small number of simple shapes that exhibit, as expected, strong coupling between local curvature and concentration. We also find regimes where curvature and/or stretching energies suppress phase separation altogether. For selected parameter values we present fully dynamical results, tracking the time evolution of the various contributions to the free energy. The dynamics often arrive at metastable minima rather than the equilibrium state - for example, at states with more than the minimum number of interfaces between coexisting phases. The metastability of these states is absent for phase separation on a rigid circular domain and thus a direct result of the coupling between geometry and density.</description>

      <title>Depth-dependent interplay of dynamical heterogeneity and chain dynamics at the surface of glass-forming polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer thin films exhibit pronounced interfacial mobility gradients that modify chain relaxation, yet how these gradients govern chain-scale dynamics across depth remains incompletely understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations of freestanding glass-forming polymer films, we resolve how depth-dependent variations in segmental relaxation shape chain dynamics across a wide range of displacement scales. Near the free surface, accelerated segmental mobility suppresses Rouse-regime scaling exponents to values as low as gamma = 0.4, reflecting transient localization induced by interfacial mobility gradients rather than topological entanglement. In contrast, the film interior exhibits enhanced Rouse scaling exponents consistent with predictions of the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), indicating that bulk dynamic heterogeneity compresses the Rouse regime. Mapping the minimum scaling exponent gamma_min across depth reveals a linear gradient that separates the bulk-like enhancement regime from the surface-induced suppression regime of chain dynamical scaling. Together, these results demonstrate that bulk and interfacial dynamic heterogeneity modify chain relaxation in opposite ways and establish Rouse scaling as a sensitive, spatially resolved probe of glassy dynamical heterogeneity and interfacial dynamical gradients in polymers.</description>

      <title>Rheological properties and shear-induced structures of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals are fluids with a polar orientational order. The electric polarization vector can be aligned by an electric field and by surface anchoring. Here, we explore how the polarization field and effective viscosity of the NF materials are affected by shear flows. We explore three NF materials, abbreviated RM734, DIO, and a room-temperature FNLC919, all of which exhibit a paraelectric nematic (N) and the NF phase. All materials show an increase of the viscosity upon cooling, with an Arrhenius behavior. In DIO and FNLC919, the antiferroelectric SmZA phase shows a strong dependence of the effective viscosity on the shear rate: this viscosity is lower than the viscosity of the N and NF phases at high shear rates but is much higher when the shear rate is low. The behavior is associated with the layered structure of the SmZA phase. All mesophases exhibit shear-thinning behavior at low shear rates and a nearly Newtonian behavior at higher shear rates. In terms of alignment, we observe three regimes in the N and NF phases: flow-alignment at low shear rates, log-rolling regime with the director and polarization along the vorticity axis at high shear rates, and polydomain structures at intermediate rates. In the flow-aligning regime, the NF polarization does not tilt away from the shear direction, which is in sharp contrast to the flow-induced tilt of the N director. The effect is attributed to the avoidance of splay deformations and associated space charge in the flowing NF. The temperature and shear rate dependencies of the viscosity and the uncovered shear-induced structural effects of NF advance our understanding of these materials and potentially facilitate their applications.</description>

      <title>Persistence-Driven Void Formation in Active-Passive Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that dilute active dopants can melt an arrested amorphous solid by enhancing cage breaking and accelerating structural relaxation. Yet it remains unclear whether increasing persistence simply amplifies this effective melting or instead reorganizes the fluidization mechanism itself. Here we show that, in a minimal active-passive mixture, increasing persistence drives a crossover from homogeneous fluidization to a localized mechanical instability, demonstrating that sustained active forcing restructures relaxation in space rather than merely strengthening it. Persistent dopants accumulate stress and nucleate voids as their mechanically perturbed regions overlap. In this regime, rearrangements localize at void boundaries, and active and passive particles exhibit comparable mobility, producing dynamics reminiscent of crowd mosh pits. Persistence therefore reorganizes fluidization through stress accumulation and confinement, revealing a distinct nonequilibrium localization mechanism in disordered solids.</description>

      <title>An Information-theoretic Collective Variable for Configurational Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy governs molecular self-assembly, phase transitions, and material stability, yet remains challenging to quantify and directly control in molecular systems. Here, we demonstrate that the computable information density (CID), a data compression-based information theoretic metric, provides an instantaneous general measure of configurational entropy in molecular dynamics simulations, reflecting both local and long-range structural organization. We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions. By establishing entropy as a directly accessible structural metric, this framework lays a foundation for future entropy-driven materials design and optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</description>

      <title>Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Flow birefringence measurement in a radial Hele-Shaw cell considering three-dimensional effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow. In the radial Hele-Shaw flow, stress is dominant along the gap direction, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL) with measurement from the gap direction. To overcome this problem, we used two types of flow birefringence measurement using radial Hele-Shaw cell and rheometer. We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction. The stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL was obtained by rheo-optical measurements. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</description>
