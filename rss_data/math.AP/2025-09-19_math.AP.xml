      <title>Linear non-divergence elliptic equations in a bounded, infinitely winding planar domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the second order elliptic equations of non-divergence form in a planar domain with complicated geometry. In this case the domain winds around a fixed circle infinitely many times and converges to it when the rotating angle goes to infinity. For the homogeneous equation and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, in the case of bounded drifts, we prove that the maximum of the solution on the cross-section corresponding to a given rotating angle either grows or decays exponentially as the angle goes to infinity. Results for the oscillation and its asymptotic estimates are also obtained for inhomogeneous Dirichlet data. If the drift is unbounded but does not grow to infinity too fast, then the above maximum also goes to either zero or infinity. For the inhomogeneous equation, we obtain the estimates in the case of bounded forcing functions. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of the solution and its continuous dependence on the boundary data and the forcing function.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions for a class of stochastic thermo-magneto-hydrodynamic-type systems with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, in the sense of PDEs and probability, for a broad class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on a bounded domain $\mathscr{O}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\leq 3$), perturbed by spatially correlated multiplicative noise. Our framework applies to many physically relevant systems, including stochastic convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations, stochastic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), stochastic B\'enard convection in porous media, stochastic convective dynamo models, and stochastic magneto-micropolar fluids, among others. The analysis relies on Galerkin approximations and compactness arguments. Up to a suitable stopping time, we derive strong moment bounds and verify a Cauchy property for the approximate solutions, in the absence of any inherent cancellation structure. By applying a Gronwall-type lemma for stochastic processes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of maximal strong pathwise solutions, which are global in two spatial dimensions. These results provide a unified treatment of a wide class of nonlinear stochastic thermo-magneto-fluid models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Existence, asymptotic behaviors, and high-dimensional uniqueness of topological solutions to the skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the topological solutions to the skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs: $$\left\{\begin{aligned} \Delta u &amp;=\lambda\mathrm{e}^{\upsilon}(\mathrm{e}^{u}-1)+4\pi\sum\limits_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j\delta_{p_j}, \Delta \upsilon&amp;=\lambda\mathrm{e}^{u}(\mathrm{e}^{\upsilon}-1)+4\pi\sum\limits_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j\delta_{q_j}, \end{aligned} \right. $$ here, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}_+$, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are two positive integers, $m_j\in\mathbb{N}\, (j=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot,k_1)$, $n_j\in\mathbb{N}\,(j=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot,k_2)$, and $\delta_{p}$ denotes the Dirac mass at vertex $p$. Write $$g=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j\delta_{p_j},\ h=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j\delta_{q_j},\ B = 4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j + 4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j.$$ For any fixed $g,h$, we prove the existence of the topological solutions to the systems, then obtain the asymptotic behaviors of topological solutions as $\lambda \rightarrow 0_+$ and $\lambda \rightarrow +\infty$, and finally prove the uniqueness of the topological solutions when the dimension of lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is large enough or $\lambda$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>Discretization and Vanishing Discount Problems for First-order Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses two issues related to the first-order discounted mean field games system. The first is the time discretization problem. The time discretization approach enables us to prove the existence of solutions (u,m) of the system, where u is a viscosity solution of the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation and m is a projected minimizing measure satisfying the continuity equation in the sense of distributions. The second is the vanishing discount problems for both the discounted mean field games system and its discretized system. The methods we use primarily derive from weak KAM theory. Moreover, we provide an example demonstrating the non-uniqueness of solutions to the discounted mean field games system.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity properties of the Robin torsion function in a class of symmetric planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the monotonicity property of the Robin torsion function in a smooth planar domain $\Omega$ with a line of symmetry, provided that the Robin coefficient $\beta$ is greater than or equal to the negative of the boundary curvature $\kappa$ (i.e., $\beta \geq -\kappa$ on $\partial\Omega$). We also show that this condition is, in a certain sense, sharp by constructing a counterexample.</description>

      <title>Normalized solution for Kirchhoff equation with upper critical exponent and mixed Choquard type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of normalized solution to the following Kirchhoff equation with mixed Choquard type nonlinearities: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\left(a + b \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2 \, dx\right) \Delta u - \lambda u = \mu |u|^{q-2} u + (I_\alpha * |u|^{\alpha + 3}) |u|^{\alpha +1} u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^3, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u^2 \, dx = \rho^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $a,b,\rho &gt;0$, $\alpha \in \left(0, 3\right)$, $\frac{14}{3} &lt; q &lt; 6$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ will arise as a Lagrange multiplier. The quantity $\alpha + 3$ here represents the upper critical exponent relevant to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, and this exponent can be regarded as equivalent to the Sobolev critical exponent $2^*$. We generalize the results by Wang et al.(Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems, 2025), which focused on nonlinear Kirchhoff equations with combined nonlinearities when $2&lt; q&lt; \frac{10}{3}$. The primary challenge lies in the necessity for subtle energy estimates under the \(L^2\)-constraint to achieve compactness recovery. Meanwhile, we need to deal with the difficulties created by the two nonlocal terms appearing in the equation.</description>

      <title>Blow up results and lifespan estimates for nonlinear damped wave equations on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in studying the Cauchy problems for nonlinear damped wave equations and their systems on a weighted graph. Our main purpose is two-fold, namely, under certain conditions for volume growth of a ball and the initial data we would like to not only prove nonexistence of global (in time) weak solutions but also indicate lifespan estimates for local (in time) weak solutions when a blow-up phenomenon in finite time occurs. Throughout the present paper, we will partially give a positive answer for the optimality of our results by an application to the $n$-dimensional integer lattice graph $\Z^n$ to recover the well-known results in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an existence result for solutions to a class of nonlinear degenerate-elliptic equations with measurable coefficients and zero Dirichlet boundary condition. The main term is given by a nonlinear operator in divergence form associated to a family of vector fields which satisfy a Poincar\'e inequality and the doubling condition.
  Furthermore, we prove that the solutions satisfy a generalization of the $L^p$-regularity results which hold for the solutions to Leray-Lions type equations.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Boltzmann and Landau Equations in Critical Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous Boltzmann and Landau equations in critical function spaces, a fundamental open problem in kinetic theory. We develop a new analytical framework to establish local well-posedness near a global Maxwellian for both equations, under the assumption that the initial perturbation is small in a critical norm. A major contribution lies in the introduction of a novel anisotropic norm adapted to the intrinsic scaling invariance of the equations, which provides precise control over the high-frequency behavior of solutions. By leveraging the regularizing effect and a decomposition of the linearized collision operator, we further extend the local solution globally in time and establish pointwise decay estimates. Our work not only resolves a fundamental issue in the theory of kinetic equations in critical spaces, but also provides a new approach applicable to a broader class of kinetic models.</description>

      <title>Invariant Gibbs dynamics for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on the unit disc in the plane with the Gibbs initial data under radial symmetry. By using a type of random averaging operator ansatz, we build a strong local-in-time solution theory, and thus prove almost sure global well-posedness and invariance of the Gibbs measure via Bourgain's invariant measure argument. This work completes the program initiated by Tzvetkov (2006, 2008) on the construction of invariant Gibbs dynamics (of strong solutions) for NLS on the disc.</description>

      <title>A monotonicity formula for the fractional Laplacian and instability results for the Shrira equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing a new class of pseudo-differential operators introduced in a previous work, we establish a novel monotonicity formula for the fractional Laplacian $|\nabla_x|^\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n \geq 2$ and $\alpha \in [1,2)$, This framework enables us to localize our analysis to specific regions of Euclidean space where monotonicity properties of the $L^2$-mass of solutions to dispersive equations with fractional dispersion are preserved.
  As an application, we focus on the Shrira equation, proving conditional instability results for its traveling wave solutions in the critical regime. We deduce key virial-type estimates that govern the long-time behavior of the $L^2$-mass. As a consequence, we establish instability results without requiring pointwise decay estimates employed in previous works. Our approach provides a robust and flexible method for monotonicity techniques to higher dimensions, shedding light on the delicate interplay between nonlocal dispersion and spatial localization in nonlinear dispersive models.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian controllability in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question at stake in Lagrangian controllability is whether one can move a patch of fluid particles to a target location by means of remote action in a given time interval. In the last two decades, positive results have been obtained both for the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. However, for the latter, the case where the fluid is contained within domains bounded by solid boundaries with the no-slip condition has not been addressed, with respect to the difficulty caused by viscous boundary layers. In this paper, we investigate the Lagrangian controllability of viscous incompressible fluid in perforated domains for which the fraction of volume occupied by the holes is sufficiently small. Moreover, we quantitatively distinguish situations depending on the parameters for holes (diameter and distance) and for fluid (size of the initial data). Our approach relies on recent results on homogenization for evolutionary problems and on weak-strong stability estimates in measure of flows, alongside classical results on Runge-type approximations for elliptic equations and on Cauchy-Kowalevsky-type theorems for equations with analytic coefficients. Here, homogenization refers to the vanishing viscosity limit outside a porous medium, where (after scaling in time) the Navier-Stokes equations are homogenized to the Euler or Darcy equations.</description>

      <title>Recovering elastic subdomains with strain-gradient elastic interfaces from force measurements: the antiplane shear setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new inverse problem for antiplane shear in elastic bodies with strain-gradient interfaces. The setting is a homogeneous isotropic elastic body containing an inclusion separated by a thin interface endowed with higher-order surface energy. Using displacement-stress measurements on the exterior boundary, expressed through a certain Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, we show uniqueness in recovering both the shear and interface parameters, as well as the shape of the inclusion. To address the inverse shape problem, we adapt the factorization method to account for the complications introduced by the higher-order boundary operator and its nontrivial null space. Numerical experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach, indicating that the framework potentially provides a practical tool for nondestructive detection of interior inhomogeneities, including damaged subvolumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present a well-known connection between the Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces, also known as Fractional Sobolev spaces, and interpolation theory. We show how Sobolev spaces can be equivalently characterized as real and complex interpolation spaces between Lebesgue spaces and integer-order Sobolev spaces. We also state a spectral theorem for the so-called mixed local-nonlocal operators, and show how interpolation theory leads to its proof. This note is intended for early-career researchers, and aims to provide a concise and accessible introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fundamental Gap Estimate on Convex Domains of Gaussian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp lower bound for the fundamental gap of convex domains in Gaussian space, the difference between the first two eigenvalues of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main result establishes that the gap is bounded below by the gap of a corresponding one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator, confirming the Gaussian analogue of the fundamental gap conjecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalized gap of the one dimensional model is monotonically increasing with the diameter and prove the sharpness of our estimate. This work extends the seminal results of Andrews and Clutterbuck for Euclidean domains and Seto, Wang and Wei for spherical domains to the fundamentally important setting of Gaussian spaces.</description>

      <title>Universality of SIS epidemics starting from small initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are investigating deterministic SIS dynamics on large networks starting from only a few infected individuals. Under mild assumptions we show that any two epidemic curves - on the same network and with the same parameters - are almost identical up to time translation when initial conditions are small enough regardless of how infections are distributed at the beginning. The limit object - an epidemic starting from the infinite past with infinitesimal prevalence - is identified as the nontrivial eternal solution connecting the disease free state with the endemic equilibrium. Our framework covers several benchmark models including the N-Intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA) and the Inhomogeneous Mean Field Approximation (IMFA).</description>

Abstract: We consider controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with measurable coefficients, a uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficient and an $L_d$-drift. No space-regularity will be assumed for the coefficients. In this framework we investigate the relation of value functions, partial differential equations (PDEs) and operator semigroups. First, for a cost with infinite time horizon on a bounded domain, we identify the value function as $L_{d_0}$-viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and we establish quantitative regularity estimates. The constant $d_0 \in (d/2, d)$ only depends on the space dimension $d$, the ellipticity constants of the diffusion coefficient and the $L_d$-bound of the drift. To illustrate applications of these results, we provide a uniqueness theorem under an additional assumption on the diffusion coefficient, showing a stochastic representation, and we discuss stability of value functions. Second, we consider a cost with a finite time horizon, terminal and running terms. We show that the value function indexed over the terminal cost is a nonlinear semigroup on $C_b (\mathbb{R}^d)$ and we establish a regularization by noise effect, which shows that the semigroup regularizes lower semicontinuity to local H\"older continuity. Lastly, we relate the semigroup to a parabolic PDE, showing that it is an $L_{d + 1}$-viscosity solution, and we establish local in time and global in space quantitative regularity estimates. Our proofs for the regularity of the value functions, the $C_b$-Feller property of the semigroup and its regularization by noise effects are based on a strong Markov selection principle and analytic estimates for linear diffusions that were recently established by N. V. Krylov in a series of papers. We highlight that our method covers frameworks without uniqueness of the controlled SDEs, as well as the associated PDEs.</description>

      <title>The isoperimetric inequality for the capillary energy outside convex cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces with a general contact angle $\theta \in (0, \pi)$, outside convex infinite cylinders with arbitrary two-dimensional convex section. We prove that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex cylinder is strictly larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact angle on a flat support, unless the surface is itself a spherical cap resting on a facet of the cylinder. In this class of convex sets, our result extends for the first time the well-known Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e relative isoperimetric inequality, corresponding to the case $\theta = \pi/2$, to general angles.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bound states with prescribed angular momentum in the mass supercritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in \cite{NSS}, where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of half-harmonic map heat flows for rough initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt the Koch-Tataru theory for the Navier-Stokes equations, based on Carleson measure estimates, to develop a scaling-critical low-regularity framework for half-harmonic map heat flows. This nonlocal variant of the harmonic map heat flow has been studied recently in connection with free boundary minimal surfaces. We introduce a new class of initial data for the flow, broader than the conventional energy or Sobolev spaces considered in previous work, for which we establish existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence. The class particularly includes homogeneous initial data that give rise to self-similar expanders.</description>

      <title>Quantum ergodicity for contact metric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the proof of a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of subLaplacians on contact metric manifolds, under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. To do so, we rely on a semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus developed for general filtered manifolds that we specialize to the setting of contact manifolds. Our strategy is then reminiscent of an implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as we rely on the construction of microlocal projectors in our calculus which commute with the subLaplacian, called Landau projectors. The subLaplacian is then shown to act effectively on the range of each Landau projector as the Reeb vector field does. The remainder of the proof follows the classical path towards QE, once microlocal Weyl laws have been established.</description>

      <title>Solutions to conservation laws are H\"older-stable in $L^2$ in the weak-BV setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one spatial dimension. For any limit of front tracking solutions $v$, and for a general weak solution $u\in L^\infty$ with no BV assumption, we prove the following H\"older-type stability estimate in $L^2$:
  $$||u(\cdot,\tau)-v(\cdot,\tau)||_{L^2} \leq K \sqrt{||u( \cdot,0)-v( \cdot,0)||_{L^2}}$$
  for all $\tau$ without smallness and for a universal constant $K$. Our result holds for all limits of front tracking solutions $v$ with BV bound, either for general systems with small-BV data, or for special systems (isothermal Euler, Temple-class systems) with large-BV data. Our results apply to physical systems such as isentropic Euler. The stability estimate is completely independent of the BV norm of the potentially very wild solution $u$. We use the $L^2$ theory of shock stability modulo an artificial shift of position (Vasseur [Handbook of Differential Equations: Evolutionary Equations, 4:323 -- 376, 2008]) but our stability results do not depend on an artificial shift. Moreover, we give the first result within this framework which can show uniqueness of some solutions with large $L^\infty$ and infinite BV initial data. We apply these techniques to isothermal Euler.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov estimates for polynomial operators by determinant majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain estimates on the supremum, infimum and oscillation of solutions for a wide class of inhomogeneous fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Euclidean domains where the differential operator is an I-central Garding-Dirichlet operator in the sense of Harvey-Lawson (2024). The argument combines two recent results: an Alexandrov estimate of Payne-Redaelli (2025) for locally semiconvex functions based on the area formula and a determinant majorization estimate of Harvey-Lawson (2024).
  The determinant majorization estimate has as a special case the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality, so the result includes the classical Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate for linear operators. A potential theoretic approach is used involving subequation subharmonics and their dual subharmonics. Semiconvex approximation plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Entire Large Solutions for Competitive Semilinear Elliptic Systems with General Nonlinearities Satisfying Keller--Osserman Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a theorem of Lair concerning the existence of positive entire large solutions to competitive semilinear elliptic systems. While Lair's original result \cite{Lair2025} was established for power-type nonlinearities, our work extends the theory to a broad class of general nonlinearities satisfying a Keller--Osserman-type growth condition. The proof follows the same conceptual framework monotone iteration to construct global positive solutions, reduction to a scalar inequality for the sum of the components, application of a Keller--Osserman transform, and a two-step radial integration argument but replaces the explicit power-law growth with a general monotone envelope function. This approach yields a unified and verifiable criterion for the existence of large solutions in terms of the Keller--Osserman integral, thereby encompassing both critical and supercritical growth regimes within a single analytical setting.</description>

      <title>Rough Burger-like SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By applying the theory of rough paths, Martin Hairer provided a notion of solution for a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of Burgers type, driven by additive space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. These equations exhibit spatial roughness that is too severe for classical analytical techniques to handle. Hairer developed a pathwise framework for solutions when the spatial regularity of the solution lies in the range $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$. In this paper, we generalize Hairer's result by extending the spatial regularity to the range $(0, 1]$. More precisely, we establish the pathwise existence and uniqueness of mild (and, equivalently, weak) solutions to Burgers-type SPDEs under this spatial regularity regime.</description>

Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation on a strictly pseudo-convex domain in Cn or a Hermitian manifold.
