      <title>Some contributions to sheaf model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper makes contributions to "pure" sheaf model theory, the part of model theory in which the models are sheaves over a complete Heyting algebra. We start by outlining the theory in a way we hope is readable for the non-specialist. We then give a careful treatment of the interpretation of terms and formulae. This allows us to prove various preservation results, including strengthenings of the results of Brunner and Miraglia. We give refinements of Miraglia's work on directed colimits and an analogue of Tarski's theorem on the preservation of $\forall_2$-sentences under unions of chains. We next show various categories whose objects are (pairs of) presheaves and sheaves with various notions of morphism are accessible in the category theoretic sense. Together these ingredients allow us ultimately to prove that these categories are encompassed in the AECats framework for independence relations developed by Kamsma.</description>

      <title>The submonoid and rational subset membership problems for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the submonoid membership problem and the rational subset membership problem are equivalent in Artin groups. Both these problem are undecidable in a given Artin group if and only if the group embeds the right-angled Artin groups of rank 4 over a path or a square; and this can be characterized using only the defining graph of the Artin group. These results generalize the ones by Lohrey - Steinberg for right-angled Artin groups. Moreover, both these decision problems are decidable for a given Artin group if and only if the group is subgroup separable. This equivalence for right-angled Artin groups is provided by Lohrey - Steinberg and Metaftsis - Raptis. The equivalence for general Artin groups comes from some observations here and the characterization of separable Artin groups by Almeida - Lima.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>

      <title>Description Complexity of Unary Structures in First-Order Logic with Links to Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description complexity of a model is the length of the shortest formula that defines the model. We study the description complexity of unary structures in first-order logic FO, also drawing links to semantic complexity in the form of entropy. The class of unary structures provides, e.g., a simple way to represent tabular Boolean data sets as relational structures. We define structures with FO-formulas that are strictly linear in the size of the model as opposed to using the naive quadratic ones, and we use arguments based on formula size games to obtain related lower bounds for description complexity. For a typical structure the upper and lower bounds in fact match up to a sublinear term, leading to a precise asymptotic result on the expected description complexity of a randomly selected structure. We then give bounds on the relationship between Shannon entropy and description complexity. We extend this relationship also to Boltzmann entropy by establishing an asymptotic match between the two entropies. Despite the simplicity of unary structures, our arguments require the use of formula size games, Stirling's approximation and Chernoff bounds.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We strengthen a result of Bagaria and Magidor~\cite{MR3152715} about the relationship between large cardinals and torsion classes of abelian groups, and prove that (1) the \emph{Maximum Deconstructibility} principle introduced in \cite{Cox_MaxDecon} requires large cardinals; it sits, implication-wise, between Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. (2) While deconstructibility of a class of modules always implies the precovering property by \cite{MR2822215}, the concepts are (consistently) non-equivalent, even for classes of abelian groups closed under extensions, homomorphic images, and colimits.</description>

      <title>SAT Solving Using XOR-OR-AND Normal Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the XOR-OR-AND normal form (XNF) for logical formulas. It is a generalization of the well-known Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) where literals are replaced by XORs of literals. As a first theoretic result, we show that every CNF formula is equisatisfiable to a formula in 2-XNF, i.e., a formula in XNF where each clause involves at most two XORs of literals. Subsequently, we present an algorithm which converts Boolean polynomials efficiently from their Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) to formulas in 2-XNF. Experiments with the cipher ASCON-128 show that cryptographic problems, which by design are based strongly on XOR-operations, can be represented using far fewer variables and clauses in 2-XNF than in CNF. In order to take advantage of this compact representation, new SAT solvers based on input formulas in 2-XNF need to be designed. By taking inspiration from graph-based 2-CNF SAT solving, we devise a new DPLL-based SAT solver for formulas in 2-XNF. Among others, we present advanced pre- and in-processing techniques. Finally, we give timings for random 2-XNF instances and instances related to key recovery attacks on round reduced ASCON-128, where our solver outperforms state-of-the-art alternative solving approaches.</description>

      <title>Continuous Edge Chromatic Numbers of Abelian Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any generating set $S$ of $\mathbb {Z}^n$, the continuous edge chromatic number of the Schreier graph of the Bernoulli shift action $G=F(S,2^{\mathbb{Z}^n})$ is $\chi'_c(G)=\chi'(G)+1$. In particular, for the standard generating set, the continuous edge chromatic number of $F(2^{\mathbb {Z}^n})$ is $2n+1$.</description>
