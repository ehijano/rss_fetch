      <title>Invited: Neuromorphic architectures based on augmented silicon photonics platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss our vision for neuromorphic accelerators based on integrated photonics within the framework of the Horizon Europe NEUROPULS project. Augmented integrated photonic architectures that leverage phase-change and III-V materials for optical computing will be presented. A CMOS-compatible platform will be discussed that integrates these materials to fabricate photonic neuromorphic architectures, along with a gem5-based simulation platform to model accelerator operation once it is interfaced with a RISC-V processor. This simulation platform enables accurate system-level accelerator modeling and benchmarking in terms of key metrics such as speed, energy consumption, and footprint.</description>

      <title>Multi-person eye tracking for real-world scene perception in social settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Previous research suggests that eye movements are highly influenced by task, setting, and social others; however, most eye tracking research is conducted in single-person, in-lab settings and is yet to be validated in multi-person, naturalistic contexts. One such prevalent real-world context is the collective viewing of a shared scene in social settings, for example, viewing a concert, film, lecture, sports, etc. Here, we apply mobile eye tracking in a real-world multi-person setup and develop a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data. We tested our proposed, open-source system while participants (N=60) watched a live concert and a documentary film screening during a public event. We tackled challenges related to networking bandwidth requirements, real-time monitoring, and gaze projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. Our system achieves precise time synchronisation and accurate gaze projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Further, to illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data, we introduce and evaluate novel analysis metrics and visualisations. Overall, our approach contributes to the development and application of versatile multi-person eye tracking systems in real-world social settings. This advancement enables insight into collaborative behaviour, group dynamics, and social interaction, with high ecological validity. Moreover, it paves the path for innovative, interactive tools that promote collaboration and coordination in social contexts.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computing to address complex problems requiring high computational resources has long been hindered by the intrinsic and demanding requirements of quantum hardware development. Nonetheless, the current state of quantum computing, denominated Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, has introduced algorithms and methods that are able to harness the computational power of current quantum computers with advantages over classical computers (referred to as quantum advantage). Achieving quantum advantage is of particular relevance for the combinatorial optimization domain, since it often implies solving an NP-Hard optimization problem. Moreover, combinatorial problems are highly relevant for practical application areas, such as operations research, or resource allocation problems. Among quantum computing methods, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) have emerged as one of the strongest candidates towards reaching practical applicability of NISQ systems. This paper explores the current state and recent developments of VQAs, emphasizing their applicability to combinatorial optimization. We identify the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as the leading candidate for these problems. Furthermore, we implement QAOA circuits with varying depths to solve the MaxCut problem on graphs with 10 and 20 nodes, demonstrating the potential and challenges of using VQAs in practical optimization tasks. We release our code, dataset and optimized circuit parameters under https://github.com/DanielFPerez/VQA-for-MaxCut.</description>

      <title>Advantages of multistage quantum walks over QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods to find the solution state for optimization problems encoded into Ising Hamiltonians are a very active area of current research. In this work we compare the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with multi-stage quantum walks (MSQW). Both can be used as variational quantum algorithms, where the control parameters are optimized classically. A fair comparison requires both quantum and classical resources to be assessed. Alternatively, parameters can be chosen heuristically, as we do in this work, providing a simpler setting for comparisons. Using both numerical and analytical methods, we obtain evidence that MSQW outperforms QAOA, using equivalent resources. We also show numerically for random spin glass ground state problems that MSQW performs well even for few stages and heuristic parameters, with no classical optimization.</description>

      <title>A Differentially Private Blockchain-Based Approach for Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Differentially Private Blockchain-Based Vertical Federal Learning (DP-BBVFL) algorithm that provides verifiability and privacy guarantees for decentralized applications. DP-BBVFL uses a smart contract to aggregate the feature representations, i.e., the embeddings, from clients transparently. We apply local differential privacy to provide privacy for embeddings stored on a blockchain, hence protecting the original data. We provide the first prototype application of differential privacy with blockchain for vertical federated learning. Our experiments with medical data show that DP-BBVFL achieves high accuracy with a tradeoff in training time due to on-chain aggregation. This innovative fusion of differential privacy and blockchain technology in DP-BBVFL could herald a new era of collaborative and trustworthy machine learning applications across several decentralized application domains.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Tensor Networks for Laminate Design: A Novel Approach to Stacking Sequence Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.</description>
