      <title>Monotonous period function for equivariant differential equations with homogeneous nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the period function of the center at the origin of the $\mathbb{Z}_k$-equivariant differential equation $\dot{z}=iz+a(z\overline{z})^nz^{k+1}, a\ne0,$ is monotonous decreasing for all $n$ and $k$ positive integers, solving a conjecture about them. We show this result as corollary of proving that the period function of the center at the origin of a sub-family of the reversible quadratic centers is monotonous decreasing as well.</description>

      <title>Cassification of the trajectories of uncharged particles in the Schwarzschild-Melvin metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the trajectories of neutral particles in the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. After reduction by cyclic coordinates this problem reduces to investigating a two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system that has no additional integral. A classification of regions of possible motion of a particle is performed according to the values of the momentum and energy integrals. Bifurcations of periodic solutions of the reduced system are analyzed using a Poincare map.</description>

      <title>Examples in Discrete Iteration of Arbitrary Intervals of Slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact interval $[a,b] \subset [0,\pi]$, we construct a parabolic self-map of the upper half-plane whose set of slopes is $[a,b]$. The nature of this construction is completely discrete and explicit: we explicitly construct a self-map and we explicitly show in which way its orbits wander towards the Denjoy-Wolff point. We also analyze some properties of the Herglotz measure corresponding to such example, which yield the regularity of such self-map in its Denjoy-Wolff point.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for durable tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation in Dynamic Environments using Density Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work uses density functions for safe navigation in dynamic environments. The dynamic environment consists of time-varying obstacles as well as time-varying target sets. We propose an analytical construction of time-varying density functions to solve these navigation problems. The proposed approach leads to a time-varying feedback controller obtained as a positive gradient of the density function. This paper's main contribution is providing convergence proof using the analytically constructed density function for safe navigation in the presence of a dynamic obstacle set and time-varying target set. The results are the first of this kind developed for a system with integrator dynamics and open up the possibility for application to systems with more complex dynamics using methods based on control density function and inverse kinematic-based control design. We present the application of the developed approach for collision avoidance in multi-agent systems and robotic systems. While the theoretical results are produced for first-order integrator systems, we demonstrate how the framework can be applied for systems with non-trivial dynamics, such as Dubin's car model and fully actuated Euler-Lagrange system with robotics applications.</description>

      <title>The Product of linear forms over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the product of $n$ linear forms over function fields. We calculate the maximum value of the minima of the forms with determinant one when $n$ is small. The value is equal to the natural bound given by algebraic number theory. Our proof is based on a reduction theory of diagonal group orbits on homogeneous spaces. We also show that the forms defined algebraically correspond to periodic orbits with respect to the diagonal group actions.</description>

      <title>Environmental variability promotes the evolution of cooperation among geographically dispersed groups on dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolutionary process that led to the emergence of modern human behaviors during the Middle Stone Age in Africa remains enigmatic. While various hypotheses have been proposed, we offer a new perspective that integrates the variability selection hypothesis (VSH) with the evolution of cooperation among human groups. The VSH suggests that human adaptability to fluctuating environments was a primary force driving the development of key evolutionary traits. However, the mechanisms by which environmental variability (EV) influenced human evolution, particularly the emergence of large-scale and complex cooperative behaviors, are not yet fully understood. To explore the connection between intensified EV and the evolution of intergroup cooperation, we analyzed three stochastic models of EV: (i) Regional Variability (RV), where resource-rich areas shift while overall resource levels remain stable; (ii) Universal Variability (UV), where overall resource levels fluctuate but resource-rich areas remain stable; and (iii) Combined Variability (CV), where both resource-rich areas shift and overall resource levels fluctuate. Our results show that RV strongly promotes cooperation, while UV has a comparatively weaker effect. Additionally, our findings indicate that the coevolution of cooperation and network structures is crucial for EVs to effectively promote cooperation. This study proposes a novel causal link between EV and the evolution of cooperation, potentially setting a new direction for both theoretical and empirical research in this field.</description>

      <title>Horizons of some asymptotically stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a class of dynamical spacetimes which are asymptotic as $t\to\infty$ to a stationary spacetime containing a horizon $\mathcal{H}_0$, we show the existence of a unique null hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ which is asymptotic to $\mathcal{H}_0$. This is a special case of a general unstable manifold theorem for perturbations of flows which translate in time and have a normal sink at an invariant manifold in space. Examples of horizons $\mathcal{H}_0$ to which our result applies include event horizons of subextremal Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes as well as event and cosmological horizons of subextremal Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes. In the Kerr(-Newman) case, we show that $\mathcal{H}$ is equal to the boundary of the black hole region of the dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study forest-skein (FS) groups using dynamics. A simple Ore FS category produces three FS groups analogous to Richard Thompson's groups. Reconstruction theorems of McCleary and Rubin apply to these FS groups: each of them encodes a canonical rigid group action and thus carries powerful dynamical invariants. We then explicitly construct infinitely many isomorphism classes of finitely presented (of type $F_\infty$) infinite simple groups which act faithfully on the circle by (orientation-preserving) homeomorphisms, but admit no non-trivial finite piecewise linear actions nor finite piecewise projective actions. To the best of our knowledge these are the first examples witnessing these properties. We also show these groups fit into the finite germ extension framework of Belk, Hyde, and Matucci.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of non-autonomous systems with nested invariant cone structure and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current paper is devoted to the investigation of the influence of nested invariant cone structure on the dynamics, in the context of non-autonomous (time almost periodic)cases. We first prove that the nested invariant cone structure can persistent under C1 perturbations; and the dynamics of the omega-limit set of any precompact orbit can be reduced to the dynamics of a compact invariant of a suitable finite dimensional system(see Theorem 2.1). In some special cases, the dynamics of any omega-limit set generated by the skew product semiflow of such a system is similar to a one-dimensional system, that is, the omega-limit set contains at most two minimal sets, and any minimal set is an almost automorphic extension of its base flow(a universal phenomenon in multi-frequency driven systems, introduced by S. Bochner), these results are also correct for such systems under C1 small perturbations(see Theorems 2.2, 2.3). To our best knowledge, it is the first paper to touch the global dynamics of abstract non-autonomous systems with invariant nested cones; the setting is general, since it contains an autonomous system plus an almost-periodic perturbation term, and a periodic system with another periodic perturbation term (these two periods are irrationally dependent)as special cases. The results can be viewed as a generalization of important works of W. Shen and Y. Yi(1995 J. Differential Equations 122 114-136) for scalar parabolic equations with separated boundary conditions, Y. Wang(2007 Nonlinearity 20 831-843) for tridiagonal competitive cooperative systems(see Section 4).</description>

      <title>Synchronizing Dynamical Systems: Shift Spaces and $K$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our previous work, we give a thorough presentation of the techniques developed for synchronizing dynamical systems in the special case of synchronizing shift spaces. Following work of Thomsen, we give a construction of the homoclinic, the heteroclinic, and synchronizing heteroclinic $C^\ast$-algebras along with the synchronizing ideal of a shift space in terms of Bratteli diagrams. The algebras introduced in our previous work (the synchronizing ideal, and synchronizing heteroclinic algebra) are discussed in detail. In the sofic shift case, these algebras are shown to be related to the $C^\ast$-algebras of its minimal left and minimal right presentations. Several specific examples are discussed to demonstrate these techniques. For the even shift we give a complete computation of all the associated invariants. We discuss these algebras for a sofic shift that is not of almost finite type and for a number of strictly non-sofic synchronizing shifts. In particular we discuss the rank of the $K$-theory of the homoclinic algebra of a shift space and its synchronizing ideal and its implications. We also give a construction for producing from any minimal shift a synchronizing shift whose set of non-synchronizing points is exactly the original minimal shift.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give an explicit solution to Zariski's moduli problem for plane branches. We compute (in an algorithmic way) the set of K\"{a}hler differentials of an irreducible germ of holomorphic plane curve. We show that there is a basis of this set whose main elements correspond to dicritical foliations. Indeed, we discuss several concepts of generation for the semimodule of values of K\"{a}hler differentials of the curve and provide basis of K\"{a}hler differentials, for every of these concepts, whose geometric properties are described. Moreover, we give an algorithmic construction of the bases.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. We prove the continuity of limit cones along deformations of Anosov subgroups of $G$ under a certain convexity assumption. This convexity assumption turns out to be necessary. We discuss an application to the notion of sharpness of an action of a discrete subgroup on a non-Riemannian homogeneous space. We also obtain that growth indicators, certain critical exponents and the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets vary continuously in the space of Anosov representations.</description>
