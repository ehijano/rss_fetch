      <title>A detailed field theory for RNA-like molecules with periodic base sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines a field theory for RNA-like molecules in a good solvent. The field theory is based on a lattice model for single- and double-strand RNA with a periodic base sequence, and otherwise contains all known relevant details (polymer types, polymer lengths and interactions). As for the somewhat less explicit $O\left(n\right)$-symmetric model there is a close relation to the conventional one-component branched polymer and the associated Lee-Yang problem. We further elucidate this relation. We derive exact results in the limiting cases of nearly complete denaturation and nearly complete renaturation. The single-strand critical exponent $\nu_{\varphi}$ is calculated in two-loop order.</description>

      <title>Escape into the Third Dimension in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer winding disclinations are unstable in a nematic and are removed by an `escape into the third dimension', resulting in a non-singular texture. This process is frustrated in a cholesteric material due to the requirement of maintaining a uniform handedness and instead results in the formation of strings of point defects, as well as complex three-dimensional solitons such as heliknotons that consist of linked dislocations. We give a complete description of this frustration using methods of contact topology. Furthermore, we describe how this frustration can be exploited to stabilise regions of the material where the handedness differs from the preferred handedness. These `twist solitons' are stable in numerical simulation and are a new form of topological defect in cholesteric materials that have not previously been studied.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Microscopic Structural Transition and Macroscopic Mechanical Properties of Magnetic Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic gels with embedded micro/nano-sized magnetic particles in crosslinked polymer networks can be actuated by external magnetic fields, with changes in their internal microscopic structures and macroscopic mechanical properties. We investigate the responses of such magnetic gels to an external magnetic field, by means of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the dynamics of magnetic particles are determined by the interplay of between magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, polymer elasticity and thermal fluctuations. The corresponding microscopic structures formed by the magnetic particles such as elongated chains can be controlled by the external magnetic field. Furthermore, the magnetic gels can exhibit reinforced macroscopic mechanical properties, where the elastic modulus increases algebraically with the magnetic moments of the particles in the form of $\propto(m-m_{\mathrm{c}})^{2}$ when magnetic chains are formed. This simulation work can not only serve as a tool for studying the microscopic and the macroscopic responses of the magnetic gels, but also facilitate future fabrications and practical controls of magnetic composites with desired physical properties.</description>

      <title>Investigating model influence on the analytical resolution of neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron reflectometry is a critical tool for investigating the structure of thin films and interfaces. However, the misapplication of the Born approximation to reflection geometry leads some to assume that the minimum thickness that may be probed by neutron reflectometry is limited by the Q-range of the measurement. In this study, we use model-dependent analysis, multiple isotopic contrasts, and magnetic spin states, to show that it is possible to resolve structures significantly smaller than this perceived limit. To quantify this "analytical resolution", we employ Bayesian model selection, offering a robust and quantifiable comparison between different analytical models. We believe that this work offers pivotal insights for the analysis of neutron reflectometry and hope that it will contribute to more accurate and information-rich analyses in the future.</description>

      <title>Active Nematic Ratchet in Asymmetric Obstacle Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of a periodic array of asymmetric obstacles in a two-dimensional active nematic. We find that activity in conjunction with the asymmetry leads to a ratchet effect or unidirectional flow of the fluid along the asymmetry direction. The directional flow is still present even in the active turbulent phase when the gap between obstacles is sufficiently small. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the topological defects transition from flow-mirroring to smectic-like as the gap between obstacles is made smaller, and explain this transition in terms of the pinning of negative winding number defects between obstacles. This also leads to a non-monotonic ratchet effect magnitude as a function of obstacle size, so that there is an optimal obstacle size for ratcheting at fixed activity.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject to linear friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make progress towards the development of a theory on the motion of inclusions in thin structured films and membranes, we here consider as an initial step a circular disk in a two-dimensional, uniaxially anisotropic fluid layer. We assume overdamped dynamics, incompressibility of the fluid, and global alignment of the axis of anisotropy. Motion within this layer is affected by additional linear friction with the environment, for instance, a supporting substrate. We investigate the induced flows in the fluid when the disk is translated parallel or perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy. Moreover, expressions for corresponding mobilities and resistance coefficients of the disk are derived. Our results are obtained within the framework of a perturbative expansion in the parameters that quantify the anisotropy of the fluid. Good agreement is found for moderate anisotropy when compared to associated results from finite-element simulations. At pronounced anisotropy, the induced flow fields are still predicted qualitatively correctly by the perturbative theory, although quantitative deviations arise. We hope to stimulate with our investigations corresponding experimental analyses, for example, concerning fluid flows in anisotropic thin films on uniaxially rubbed supporting substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a direct Monte Carlo simulation of the diffusion in a multicomponent granular medium. We investigate the diffusion coefficients and mean-squared displacements of granular particles in a polydisperse granular gas in a homogeneous cooling state containing an arbitrary number of species of different sizes and masses using both models of constant and time-dependent restitution coefficients. In our study, we used a powerful low-rank algorithm that allows for efficient simulation of highly polydisperse granular systems. Mean square displacements in Monte Carlo simulations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Surfactant-Driven Dynamic Changes in Rheology of Activated Carbon Slurry Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slurry electrodes are an effective means to improve flow battery performance by reducing electrode fouling and increasing the active surface area necessary for electrochemical reactions. It is critical to understand how the slurry formulation impacts its rheological profile and ultimately battery performance. We study the linear and nonlinear rheology of activated carbon (AC) based slurry electrode used in an all-iron flow battery in the presence of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100). Our results show the slurry mimics a colloidal gel with elasticity remaining constant despite increasing surfactant concentration until $\alpha$(=C$_{surf.}$/C$_{AC}$) &lt; 0.65. However, at $\alpha \ge$ 0.65, the slurry abruptly transitions to a fluid with no measurable yield stress. This critical surfactant concentration at which the rheological profile undergoes a dynamic change matches the concentration found previously for gel collapse of this system. Moreover, this transition is accompanied by a complete loss of electrical conductivity. These data show that site specific adsorption of surfactant molecules often used in slurry formulation have a significant and dramatic impact on flow behavior, which should be considered when formulating a slurry electrode.</description>

      <title>Undulatory swimming in suspensions and networks of flexible filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological fluids are composed of suspended polymers immersed in a viscous fluid. A prime example is mucus, where the polymers are also known to form a network. While the presence of this microstructure is linked with an overall non-Newtonian response of the fluid, swimming cells and microorganisms similar in size to the network pores and polymer filaments instead experience the heterogeneous nature of the environment, interacting directly with the polymers as obstacles as they swim. To characterise and understand locomotion in these heterogeneous environments, we simulate the motion of an undulatory swimmer through suspensions and networks of elastic filaments, exploring the effects of filament and link compliance and filament concentration up to 20\% volume fraction. For compliant environments, the swimming speed increases with filament concentration to values about 10\% higher than in a viscous fluid. In stiffer environments, a non-monotonic dependence is observed, with an initial increase in speed to values 5\% greater than in a viscous fluid, followed by a dramatic reduction to speeds just a fraction of its value in a viscous fluid. Velocity fluctuations are also more pronounced in stiffer environments. We demonstrate that speed enhancements are linked to hydrodynamic interactions with the microstructure, while reductions are due to the filaments restricting the amplitude of the swimmer's propulsive wave. Unlike previous studies where interactions with obstacles allowed for significant enhancements in swimming speeds, the modest enhancements seen here are more comparable to those given by models where the environment is treated as a continuous viscoelastic fluid.</description>

      <title>The trimer paradox: the effect of stiff constraints on equilibrium distributions in overdamped dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method of calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.</description>

      <title>Extended Spreading of Saline Droplets upon Impact on a Frosty Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solidification dynamics of impacted water droplets is fundamental and crucial for applications, especially with the presence of frost and salt. Here, we experimentally investigate the spreading and freezing dynamics of saline droplets upon impact on a cold, frosty surface. Our findings demonstrate that the frost and salt can lead to an extended spreading of impacted droplets under specific conditions. In addition to the well-known 1/2 inertial spreading scaling law for droplets impact on a cold substrate, we observe a distinct transition to a 1/10 scaling law dominated by the capillary-viscous relation at low impacting velocities. We formulate the onset criterion for this extended spreading regime and derive a scaling dependence that captures the droplet's arrested diameter over various supercooling temperatures, by incorporating the effect of impact inertia, partial-wetting behavior and salinity. Based on the analysis, a unified model is proposed for predicting the droplet arrested diameter over a wide range of impact velocity and salinity.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Multiscale Modeling of the Facet Capsular Ligament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, zero strain energy with zero deformations, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that for this neural network, the accuracy is significantly improved by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our network and Sobolev minimization, we obtain a NMSE of 0.15% for the energy, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness. This machine learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves where compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU based supercomputer. At 70% strain, the model using the neural network had less than 10% relative error in the mean stress value.</description>

      <title>Effective model of protein--mediated interactions in chromatin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-mediated interactions are ubiquitous in the cellular environment, and particularly in the nucleus, where they are responsible for the structuring of chromatin. We show through molecular--dynamics simulations of a polymer surrounded by binders that the strength of the binder-polymer interaction separates an equilibrium from a non-equilibrium regime. In the equilibrium regime, the system can be efficiently described by an effective model in which the binders are traced out. Even in this case, the polymer display features that are different from those of a standard homopolymer interacting with two-body interactions. We then extend the effective model to deal with the case where binders cannot be regarded as in equilibrium and a new phenomenology appears, including local blobs in the polymer. Providing an effective description of the system can be useful in clarifying the fundamental mechanisms governing chromatin structuring.</description>

      <title>Rearrangements during slow compression of a jammed two-dimensional emulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As amorphous materials get jammed, both geometric and dynamic heterogeneity are observed. We investigate the correlation between the local geometric heterogeneity and local rearrangements in a slowly compressed bidisperse quasi-two-dimensional emulsion system. The compression is driven by evaporation of the continuous phase, and causes the area packing fraction to increase from 0.88 to 0.99. We quantify the structural heterogeneity of the system using the radical Voronoi tessellation following the method of [Rieser et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 088001 (2016)]. We define two structural quantities characterizing local structure, the first which considers nearest neighbors and the second of which includes information from second nearest neighbors. We find that droplets in heterogeneous local regions are more likely to have local rearrangements. These rearrangements are generally T1 events where two droplets converge toward a void, and two droplets move away from the void to make room for the converging droplets. Thus the presence of the voids tends to orient the T1 events. The presence of a correlation between the structural quantities and the rearrangement dynamics remains qualitatively unchanged over the entire range of packing fractions observed.</description>

Abstract: Our understanding of the three basic states of matter (solids, liquids and gases) is based on temperature and pressure phase diagrams with three phase transition lines: solid-gas, liquid-gas and solid-liquid lines. There are analytical expressions $P(T)$ for the first two lines derived on a purely general-theoretical thermodynamic basis. In contrast, there exists no similar function for the third, melting, line (ML). Here, we develop a general two-phase theory of MLs and their analytical form. This theory predicts the parabolic form of the MLs for normal melting, relates the MLs to thermal and elastic properties of liquid and solid phases and quantitatively agrees with experimental MLs in different system types. We show that the parameters of the ML parabola are governed by fundamental physical constants. In this sense, parabolic MLs possess universality across different systems.</description>

Abstract: If two phases exist at the same time, such as a gas and a liquid, they have the same temperature. This fundamental law of equilibrium physics is known to apply even to many non-equilibrium systems. However, recently, there has been much attention in the finding that inertial self-propelled particles like Janus colloids in a plasma or microflyers could self-organize into a hot gas-like phase that coexists with a colder liquid-like phase. Here, we show that a kinetic temperature difference across coexisting phases can occur even in equilibrium systems when adding generic (overdamped) self-propelled particles. In particular, we consider mixtures of overdamped active and inertial passive Brownian particles and show that when they phase separate into a dense and a dilute phase, both phases have different kinetic temperatures. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase (liquid) cannot only be colder but also hotter than the dilute phase (gas). This effect hinges on correlated motions where active particles collectively push and heat up passive ones primarily within the dense phase. Our results answer the fundamental question if a non-equilibrium gas can be colder than a coexisting liquid and create a route to equip matter with self-organized domains of different kinetic temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Phototaxis, the directed motion in response to a light stimulus, is crucial for motile microorganisms that rely on photosynthesis, such as the unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It is well known that microalgae adapt to ambient light stimuli. On time scales of several dozen minutes, when stimulated long enough, the response of the microalga evolves as if the light intensity were decreasing (Mayer, Nature 1968). Here, we show experimentally that microalgae also have a short-term memory, on the time scale of a couple of minutes, which is the opposite of adaptation. At these short time scales, when stimulated consecutively, the response of C. reinhardtii evolves as if the light intensity were increasing. Our experimental results are rationalized by the introduction of a simplified model of phototaxis. Memory comes from the interplay between an internal biochemical time scale and the time scale of the stimulus; as such, these memory effects are likely to be widespread in phototactic microorganisms.</description>
