      <title>Expert Incentives under Partially Contractible States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study whether and which expert incentives can be provided at what cost when the states of the world become non-contractible, but there is some noisy observation about the states that can be contracted upon. A principal hires an agent to acquire costly information about the states, but it is not possible to pay the agent based on the realized states. Instead, the principal has access to a noisy (Blackwell) experiment about the states, and can pay bonuses based on its realization. The agent is risk neutral and protected by limited liability. I completely characterize what the principal can incentivize the agent to learn, and how to design contracts to minimize the costs to provide such incentives. I then study which contractible information is always better at incentive provision. This gives rise to a novel order on information. In the binary-binary case, this order is characterized by larger differences in the likelihood ratios of the two realizations. My results provide insights into what information is better for evaluating expert predictions.</description>

      <title>Two-Instrument Screening under Soft Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study soft budget constraints in multi-tier public finance when an upper-tier government uses two instruments: an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post rescue. Under convex rescue costs and standard primitives, the three-stage leader-follower problem collapses to one dimensional screening with a single allocation index: the cap on realized rescue. A hazard-based characterization delivers a unified rule that nests (i) no rescue, (ii) a threshold-cap with commitment, and (iii) a threshold--linear--cap without commitment. The knife-edge for eliminating bailouts compares the marginal cost at the origin to the supremum of a virtual weight, and the comparative statics show how greater curvature tightens caps while discretion shifts transfers toward front loading by lowering the effective grant weight. The framework provides a portable benchmark for mechanism design and yields testable implications for policy and empirical work on intergovernmental finance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>

      <title>Ambiguous Persuasion: An Ex-Ante Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05376v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a persuasion game where both the sender and receiver are ambiguity averse with maxmin expected utility (MEU) preferences and the sender can choose an ambiguous information structure. This paper analyzes the game in an ex-ante formulation: the sender first commits to an information structure, and then the receiver best responds by choosing an ex-ante message-contingent action plan. Under this formulation, I show it is never strictly beneficial for the sender to use an ambiguous information structure as opposed to a standard unambiguous one. This result is robust to (i) the players having heterogeneous beliefs over the states, and/or (ii) the receiver having non-MEU, uncertainty-averse preferences. However, it is \emph{not} robust to the sender having non-MEU preferences.</description>

      <title>Bargaining with transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and axiomatise a solution to the problem of bargaining when transfers between agents are possible. Each player receives a weighted sum of the claims of the coalitions to which she belongs minus a weighted sum of the claims of the other coalitions, where a coalition's claim is determined by its best allocation in the bargaining set. Our key axioms are additivity and a property we term allocation monotonicity, which concerns the effect of adding an allocation to the bargaining set.</description>

      <title>Risk Sharing Among Many: Implementing a Subgame Perfect and Optimal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can a welfare-maximising risk-sharing rule be implemented in a large, decentralised community? We revisit the price-and-choose (P&amp;C) mechanism of Echenique and N\'u\~nez (2025), in which players post price schedules sequentially and the last mover selects an allocation. P&amp;C implements every Pareto-optimal allocation when the choice set is finite, but realistic risk-sharing problems involve an infinite continuum of feasible allocations. We extend P&amp;C to infinite menus by modelling each allocation as a bounded random vector that redistributes an aggregate loss $X=\sum_i X_i$. We prove that the extended mechanism still implements the allocation that maximises aggregate (monetary) utility, even when players entertain heterogeneous credal sets of finitely additive probabilities (charges) dominated by a reference probability $\mathbb{P}$. Our credal sets are weak$^{\ast}$-compact and are restricted so that expectation functionals are uniformly Lipschitz on the feasible set. Finally, we pair P&amp;C with the first-mover auction of Echenique and N\'u\~nez (2025), adapted to our infinite-menu, multiple-prior environment. With a public signal about the common surplus, the auction equalises (conditional) expected surplus among participants. The result is a decentralised, enforcement-free procedure that achieves both optimal and fair risk sharing under heterogeneous priors.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of Experiments in Moral Hazard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I use a novel geometric approach to compare information in moral hazard problems. I study three nested geometric orders on information, namely the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope orders. The orders are defined by the inclusion of the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope of the matrices representing the experiments. For each order, I establish four equivalent characterizations of the orders (i) inclusion of feasible state dependent utility sets, (ii) matrix factorizations, (iii) posterior belief distributions, and (iv) improved incentives in certain moral hazard problems. The column space order characterizes the comparison of implementability in all moral hazard problems. The conic span order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems with a risk neutral agent and limited liability. The zonotope order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems when the agent can have any utility exhibiting risk aversion.</description>
