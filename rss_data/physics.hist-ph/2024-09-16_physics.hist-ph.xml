      <title>The Ancient Egyptian Cosmological Vignette: First Visual Evidence of the Milky Way and Trends in Coffin Depictions of the Sky Goddess Nut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several studies have argued that the Milky Way was a representation of the ancient Egyptian sky goddess Nut. Here, I test this assumption by examining Nut's visual depictions on ancient Egyptian coffins. I assemble a catalog of 555 coffin elements, which includes 118 cosmological vignettes from the 21st/22nd Dynasties, and report several observations. First, I find that the cosmological vignette on the outer coffin of Nesitaudjatakhet bears a unique feature: a thick, undulating black curve that bisects Nut's star-studded body and recalls the Great Rift that cleaves the Milky Way in two. Moreover, it resembles similar features identified as the Milky Way on the bodies of Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni spiritual beings. Hence, I argue that the undulating curve on Nut's body is the first visual representation of the Milky Way identified in the Egyptian archaeological record. However, its rarity strengthens the conclusion reached by Graur (2024a): Though Nut and the Milky Way are linked, they are not synonymous. Instead of acting as a representation of Nut, the Milky Way is one more celestial phenomenon that, like the Sun and the stars, is associated with Nut in her role as the sky. Second, Nut's body is decorated with stars in only a quarter of the vignettes. If we associate Nut's naked and star-studded forms with the day and night sky, respectively, we would expect to see stars in half of the vignettes. This null hypothesis is rejected at $&gt;6\sigma$ statistical significance. For whatever reason, it appears that the Egyptians of the 21st/22nd Dynasties preferred the day sky over the night sky. Finally, I discuss the interplay between Nut's cosmological vignette and full-length portraits inside coffins from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period in light of Nut's combined cosmological and eschatological roles as an embodiment of the coffin.</description>

      <title>Torres funerarias chullpa en el valle del r\'io Lauca: un primer an\'alisis arqueoastron\'omico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we employ the methods of archaeoastronomy to analyze the orientation, possibly astronomical, of numerous groups of chullpa funerary towers, mainly from the 12th to 16th centuries, located in the Lauca River valley of the central Bolivian highlands. Despite their great historical relevance, both regarding the beliefs and funerary customs of the local populations and the characteristics of the landscape in the highlands, little is known about the relationship of these mortuary monuments with the sky. Several authors, from chroniclers of the colonial era to more modern explorers, indicate that the tomb towers of these regions are oriented in such a way that important parts of their structure (in general, the entrances of the chullpas) point towards the sunrise on the eastern horizon, in order to be imbued with the first rays of the Sun. However, the sunrise changes its location noticeably at different times of the year. Given the lack of written information or other forms of original documentation, in order to affirm the use of a systematic orientation, it is necessary to measure a statistically significant number of monuments. We present here the results of the analysis of the precise spatial orientation of the entrances of 80 towers measured in situ during field work in the Lauca River valley. We find that, except for a few, all the buildings have the openings' axes oriented towards the east and within the solar range, between the extreme azimuths of the annual movement of the Sun as it crosses the local horizon, with a notable concentration of entrances that point slightly towards the north of due east. Our work is the first systematic study of the orientations of the chullpa towers of the Lauca River and can provide crucial information to understand the evolution and scope of the chullpa phenomenon in the Bolivian highlands and in the entire surrounding region.</description>

      <title>A proposal for a metaphysics of self-subsisting structures. II. Quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents an extension of the metaphysics of self-subsisting structures set out in a companion paper to the realm of non-relativistic quantum physics. The discussion is centered around a Pure Shape Dynamics model representing a relational implementation of a de Broglie-Bohm $N$-body system. An interpretation of this model in terms of self-subsisting structures is proposed and assessed against the background of the debate on the metaphysics of quantum physics, with a particular emphasis on the nature of the wave function. The analysis shows that elaborating an appropriate Leibnizian/Machian metaphysics of the quantum world requires a substantial revision of the notion of world-building relation.</description>

      <title>How Haag-tied is QFT, really?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haag's theorem cries out for explanation and critical assessment: it sounds the alarm that something is (perhaps) not right in one of the standard way of constructing interacting fields to be used in generating predictions for scattering experiments. Viewpoints as to the precise nature of the problem, the appropriate solution, and subsequently-called-for developments in areas of physics, mathematics, and philosophy differ widely. In this paper, we develop and deploy a conceptual framework for critically assessing these disparate responses to Haag's theorem. Doing so reveals the driving force of more general questions as to the nature and purpose of foundational work in physics.</description>

      <title>Arrival time and Bohmian Mechanics: It is the theory which decides what we can measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze recent proposals by Das and D\"{u}rr (DD) to measure the arrival time distributions of quantum particles within the framework of de Broglie Bohm theory (or Bohmian mechanics). We also analyze the criticisms made by Goldstein Tumulka and Zangh\`{i} (GTZ) of these same proposals, and show that each protagonist is both right and wrong. In fine, we show that DD's predictions are indeed measurable in principle, but that they will not lead to violations of the no-signalling theorem used in Bell's theorem, in contradiction with some of Das and Maudlin's hopes.</description>
