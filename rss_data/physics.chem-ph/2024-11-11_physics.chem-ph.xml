      <title>Enhancing Accuracy and Feature Insights in Hydration Free Energy Predictions for Small Molecules with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of solvation free energy is of significant importance as it governs the behavior of solutes in solution. In this work, we apply a variety of machine learning techniques to predict and analyze the alchemical free energy of small molecules. Our methodology incorporates an ensemble of machine learning models with feature processing using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. Two training strategies are explored: one based on experimental data, and the other based on the offset between molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental measurements. The latter approach yields a substantial improvement in predictive accuracy, achieving a mean unsigned error (MUE) of 0.64 kcal/mol. Feature analysis identifies molecular geometry and topology as the most critical factors in predicting alchemical free energy, supporting the established theory that surface tension is a key determinant. Furthermore, the feature analysis of offset results highlights the relevance of charge distribution within the system, which correlates with the inaccuracies in force fields employed in MD simulations and may provide guidance for improving force field designs. These results suggest that machine learning approaches can effectively capture the complex features governing solvation free energy, offering novel pathways for enhancing predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Diagonalization without Diagonalization: A Direct Optimization Approach for Solid-State Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to address the challenges of variable occupation numbers in direct optimization of density functional theory (DFT). By parameterizing both the eigenfunctions and the occupation matrix, our method minimizes the free energy with respect to these parameters. As the stationary conditions require the occupation matrix and the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian to be simultaneously diagonalizable, this leads to the concept of ``self-diagonalization,'' where, by assuming a diagonal occupation matrix without loss of generality, the Hamiltonian matrix naturally becomes diagonal at stationary points. Our method incorporates physical constraints on both the eigenfunctions and the occupations into the parameterization, transforming the constrained optimization into an fully differentiable unconstrained problem, which is solvable via gradient descent. Implemented in JAX, our method was tested on aluminum and silicon, confirming that it achieves efficient self-diagonalization, produces the correct Fermi-Dirac distribution of the occupation numbers and yields band structures consistent with those obtained with SCF methods in Quantum Espresso.</description>

      <title>Disentangling enhanced diffusion and ballistic motion of excitons coupled to Bloch surface waves with molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Placing an organic material on top of a Bragg mirror can significantly enhance exciton transport. Such enhancement has been attributed to strong coupling between the evanescent Bloch surface waves (BSW) on the mirror, and the excitons in the material. In this regime, the BSW and excitons hybridize into Bloch surface wave polaritons (BSWP), new quasi-particles with both photonic and excitonic character. While recent experiments unveiled a mixed nature of the enhanced transport, the role of the material degrees of freedom in this process remains unclear. To clarify their role, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of an ensemble of Methylene blue molecules, a prototype organic emitter, strongly coupled to a BSW. In contrast to the established static models of polaritons, even with disorder included, our dynamic simulations reveal a correlation between the photonic content of the BSWP and the nature of the transport. In line with experiment, we find ballistic motion for polaritons with high photonic character, and enhanced diffusion if the photonic content is low. Our simulations furthermore suggest that the diffusion is due to thermally activated vibrations that drive population transfer between the stationary dark states and mobile bright polaritonic states.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional quantum dynamics with explicitly correlated Gaussian wave packets using Rothe's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous publication [J. Chem. Phys., 161, 044105 (2024)], it has been shown that Rothe's method can be used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom in a strong laser field using time-dependent Gaussian wave packets. Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.</description>

      <title>The influence of geometry and specific electronic and nuclear energy deposition on ion-stimulated desorption from thin self-supporting membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the yield of positive secondary ions created upon impact of primary He, B and Ne ions on geometry and electronic and nuclear energy deposition by the projectiles. We employ pulsed beams in the medium energy regime and a large position-sensitive, time-of-flight detection system to ensure accurate quantification. As a target, we employ a single crystalline Si(100) self-supporting 50 nm thick membrane thus featuring two identical surfaces enabling simultaneous measurements in backscattering and transmission geometry. Electronic sputtering is identified as the governing mechanism for the desorption of hydrogen and molecular species found on the surfaces. Nevertheless, larger energy deposition to the nuclear subsystem by heavier projectiles as well as due to the directionality of the collision cascade appears to act in synergy with the electronic energy deposition leading to an overall increase in secondary ion yields. A higher yield of ions sputtered from the matrix is observed in transmission geometry only for B and Ne ions, consistent with the observed role of nuclear stopping.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of the possible thermodynamic origin of water's anomalies in non-classical vapor nucleation at negative pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the years, various scenarios -- such as the stability-limit conjecture (SLC), two critical point (TCP), critical point-free (CPF), and singularity-free (SF) -- have been proposed to explain the thermodynamic origin of supercooled waters anomalies. However, direct experimental validation is challenging due to the rapid phase transition from metastable water. In this study, we explored whether the phase transition pathways from metastable water provide insight into the thermodynamic origin of these anomalies. Using a classical density functional theory approach with realistic theoretical water models, we examined how different thermodynamic scenarios influence vapor nucleation kinetics at negative pressures. Our findings show significant variations in nucleation kinetics and mechanism during both isobaric and isochoric cooling. In the TCP scenario, the nucleation barrier increases steadily during isobaric cooling, with a slight decrease near the Widom line at lower temperatures (Ts). In contrast, the SF scenario shows a monotonic increase in the nucleation barrier. For the CPF scenario, we observed a non-classical mechanism, such as wetting-mediated nucleation (where the growing vapor nucleus is wetted by the intermediate low-density liquid phase) and the Ostwald step rule at low temperatures. Isochoric cooling pathways also revealed notable differences in T-dependent nucleation barrier trends between the TCP and CPF scenarios. Overall, this study underscores the importance of analyzing phase transition kinetics and mechanism to understand the precise thermodynamic origin of supercooled waters anomalies.</description>

      <title>How grain structure evolution affects kinetics of a solid-state reaction: a case of interaction between iridium and zirconium carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the solid-state reaction between iridium and zirconium carbide, resulting in the formation of carbon and $\mathrm{ZrIr}_{3}$ -- an intermetallic compound of great interest for modern high-temperature materials science. We have found a transition of kinetic regimes in this reaction: from linear kinetics (when the chemical reaction is a limiting stage) at 1500 and 1550{\deg}C to `non-parabolic kinetics' at 1600{\deg}C. Non-parabolic kinetics is characterized by thickness of a product layer being proportional to a power of time less than 1/2. The nature of non-parabolic kinetics was still an open question, which motivated us to develop a model of this kinetic regime. The proposed model accounts for the grain growth in the product phase and how it leads to the time dependence of the interdiffusion coefficient. We have obtained a complete analytic solution for this model and an equation that connects the grain-growth exponent and the power-law exponent of non-parabolic kinetics. The measurements of the thickness of the product layer and the average grain size of the intermetallic phase confirm the results of the theoretical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general technique to produce cold spin-polarized molecules, in which rotationally excited states are first populated by coherent microwave excitation, and then allowed to spin-flip and relax via collisional quenching, which populates a single final spin state. We illustrate the high selectivity of the technique for $^{13}$C$^{16}$O molecules immersed in a cold buffer gas of helium atoms, achieving a high degree ($\geq$95\%) of nuclear spin polarization at 1 K.</description>

      <title>Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments, especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge density, which significantly improves the efficiency of the method, particularly for large MM systems, and for typical calculations effectively eliminates the dependence on MM system size. We also show how the DRF approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred dipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of acrolein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>DiffBatt: A Diffusion Model for Battery Degradation Prediction and Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Battery degradation remains a critical challenge in the pursuit of green technologies and sustainable energy solutions. Despite significant research efforts, predicting battery capacity loss accurately remains a formidable task due to its complex nature, influenced by both aging and cycling behaviors. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel general-purpose model for battery degradation prediction and synthesis, DiffBatt. Leveraging an innovative combination of conditional and unconditional diffusion models with classifier-free guidance and transformer architecture, DiffBatt achieves high expressivity and scalability. DiffBatt operates as a probabilistic model to capture uncertainty in aging behaviors and a generative model to simulate battery degradation. The performance of the model excels in prediction tasks while also enabling the generation of synthetic degradation curves, facilitating enhanced model training by data augmentation. In the remaining useful life prediction task, DiffBatt provides accurate results with a mean RMSE of 196 cycles across all datasets, outperforming all other models and demonstrating superior generalizability. This work represents an important step towards developing foundational models for battery degradation.</description>

      <title>Towards Nanoscale and Element-Specific Lattice Temperature Measurements using Core-Loss Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift is due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity and thus accuracy compared to PEET, core-loss thermometry still has important advantages. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex materials. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion unless the temperature-dependent effective mass and dielectric constant are known. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.</description>
