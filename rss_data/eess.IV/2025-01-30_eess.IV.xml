      <title>Depth Separable architecture for Sentinel-5P Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentinel-5P (S5P) satellite provides atmospheric measurements for air quality and climate monitoring. While the S5P satellite offers rich spectral resolution, it inherits physical limitations that restricts its spatial resolution. Super-resolution (SR) techniques can overcome these limitations and enhance the spatial resolution of S5P data. In this work, we introduce a novel SR model specifically designed for S5P data that have eight spectral bands with around 500 channels for each band. Our proposed S5-DSCR model relies on Depth Separable Convolution (DSC) architecture to effectively perform spatial SR by exploiting cross-channel correlations. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing methods for the majority of the spectral bands. This work highlights the potential of leveraging DSC architecture to address the challenges of hyperspectral SR. Our model allows for capturing fine details necessary for precise analysis and paves the way for advancements in air quality monitoring as well as remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>MR imaging in the low-field: Leveraging the power of machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent innovations in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) hardware and software have reignited interest in low-field ($&lt;1\,\mathrm{T}$) and ultra-low-field MRI ($&lt;0.1\,\mathrm{T}$). These technologies offer advantages such as lower power consumption, reduced specific absorption rate, reduced field-inhomogeneities, and cost-effectiveness, presenting a promising alternative for resource-limited and point-of-care settings. However, low-field MRI faces inherent challenges like reduced signal-to-noise ratio and therefore, potentially lower spatial resolution or longer scan times.
  This chapter examines the challenges and opportunities of low-field and ultra-low-field MRI, with a focus on the role of machine learning (ML) in overcoming these limitations. We provide an overview of deep neural networks and their application in enhancing low-field and ultra-low-field MRI performance. Specific ML-based solutions, including advanced image reconstruction, denoising, and super-resolution algorithms, are discussed. The chapter concludes by exploring how integrating ML with low-field MRI could expand its clinical applications and improve accessibility, potentially revolutionizing its use in diverse healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy image-to-image translation: evaluating uncertainty calibration in unpaired training scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mammographic screening is an effective method for detecting breast cancer, facilitating early diagnosis. However, the current need to manually inspect images places a heavy burden on healthcare systems, spurring a desire for automated diagnostic protocols. Techniques based on deep neural networks have been shown effective in some studies, but their tendency to overfit leaves considerable risk for poor generalisation and misdiagnosis, preventing their widespread adoption in clinical settings. Data augmentation schemes based on unpaired neural style transfer models have been proposed that improve generalisability by diversifying the representations of training image features in the absence of paired training data (images of the same tissue in either image style). But these models are similarly prone to various pathologies, and evaluating their performance is challenging without ground truths/large datasets (as is often the case in medical imaging). Here, we consider two frameworks/architectures: a GAN-based cycleGAN, and the more recently developed diffusion-based SynDiff. We evaluate their performance when trained on image patches parsed from three open access mammography datasets and one non-medical image dataset. We consider the use of uncertainty quantification to assess model trustworthiness, and propose a scheme to evaluate calibration quality in unpaired training scenarios. This ultimately helps facilitate the trustworthy use of image-to-image translation models in domains where ground truths are not typically available.</description>

      <title>Dual Invariance Self-training for Reliable Semi-supervised Surgical Phase Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for advancing computer-assisted interventions, yet the scarcity of labeled data hinders training reliable deep learning models. Semi-supervised learning (SSL), particularly with pseudo-labeling, shows promise over fully supervised methods but often lacks reliable pseudo-label assessment mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose a novel SSL framework, Dual Invariance Self-Training (DIST), that incorporates both Temporal and Transformation Invariance to enhance surgical phase recognition. Our two-step self-training process dynamically selects reliable pseudo-labels, ensuring robust pseudo-supervision. Our approach mitigates the risk of noisy pseudo-labels, steering decision boundaries toward true data distribution and improving generalization to unseen data. Evaluations on Cataract and Cholec80 datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art SSL approaches, consistently surpassing both supervised and SSL baselines across various network architectures.</description>

      <title>PulmoFusion: Advancing Pulmonary Health with Efficient Multi-Modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional remote spirometry lacks the precision required for effective pulmonary monitoring. We present a novel, non-invasive approach using multimodal predictive models that integrate RGB or thermal video data with patient metadata. Our method leverages energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for the regression of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and classification of Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), using lightweight CNNs to overcome SNN limitations in regression tasks. Multimodal data integration is improved with a Multi-Head Attention Layer, and we employ K-Fold validation and ensemble learning to boost robustness. Using thermal data, our SNN models achieve 92% accuracy on a breathing-cycle basis and 99.5% patient-wise. PEF regression models attain Relative RMSEs of 0.11 (thermal) and 0.26 (RGB), with an MAE of 4.52% for FEV1/FVC predictions, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System for Tumor Layered Diagnosis via Multi-task Semi-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. Multimodal MRI is widely used for the preliminary screening of gliomas and plays a crucial role in auxiliary diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, and prognostic evaluation. Currently, the computer-aided diagnostic studies of gliomas using MRI have focused on independent analysis events such as tumor segmentation, grading, and radiogenomic classification, without studying inter-dependencies among these events. In this study, we propose a Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System (GMMAS) that utilizes a deep learning network for processing multiple events simultaneously, leveraging their inter-dependencies through an uncertainty-based multi-task learning architecture and synchronously outputting tumor region segmentation, glioma histological subtype, IDH mutation genotype, and 1p/19q chromosome disorder status. Compared with the reported single-task analysis models, GMMAS improves the precision across tumor layered diagnostic tasks. Additionally, we have employed a two-stage semi-supervised learning method, enhancing model performance by fully exploiting both labeled and unlabeled MRI samples. Further, by utilizing an adaptation module based on knowledge self-distillation and contrastive learning for cross-modal feature extraction, GMMAS exhibited robustness in situations of modality absence and revealed the differing significance of each MRI modal. Finally, based on the analysis outputs of the GMMAS, we created a visual and user-friendly platform for doctors and patients, introducing GMMAS-GPT to generate personalized prognosis evaluations and suggestions.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</description>

      <title>Separated Inter/Intra-Modal Fusion Prompts for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize subtle differences in meaning or the combination of states and objects through the use of known and unknown concepts during training. Existing methods either focused on prompt configuration or on using prompts to tune the pre-trained Vision-Language model. However, these methods faced challenges in accurately identifying subtle differences in meaning or combining states with objects. To jointly eradicate the above issues and construct an efficient and effective CZSL technique, we suggest a method to improve attribute recognition performance by utilizing diverse Prompt Learning with an Inter/Intra-Modality Fusion Synthesizer in scene understanding involving subtle semantic differences and multiple objects.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Unified Framework for Red Lesions Detection on Retinal Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05021v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red-lesions, microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HMs), are the early signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The automatic detection of MAs and HMs on retinal fundus images is a challenging task. Most of the existing methods detect either only MAs or only HMs because of the difference in their texture, sizes, and morphology. Though some methods detect both MAs and HMs, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality of shape and colors features and fail to detect all shape variations of HMs such as flame-shaped. Leveraging the progress in deep learning, we proposed a two-stream red lesions detection system dealing simultaneously with small and large red lesions. For this system, we introduced a new ROIs candidates generation method for large red lesions on fundus images; it is based on blood vessel segmentation and morphological operations, and reduces the computational complexity, and enhances the detection accuracy by generating a small number of potential candidates. For detection, we proposed a framework with two streams. We used pretrained VGGNet as a backbone model and carried out several extensive experiments to tune it for vessels segmentation and candidates generation, and finally learning the appropriate mapping, which yields better detection of the red lesions comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results validated the effectiveness of the system in the detection of both MAs and HMs; it yields higher performance for per lesion detection; its sensitivity equals 0.8589 and good FROC score under 8 FPIs on DiaretDB1-MA reports FROC=0.7518, and with SN=0.7552 and good FROC score under 2,4and 8 FPIs on DiaretDB1-HM, and SN=0.8157 on e-ophtha with overall FROC=0.4537 and on ROCh dataset with FROC=0.3461 which is higher than the state-of-the art methods. For DR screening, the system performs well with good AUC on DiaretDB1-MA, DiaretDB1-HM, and e-ophtha datasets.</description>

      <title>ELFATT: Efficient Linear Fast Attention for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attention mechanism is the key to the success of transformers in different machine learning tasks. However, the quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length of the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism becomes the major bottleneck for the application of long sequence tasks, such as vision tasks. Although various efficient linear attention mechanisms have been proposed, they need to sacrifice performance to achieve high efficiency. What's more, memory-efficient methods, such as FlashAttention-1-3, still have quadratic computation complexity which can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient linear fast attention (ELFATT) mechanism to achieve low memory input/output operations, linear computational complexity, and high performance at the same time. ELFATT offers 4-7x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism in high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. ELFATT is FlashAttention friendly. Using FlashAttention-2 acceleration, ELFATT still offers 2-3x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism on high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. Even on edge GPUs, ELFATT still offers 1.6x to 2.0x speedups compared to state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in various power modes from 5W to 60W. Furthermore, ELFATT can be used to enhance and accelerate diffusion tasks directly without training.</description>

      <title>Temporal Brightness Management for Immersive Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern virtual reality headsets demand significant computational resources to render high-resolution content in real-time. Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.</description>

      <title>Neural variational Data Assimilation with Uncertainty Quantification using SPDE priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatio-temporal interpolation of large geophysical datasets has historically been addressed by Optimal Interpolation (OI) and more sophisticated equation-based or data-driven Data Assimilation (DA) techniques. Recent advances in the deep learning community enables to address the interpolation problem through a neural architecture incorporating a variational data assimilation framework. The reconstruction task is seen as a joint learning problem of the prior involved in the variational inner cost, seen as a projection operator of the state, and the gradient-based minimization of the latter. Both prior models and solvers are stated as neural networks with automatic differentiation which can be trained by minimizing a loss function, typically the mean squared error between some ground truth and the reconstruction. Such a strategy turns out to be very efficient to improve the mean state estimation, but still needs complementary developments to quantify its related uncertainty. In this work, we use the theory of Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) and Gaussian Processes (GP) to estimate both space-and time-varying covariance of the state. Our neural variational scheme is modified to embed an augmented state formulation with both state and SPDE parametrization to estimate. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework on a spatio-temporal GP driven by diffusion-based anisotropies and on realistic Sea Surface Height (SSH) datasets. We show how our solution reaches the OI baseline in the Gaussian case. For nonlinear dynamics, as almost always stated in DA, our solution outperforms OI, while allowing for fast and interpretable online parameter estimation.</description>
