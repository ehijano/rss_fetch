      <title>Learning-Based WiFi Fingerprint Inpainting via Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based indoor positioning has been extensively studied. A fundamental issue in such solutions is the collection of WiFi fingerprints. However, due to real-world constraints, collecting complete fingerprints at all intended locations is sometimes prohibited. This work considers the WiFi fingerprint inpainting problem. This problem differs from typical image/video inpainting problems in several aspects. Unlike RGB images, WiFi field maps come in any shape, and signal data may follow certain distributions. Therefore, it is difficult to forcefully fit them into a fixed-dimensional matrix, as done with processing images in RGB format. As soon as a map is changed, it also becomes difficult to adapt it to the same model due to scale issues. Furthermore, such models are significantly constrained in situations requiring outward inpainting. Fortunately, the spatial relationships of WiFi signals and the rich information provided among channels offer ample opportunities for this generative model to accomplish inpainting. Therefore, we designed this model to not only retain the characteristic of regression models in generating fingerprints of arbitrary shapes but also to accommodate the observational outcomes from densely deployed APs. This work makes two major contributions. Firstly, we delineate the distinctions between this problem and image inpainting, highlighting potential avenues for research. Secondly, we introduce novel generative inpainting models aimed at capturing both inter-AP and intra-AP correlations while preserving latent information. Additionally, we incorporate a specially designed adversarial discriminator to enhance the quality of inpainting outcomes.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Confidence Regions in Sparse MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising solutions for uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional statistics is the debiased LASSO that relies on unconstrained $\ell_1$-minimization. The initial works focused on real Gaussian designs as a toy model for this problem. However, in medical imaging applications, such as compressive sensing for MRI, the measurement system is represented by a (subsampled) complex Fourier matrix. The purpose of this work is to extend the method to the MRI case in order to construct confidence intervals for each pixel of an MR image. We show that a sufficient amount of data is $n \gtrsim \max\{ s_0\log^2 s_0\log p, s_0 \log^2 p \}$.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Antenna Enhanced ISAC: Joint Antenna Positioning and Dual-Functional Beamforming Design under Perfect and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as an essential technique for overcoming spectrum congestion. However, the performance of traditional ISAC systems with fixed-position-antennas (FPA) is limited due to insufficient spatial degree of freedom (DoF) exploration. Recently, fluid antenna (FA) with reconfigurable antenna position is developed to enhance the sensing and communication performance by reshaping the channel. This paper investigates an FA-enhanced ISAC system where a base station is equipped with multiple FAs to communicate with multiple single-antenna users and with FPAs to sense a point target. In this paper, we consider both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the communication channel and sensing channel. In two cases, we focus on the maximization of the sensing signal-to-noise (SNR) by optimizing the positions of FAs and the dual-functional beamforming under the constraints of the FA moving region, the minimum FA distance and the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) per user. Specifically, for the ideal case of perfect CSI, an iterative alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to tackle the formulated problem where the dual-functional beamforming and the FA positions are obtained via semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Then, for the imperfect CSI case, we propose an AO-based iterative algorithm where $\mathcal{S}-$Procedure and SCA are applied to obtain the dual-functional beamforming and the FA positions. Furthermore, we analytically and numerically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate the notable gains of the proposed algorithms in the respective cases.</description>

      <title>Propeller Modulation Equalization via Reference Tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propeller modulation, also known as micro-Doppler modulation, presents a significant challenge in radio frequency (RF) inspection operations conducted via drones. This paper investigates the equalization of propeller modulation effects on RF signals, specifically targeting applications in navigation aids such as Instrument Landing Systems (ILS). By employing a continuous reference tone, the propeller-induced Doppler spread can be effectively captured and equalized, improving signal integrity and accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed equalization method significantly reduces DDM deviation caused by propeller modulation, even under various propeller speeds. The findings suggest that incorporating such equalization techniques can enhance the reliability and efficiency of drone-based RF inspections.</description>

      <title>OFDM-Based Positioning with Unknown Data Payloads: Bounds and Applications to LEO PNT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents bounds, estimators, and signal design strategies for exploiting both known pilot resources and unknown data payload resources in time-of-arrival (TOA)-based positioning systems with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. It is the first to derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) on TOA estimation for OFDM signals containing both known pilot and unknown data resources. In comparison to the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) derived in prior work, this ZZB captures the low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholding effects in TOA estimation and accounts for an unknown carrier phase. The derived ZZB is evaluated against CRBs and empirical TOA error variances. It is then evaluated on signals with resource allocations optimized for pilot-only TOA estimation, quantifying the performance gain over the best-case pilot-only signal designs. Finally, the positioning accuracy of maximum-likelihood and decision-directed estimators is evaluated on simulated low-Earth-orbit non-terrestrial-network channels and compared against their respective ZZBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved compact model for TeraFETs employing a nonlinear transmission line approach to describe the non-uniform carrier density oscillations and electron inertia effects in the TeraFET channels. By calculating the equivalent components for each segment of the channel: conductance, capacitance, and inductance, based on the voltages at the segment's nodes, our model accommodates non-uniform variations along the channel. We validate the efficacy of this approach by comparing terahertz (THz) response simulations with experimental data and MOSA1, EKV TeraFET SPICE models, analytical theories, and Multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>Guiding Wireless Signals with Arrays of Metallic Linear Fresnel Reflectors: A Low-cost, Frequency-versatile, and Practical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mechanical metallic reflector array to guide wireless signals to the point of interest, thereby enhancing received signal quality. Comprised of numerous individual units, this device, which acts as a linear Fresnel reflector (LFR), facilitates the reflection of incoming signals to a desired location. Leveraging geometric principles, we present a systematic approach for redirecting beams from an Access Point (AP) toward User Equipment (UE) positions. This methodology is geared towards optimizing beam allocation, thereby maximizing the number of beams directed towards the UE. Ray tracing simulations conducted for two 3D wireless communication scenarios demonstrate significant increases in path gains and received signal strengths (RSS) by at least 50dB with strategically positioned devices.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Target Location Distribution in MIMO Radar: PCRB vs. PSBP for Waveform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the issue of how to exploit target location distribution for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar waveform design. We consider a MIMO radar aiming to estimate the unknown and random angular location parameters of a point target, whose distribution information can be exploited by the radar. First, we establish the models of the MIMO radar system and the target location distribution. Based on the considered models, we propose the first category of target location distribution exploitation methods by analyzing the radar direction-of-angle (DoA) estimation performance and deriving a general form of posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) as the lower bound of the mean square error of DoA estimation. Following this, to explore more insights, we proposed the second category of target location distribution exploitation methods by introducing a novel radar metric, probability scaled beampattern (PSBP), from the perspective of radar beampattern. To compare the two methods, we formulate the PCRB and PSBP oriented radar waveform design problems and propose corresponding low-complexity and convergence-guaranteed algorithms to tackle them. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in different scenarios to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the radar performance.</description>

      <title>B-ISAC: Backscatter Integrated Sensing and Communication for 6G IoE Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of backscatter communication (BackCom) technology with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology not only enhances the system sensing performance, but also enables low-power information transmission. This is expected to provide a new paradigm for communication and sensing in internet of everything (IoE) applications. Existing works only consider sensing rate and detection performance, while none consider the estimation performance. The design of the system in different task modes also needs to be further studied. In this paper, we propose a novel system called backscatter-ISAC (B-ISAC) and design a joint beamforming framework for different stages (task modes). We derive communication performance metrics of the system in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and communication rate, and derive sensing performance metrics of the system in terms of probability of detection, estimation error of linear least squares (LS) estimation, and the estimation error of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation. The proposed joint beamforming framework consists of three stages: tag detection, tag estimation, and communication enhancement. We develop corresponding joint beamforming schemes aimed at enhancing the performance objectives of their respective stages by solving complex non-convex optimization problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint beamforming schemes. The proposed B-ISAC system has broad application prospect in sixth generation (6G) IoE scenarios.</description>

      <title>Innovative RIS Prototyping Enhancing Wireless Communication with Real-Time Spot Beam Tracking and OAM Wavefront Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sophisticated reconfigurable metasurface architecture that introduces an advanced concept of flexible full-array space-time wavefront manipulation with enhanced dynamic capabilities. The practical 2-bit phase-shifting unit cell on the RIS is distinguished by its ability to maintain four stable phase states, each with ${90^ \circ }$ differences, and features an insertion loss of less than 0.6 dB across a bandwidth of 200 MHz. All reconfigurable units are equipped with meticulously designed control circuits, governed by an intelligent core composed of multiple Micro-Controller Units (MCUs), enabling rapid control response across the entire RIS array. Owing to the capability of each unit cell on the metasurface to independently switch states, the entire RIS is not limited to controlling general beams with specific directional patterns, but also generates beams with more complex structures, including multi-focus 3D spot beams and vortex beams. This development substantially broadens its applicability across various industrial wireless transmission scenarios. Moreover, by leveraging the rapid-respond space-time coding and the full-array independent programmability of the RIS prototyping operating at 10.7 GHz, we have demonstrated that: 1) The implementation of 3D spot beams scanning facilitates dynamic beam tracking and real-time communication under the indoor near-field scenario; 2) The rapid wavefront rotation of vortex beams enables precise modulation of signals within the Doppler domain, showcasing an innovative approach to wireless signal manipulation; 3) The beam steering experiments for blocking users under outdoor far-field scenarios, verifying the beamforming capability of the RIS board.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum Analysis of Vector OFDM Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector OFDM (VOFDM) is equivalent to OTFS and is good for time-varying channels. However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear as that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum of discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of information symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly distributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of information symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size of the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the 0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the linear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so that any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to that of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for various applications, including autonomous vehicles and next-generation wireless networks. However, the reliability and precision of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), are compromised by multi-path errors and non-line-of-sight scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance GPS accuracy by combining visual data from RGB cameras with wireless signals captured at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) basestations. We propose a sensing-aided framework for (i) site-specific GPS data characterization and (ii) GPS position de-noising that utilizes multi-modal visual and wireless information. Our approach is validated in a realistic Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) scenario using a comprehensive real-world dataset, demonstrating a substantial reduction in localization error to sub-meter levels. This method represents a significant advancement in achieving precise localization, particularly beneficial for high-mobility applications in 5G and beyond networks.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Localization with an Exact Propagation Model in Presence of Mutual Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing near-field sources considering practical arrays is important in wireless communications. Array-based apertures exhibit mutual coupling between the array elements, which can significantly degrade the performance of the localization method. In this paper, we propose two methods to localize near-field sources by direction of arrival (DOA) and range estimations in the presence of mutual coupling. The first method utilizes a two-dimensional search to estimate DOA and the range of the source. Therefore, it suffers from a high computational load. The second method reduces the two-dimensional search to one-dimensional, thus decreasing the computational complexity while offering similar DOA and range estimation performance. Besides, our second method reduces computational time by over 50% compared to the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with mobile edge computing (MEC) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology in smart farms is pivotal for efficient resource management and enhanced agricultural productivity sustainably. This paper addresses the critical need for optimizing task offloading in secure UAV-assisted smart farm networks, aiming to reduce total delay and energy consumption while maintaining robust security in data communications. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach using a deep double Q-network (DDQN) with an action mask (AM), designed to manage task offloading dynamically and efficiently. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in managing task offloading, highlighting significant improvements in operational efficiency by reducing delay and energy consumption. This aligns with the goal of developing sustainable and energy-efficient solutions for next-generation network infrastructures, making our approach an advanced solution for achieving both performance and sustainability in smart farming applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of local maximum likelihood (LML) detectors and the family of likelihood ascent search (LAS) detectors are successfully applied to symbol detection in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications and demonstrate performance approaching the NP-hard global maximum likelihood (GML) detector. The LML and LAS detectors in the two families are akin to each other and possess common properties significant in both theory and practical MIMO communications. This book chapter reviews the LML and LAS detectors in a unified framework. The focus is on their formulation, relationships, properties, and GML performance in bit error rate (BER) and spectral efficiency in large MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>RRAM-Based Bio-Inspired Circuits for Mobile Epileptic Correlation Extraction and Seizure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive mobile electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition systems have been utilized for long-term monitoring of seizures, yet they suffer from limited battery life. Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is widely used in computing-in-memory(CIM) systems, which offers an ideal platform for reducing the computational energy consumption of seizure prediction algorithms, potentially solving the endurance issues of mobile EEG systems. To address this challenge, inspired by neuronal mechanisms, we propose a RRAM-based bio-inspired circuit system for correlation feature extraction and seizure prediction. This system achieves a high average sensitivity of 91.2% and a low false positive rate per hour (FPR/h) of 0.11 on the CHB-MIT seizure dataset. The chip under simulation demonstrates an area of approximately 0.83 mm2 and a latency of 62.2 {\mu}s. Power consumption is recorded at 24.4 mW during the feature extraction phase and 19.01 mW in the seizure prediction phase, with a cumulative energy consumption of 1.515 {\mu}J for a 3-second window data processing, predicting 29.2 minutes ahead.

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Active Anti-Jamming in Radio Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM), providing the orthogonality among different OAM modes, has attracted much attention to significantly increase spectrum efficiencies (SEs) and enhance the anti-jamming results of wireless communications. However, the SE of wireless communications is severely degraded under co-frequency and co-mode hostile jamming. Focused on this issue, we propose a novel OAM active anti-jamming scheme to significantly enhance the anti-jamming results of wireless communications under broadband hostile jamming. Specifically, the OAM transmitter with energy detection senses jamming signals to identify which OAM modes are jammed and unjammed. Based on the recognition of OAM modes, useful signals are modulated by reflecting the received co-frequency and co-mode jamming signals with the assistance of a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) to the OAM receiver, thus utilizing both the OAM modes jammed by hostile attacks and the energy of jamming signals. Meanwhile, the unjammed OAM modes allocated with total transmit power are multiplexed for useful signal transmission. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed OAM active anti-jamming scheme can achieve high OAM mode utilization and significantly increase the SEs.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware CSI Tracking and Path Loss Prediction Using Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an advanced model for Channel State Information (CSI) tracking, leveraging a dynamical system approach to adapt CSI dynamically based on exogenous contextual information. This methodology allows for continuous updates to the Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), enhancing communication reliability and responsiveness in dynamic environments. To generate realistic and comprehensive datasets for training and evaluation, we developed a new MATLAB simulator that models radio wave propagation in urban environments. We address the challenge of real-time CKM adaptation using online learning of the Koopman operator, a technique that forecasts channel behaviour by exploiting dynamical system properties. Our approach supports real-time updates with high accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by experiments with varying window sizes for the Koopman Autoencoder model. A window size of 100 was found to offer the best balance between prediction accuracy (RMSE: 1.8323 +- 1.1071, MAE: 0.3780 +- 0.2221) and computational efficiency (training time: 231.1 +- 82.5 ms, prediction time: 109.0 +- 55.7 ms). Additionally, we introduce a moving window mechanism to address privacy and security concerns by updating the Koopman operator within the window and purging input data thereafter, minimising data retention and storage risks. This ensures the CKM remains accurate and relevant while maintaining stringent data privacy standards. Our findings suggest that this approach can significantly improve the resilience and security of communication systems, making them highly adaptable to environmental changes without compromising user privacy.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs in Reliability and Performance Using Selective Beamforming for Ultra-Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimisation challenges in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems, focusing on array selection and beamforming in dynamic and diverse operational contexts. We introduce a novel array selection criterion that incorporates antenna health information into the optimisation process, distinguishing our approach from traditional methods. Our methodology employs dual proximal-gradient ascent to effectively tackle the constrained non-convex and non-smooth nature of sparse array selection problems. A central feature of our strategy is the implementation of proportional fairness among communication users, aligning with system resource limitations while ensuring minimum rate requirements for all users. This approach not only enhances system efficiency and responsiveness but also ensures equitable resource distribution. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in optimising Ultra-Massive MIMO system performance, demonstrating their applicability in complex communication scenarios. Our findings reveal key trade-offs influenced by the sparsity promotion weight ({\gamma}). As {\gamma} increases, spectral efficiency (SE) and communication rate (Ri) decrease, while beamforming matrix density (BMD) reduces and antenna reliability (RL) significantly improves. These results highlight the critical balance between performance and reliability, essential for the practical deployment of Ultra-Massive MIMO systems. This work advances the field by providing innovative solutions and new insights into array selection and beamforming optimization, setting a foundation for future research in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional Graph Linear Canonical Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many multi-dimensional (M-D) graph signals appear in the real world, such as digital images, sensor network measurements and temperature records from weather observation stations. It is a key challenge to design a transform method for processing these graph M-D signals in the linear canonical transform domain. This paper proposes the two-dimensional graph linear canonical transform based on the central discrete dilated Hermite function (2-D CDDHFs-GLCT) and the two-dimensional graph linear canonical transform based on chirp multiplication-chirp convolution-chirp multiplication decomposition (2-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT). Then, extending 2-D CDDHFs-GLCT and 2-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT to M-D CDDHFs-GLCT and M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT. In terms of the computational complexity, additivity and reversibility, M-D CDDHFs-GLCT and M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT are compared. Theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT algorithm is obviously reduced. Simulation results indicate that M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT achieves comparable additivity to M-D CDDHFs-GLCT, while M-D CM-CC-CM-GLCT exhibits better reversibility. Finally, M-D GLCT is applied to data compression to show its application advantages. The experimental results reflect the superiority of M-D GLCT in the algorithm design and implementation of data compression.</description>

      <title>GroupCDL: Interpretable Denoising and Compressed Sensing MRI via Learned Group-Sparsity and Circulant Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal self-similarity within images has become an increasingly popular prior in deep-learning models. Despite their successful image restoration performance, such models remain largely uninterpretable due to their black-box construction. Our previous studies have shown that interpretable construction of a fully convolutional denoiser (CDLNet), with performance on par with state-of-the-art black-box counterparts, is achievable by unrolling a convolutional dictionary learning algorithm. In this manuscript, we seek an interpretable construction of a convolutional network with a nonlocal self-similarity prior that performs on par with black-box nonlocal models. We show that such an architecture can be effectively achieved by upgrading the L1 sparsity prior (soft-thresholding) of CDLNet to an image-adaptive group-sparsity prior (group-thresholding). The proposed learned group-thresholding makes use of nonlocal attention to perform spatially varying soft-thresholding on the latent representation. To enable effective training and inference on large images with global artifacts, we propose a novel circulant-sparse attention. We achieve competitive natural-image denoising performance compared to black-box nonlocal DNNs and transformers. The interpretable construction of our network allows for a straightforward extension to Compressed Sensing MRI (CS-MRI), yielding state-of-the-art performance. Lastly, we show robustness to noise-level mismatches between training and inference for denoising and CS-MRI reconstruction.</description>

Abstract: The inspection of power transmission line has achieved notable achievements in the past few years, primarily due to the integration of deep learning technology. However, current inspection approaches continue to encounter difficulties in generalization and intelligence, which restricts their further applicability. In this paper, we introduce Power-LLaVA, the first large language and vision assistant designed to offer professional and reliable inspection services for power transmission line by engaging in dialogues with humans. Moreover, we also construct a large-scale and high-quality dataset specialized for the inspection task. By employing a two-stage training strategy on the constructed dataset, Power-LLaVA demonstrates exceptional performance at a comparatively low training cost. Extensive experiments further prove the great capabilities of Power-LLaVA within the realm of power transmission line inspection. Code shall be released.</description>

      <title>The Impact of LoRA Adapters for LLMs on Clinical NLP Classification Under Data Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to the domain gap and limited data availability. This study investigates the effectiveness of various adapter techniques, equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for fine-tuning LLMs in a resource-constrained hospital environment. We experimented with four structures-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN)-as final layers for clinical notes classification. We fine-tuned biomedical pre-trained models, including CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, and DrBERT, alongside two Transformer-based models. Our extensive experimental results indicate that i) employing adapter structures does not yield significant improvements in fine-tuning biomedical pre-trained LLMs, and ii) simpler Transformer-based models, trained from scratch, perform better under resource constraints. Among the adapter structures, GRN demonstrated superior performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1 score of 0.88. Moreover, the total training time for LLMs exceeded 1000 hours, compared to under 6 hours for simpler transformer-based models, highlighting that LLMs are more suitable for environments with extensive computational resources and larger datasets. Consequently, this study demonstrates that simpler Transformer-based models can be effectively trained from scratch, providing a viable solution for clinical NLP tasks in low-resource environments with limited data availability. By identifying the GRN as the most effective adapter structure, we offer a practical approach to enhance clinical note classification without requiring extensive computational resources.</description>

      <title>Model-based Super-resolution: Towards a Unified Framework for Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mathematics, a super-resolution problem can be formulated as acquiring high-frequency data from low-frequency measurements. This extrapolation problem in the frequency domain is well-known to be unstable. We propose the model-based super-resolution framework (Model-SR) to address this ill-posedness. Within this framework, we can recover the signal by solving a nonlinear least square problem and achieve the super-resolution. Theoretically, the resolution-enhancing map is proved to have Lipschitz continuity under mild conditions, leading to a stable solution to the super-resolution problem. We apply the general theory to three concrete models and give the stability estimates for each model. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the super-resolution behavior of the proposed framework. The model-based mathematical framework can be extended to problems with similar structures.</description>

Abstract: In this correspondence, we study deploying movable antenna (MA) array in a wideband multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication system, where near-field (NF) channel model is considered. To alleviate beam squint effect, we propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire wideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly challenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the cutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop algorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of utilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology for future wireless communications. In this paper, we consider a downlink monostatic ISAC system wherein the base station serves multiple communications users and sensing targets at the same time in the presence of clutter. We aim at both guaranteeing fairness among the communications users while simultaneously balancing the performances of communications and sensing functionalities. Therefore, we optimize the transmit and receive beamformers to maximize the weighted minimum signal-to-interference and clutter-plus-noise ratios. The design problem is highly challenging due to the non-smooth and non-convex objective function and strongly coupled variables. We propose two efficient methods to solve the problem. First, we rely on fractional programming and transform the original problem into convex sub-problems, which can be solved with standard convex optimization tools. To further reduce the complexity and dependence on numerical tools, we develop a novel approach to address the inherent non-smoothness of the formulated problem. Finally, the efficiencies of the proposed designs are demonstrated by numerical results.</description>

Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources. Forecasting photovoltaic power generation is an important way to increase photovoltaic penetration. However, the task of photovoltaic forecasting is complicated due to its property of uncertainty, especially in specific regions during the foggy winter. This paper proposes a novel model to accomplish the problem. A developed entropy is created to qualify the uncertainty during the foggy winter. The clustering method and modified retention network are applied to reduce complexity and forecast, respectively. We adopt an optimization to optimize the hyperparameters. Results are validated from the multivariate forecasting model using the dataset from a photovoltaic power station in Jiangsu Province, China. Experiments show that the proposed model improves the forecasting accuracy compared to various models during the foggy winter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to provide wireless services for wide sea area, this paper designs an integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime communication framework. Specifically, the terrestrial base station (TBS) serves near-shore users, while the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communicates with off-shore users. We aim to improve the overall performance of integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime communication system. Thus, it makes sense to jointly optimize transmit beamforming at the TBS and LEO satellite. Due to sea wave fluctuation, the obtained channel state information (CSI) is often imperfect. In this context, a robust beamforming design algorithm is proposed with the goal of minimizing the total power consumption of integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime communication system while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed algorithm in maritime communications.</description>

      <title>Sensor Selection via GFlowNets: A Deep Generative Modeling Framework to Navigate Combinatorial Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of sensor arrays in sensing and wireless communications improves with more elements, but this comes at the cost of increased energy consumption and hardware expense. This work addresses the challenge of selecting $k$ sensor elements from a set of $m$ to optimize a generic Quality-of-Service metric. Evaluating all $\binom{m}{k}$ possible sensor subsets is impractical, leading to prior solutions using convex relaxations, greedy algorithms, and supervised learning approaches. The current paper proposes a new framework that employs deep generative modeling, treating sensor selection as a deterministic Markov Decision Process where sensor subsets of size $k$ arise as terminal states. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are employed to model an action distribution conditioned on the state. Sampling actions from the aforementioned distribution ensures that the probability of arriving at a terminal state is proportional to the performance of the corresponding subset. Applied to a standard sensor selection scenario, the developed approach outperforms popular methods which are based on convex optimization and greedy algorithms. Finally, a multiobjective formulation of the proposed approach is adopted and applied on the sparse antenna array design for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. The multiobjective variation is shown to perform well in managing the trade-off between radar and communication performance.</description>

      <title>PredIN: Towards Open-Set Gesture Recognition via Prediction Inconsistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gesture recognition based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has achieved significant progress in human-machine interaction (HMI). However, accurately recognizing predefined gestures within a closed set is still inadequate in practice; a robust open-set system needs to effectively reject unknown gestures while correctly classifying known ones. To handle this challenge, we first report prediction inconsistency discovered for unknown classes due to ensemble diversity, which can significantly facilitate the detection of unknown classes. Based on this insight, we propose an ensemble learning approach, PredIN, to explicitly magnify the prediction inconsistency by enhancing ensemble diversity. Specifically, PredIN maximizes the class feature distribution inconsistency among ensemble members to enhance diversity. Meanwhile, it optimizes inter-class separability within an individual ensemble member to maintain individual performance. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the PredIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.Our proposed method simultaneously achieves accurate closed-set classification for predefined gestures and effective rejection for unknown gestures, exhibiting its efficacy and superiority in open-set gesture recognition based on sEMG.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Transform Enhancement through Envelope Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world networks are characterized by directionality; however, the absence of an appropriate Fourier basis hinders the effective implementation of graph signal processing techniques.
  Inspired by discrete signal processing, where embedding a line digraph into a cycle digraph facilitates the powerful Discrete Fourier Transform for signal analysis, addressing the structural complexities of general digraphs can help overcome the limitations of the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and unlock its potential.
  The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) serves as a Graph Fourier Transform for both cycle graphs and Cayley digraphs on the finite cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$. We propose a systematic method to identify a class of such Cayley digraphs that can encompass a given directed graph. By embedding the directed graph into these Cayley digraphs and opting for envelope extensions that naturally support the Graph Fourier Transform, the GFT functionalities of these extensions can be harnessed for signal analysis.
  Among the potential envelopes, optimal performance is achieved by selecting one that meets key properties. This envelope's structure closely aligns with the characteristics of the original digraph. The Graph Fourier Transform of this envelope is reliable in terms of numerical stability, and its columns approximately form an eigenbasis for the adjacency matrix associated with the original digraph.
  It is shown that the envelope extensions possess a convolution product, with their GFT fulfilling the convolution theorem. Additionally, shift-invariant graph filters (systems) are described as the convolution operator, analogous to the classical case. This allows the utilization of systems for signal analysis.</description>

Abstract: Current research in synthesized speech detection primarily focuses on the generalization of detection systems to unknown spoofing methods of noise-free speech. However, the performance of anti-spoofing countermeasures (CM) system is often don't work as well in more challenging scenarios, such as those involving noise and reverberation. To address the problem of enhancing the robustness of CM systems, we propose a transfer learning-based speech enhancement front-end joint optimization (TL-SEJ) method, investigating its effectiveness in improving robustness against noise and reverberation. We evaluated the proposed method's performance through a series of comparative and ablation experiments. The experimental results show that, across different signal-to-noise ratio test conditions, the proposed TL-SEJ method improves recognition accuracy by 2.7% to 15.8% compared to the baseline. Compared to conventional data augmentation methods, our system achieves an accuracy improvement ranging from 0.7% to 5.8% in various noisy conditions and from 1.7% to 2.8% under different RT60 reverberation scenarios. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances system robustness in noisy and reverberant conditions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Unsupervised Graph Wavelet Autoencoder for Mechanical System Fault Detection</title>

Abstract: Reliable fault detection is an essential requirement for safe and efficient operation of complex mechanical systems in various industrial applications. Despite the abundance of existing approaches and the maturity of the fault detection research field, the interdependencies between condition monitoring data have often been overlooked. Recently, graph neural networks have been proposed as a solution for learning the interdependencies among data, and the graph autoencoder (GAE) architecture, similar to standard autoencoders, has gained widespread use in fault detection. However, both the GAE and the graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) have fixed receptive fields, limiting their ability to extract multiscale features and model performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose two graph neural network models: the graph wavelet autoencoder (GWAE), and the graph wavelet variational autoencoder (GWVAE). GWAE consists mainly of the spectral graph wavelet convolutional (SGWConv) encoder and a feature decoder, while GWVAE is the variational form of GWAE. The developed SGWConv is built upon the spectral graph wavelet transform which can realize multiscale feature extraction by decomposing the graph signal into one scaling function coefficient and several spectral graph wavelet coefficients. To achieve unsupervised mechanical system fault detection, we transform the collected system signals into PathGraph by considering the neighboring relationships of each data sample. Fault detection is then achieved by evaluating the reconstruction errors of normal and abnormal samples. We carried out experiments on two condition monitoring datasets collected from fuel control systems and one acoustic monitoring dataset from a valve. The results show that the proposed methods improve the performance by around 3%~4% compared to the comparison methods.</description>

      <title>The beltway problem over orthogonal groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical beltway problem entails recovering a set of points from their unordered pairwise distances on the circle. This problem can be viewed as a special case of the crystallographic phase retrieval problem of recovering a sparse signal from its periodic autocorrelation. Based on this interpretation, and motivated by cryo-electron microscopy, we suggest a natural generalization to orthogonal groups: recovering a sparse signal, up to an orthogonal transformation, from its autocorrelation over the orthogonal group. If the support of the signal is collision-free, we bound the number of solutions to the beltway problem over orthogonal groups, and prove that this bound is exactly one when the support of the signal is radially collision-free (i.e., the support points have distinct magnitudes). We also prove that if the pairwise products of the signal's weights are distinct, then the autocorrelation determines the signal uniquely, up to an orthogonal transformation. We conclude the paper by considering binary signals and show that in this case, the collision-free condition need not be sufficient to determine signals up to orthogonal transformation.</description>

      <title>RadioGAT: A Joint Model-based and Data-driven Framework for Multi-band Radiomap Reconstruction via Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-band radiomap reconstruction (MB-RMR) is a key component in wireless communications for tasks such as spectrum management and network planning. However, traditional machine-learning-based MB-RMR methods, which rely heavily on simulated data or complete structured ground truth, face significant deployment challenges. These challenges stem from the differences between simulated and actual data, as well as the scarcity of real-world measurements. To address these challenges, our study presents RadioGAT, a novel framework based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) tailored for MB-RMR within a single area, eliminating the need for multi-region datasets. RadioGAT innovatively merges model-based spatial-spectral correlation encoding with data-driven radiomap generalization, thus minimizing the reliance on extensive data sources. The framework begins by transforming sparse multi-band data into a graph structure through an innovative encoding strategy that leverages radio propagation models to capture the spatial-spectral correlation inherent in the data. This graph-based representation not only simplifies data handling but also enables tailored label sampling during training, significantly enhancing the framework's adaptability for deployment. Subsequently, The GAT is employed to generalize the radiomap information across various frequency bands. Extensive experiments using raytracing datasets based on real-world environments have demonstrated RadioGAT's enhanced accuracy in supervised learning settings and its robustness in semi-supervised scenarios. These results underscore RadioGAT's effectiveness and practicality for MB-RMR in environments with limited data availability.</description>

      <title>Learning Global and Local Features of Power Load Series Through Transformer and 2D-CNN: An Image-based Multi-step Forecasting Approach Incorporating Phase Space Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As modern power systems continue to evolve, accurate power load forecasting remains a critical issue in energy management. The phase space reconstruction method can effectively retain the inner chaotic property of power load from a system dynamics perspective and thus is a promising knowledge-based preprocessing method for short-term forecasting. In order to fully utilize the capability of PSR method to model the non-stationary characteristics within power load, and to solve the problem of the difficulty in applying traditional PSR prediction methods to form a general multi-step forecasting scheme, this study proposes a novel multi-step forecasting approach by delicately integrating the PSR with neural networks to establish an end-to-end learning system. Firstly, the useful features in the phase trajectory are discussed in detail. Through mathematical derivation, the equivalent characterization of the PSR and another time series preprocessing method, patch segmentation, is demonstrated for the first time. Based on this knowledge, an image-based modeling perspective is introduced. Subsequently, a novel deep learning model, namely PSR-GALIEN, is designed, in which the Transformer Encoder and 2D-CNN are employed for the extraction of the global and local patterns in the image, and a MLP-based predictor is used for the efficient correlation modeling. Then, extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the PSR-GALIEN. The results show that, compared with six state-of-the-art deep learning models, the forecasting performance of PSR-GALIEN consistently surpasses these baselines, achieving superior accuracy in both intra-day and day-ahead forecasting scenarios. At the same time, the attributions of its forecasting results can be explained through the visualization-based method, which significantly increases the interpretability.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Convex Optimization: A Contraction and Equilibrium Tracking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a novel and broadly-applicable contraction-theoretic approach to continuous-time time-varying convex optimization. For any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics, we show that the tracking error is asymptotically proportional to the rate of change of the parameter with proportionality constant upper bounded by Lipschitz constant in which the parameter appears divided by the contraction rate of the dynamics squared. We additionally establish that any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics can be augmented with a feedforward prediction term to ensure that the tracking error converges to zero exponentially quickly. To apply these results to time-varying convex optimization problems, we establish the strong infinitesimal contractivity of dynamics solving three canonical problems, namely monotone inclusions, linear equality-constrained problems, and composite minimization problems. For each of these problems, we prove the sharpest-known rates of contraction and provide explicit tracking error bounds between solution trajectories and minimizing trajectories. We validate our theoretical results on three numerical examples including an application to control-barrier function based controller design.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided MIMO Systems: A Partially Decoupled Atomic Norm Minimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Channel estimation (CE) plays a key role in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, while it poses a challenging task due to the passive nature of RIS and the cascaded channel structures. In this paper, a partially decoupled atomic norm minimization (PDANM) framework is proposed for CE of RIS-aided MIMO systems, which exploits the three-dimensional angular sparsity of the channel. In particular, PDANM partially decouples the differential angles at the RIS from other angles at the base station and user equipment, reducing the computational complexity compared with existing methods. A reweighted PDANM (RPDANM) algorithm is proposed to further improve CE accuracy, which iteratively refines CE through a specifically designed reweighing strategy. Building upon RPDANM, we propose an iterative approach named RPDANM with adaptive phase control (RPDANM-APC), which adaptively adjusts the RIS phases based on previously estimated channel parameters to facilitate CE, achieving superior CE accuracy while reducing training overhead. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches in terms of running time, CE accuracy, and training overhead. In particular, the RPDANM-APC approach can achieve higher CE accuracy than existing methods within less than 30 percent training overhead while reducing the running time by tens of times.</description>

      <title>Design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces by Using S-Parameter Multiport Network Theory -- Optimization and Full-Wave Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiport network theory has been proved to be a suitable abstraction model for analyzing and optimizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an electromagnetically consistent manner, especially for studying the impact of the electromagnetic mutual coupling among radiating elements that are spaced less than half of the wavelength apart and for considering the interrelation between the amplitude and phase of the reflection coefficients. Both representations in terms of Z-parameter (impedance) and S-parameter (scattering) matrices are widely utilized. In this paper, we embrace multiport network theory for analyzing and optimizing the reradiation properties of RIS-aided channels, and provide four new contributions. (i) We offer a thorough comparison between the Z-parameter and S-parameter representations. This comparison allows us to unveil that typical scattering models utilized for RIS-aided channels ignore the structural scattering from an RIS, which is well documented in antenna theory. We show that the structural scattering results in an unwanted specular reflection. (ii) We develop an iterative algorithm for optimizing, in the presence of electromagnetic mutual coupling, the tunable loads of an RIS based on the S-parameters representation. We prove that small perturbations of the step size of the algorithm result in larger variations of the S-parameter matrix compared with the Z-parameter matrix, resulting in a faster convergence rate. (iii) We generalize the proposed algorithm to suppress the specular reflection due to the structural scattering, while maximizing the received power towards the direction of interest, and analyze the effectiveness and tradeoffs of the proposed approach. (iv) We validate the theoretical findings and algorithms with numerical simulations and a commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulator based on the method of moments.</description>

      <title>Unified Capacity Results for Free-Space Optical Communication Systems Over Gamma-Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmit power control, as in the mobile wireless channels, can enable a robust and spectrally efficient communication through atmospheric turbulence in terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) channels. With optical bandwidths in excess of several GHz and eye safety regulations limiting the transmit optical power, the per hertz signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terrestrial FSO systems can possibly become limited, especially true for future high-bandwidth and long-haul applications. Hence, power control becomes significant in terrestrial FSO systems. However, a comprehensive study of dynamic power adaptation in the existing FSO systems is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we investigate FSO communication systems capable of beam power control with heterodyne detection and direct detection based receivers operating under shot noise-limited conditions. Under these considerations, we derive unified exact and asymptotic capacity formulas for the Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels with and without pointing errors; these novel closed-form capacity expressions provide new insights into the impact of varying turbulence conditions and pointing errors. Further, the numerical results highlight the intricate relations of atmospheric turbulence and pointing error parameters in typical terrestrial FSO channel setting. A concrete assessment of the impact of the key channel parameters on the capacity performances of the aforementioned FSO systems is performed revealing several novel and interesting insights.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming with Gradient-based Liquid Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication with the advanced beamforming technologies is a key enabler to meet the growing demands of future mobile communication. However, the dynamic nature of cellular channels in large-scale urban mmWave MIMO communication scenarios brings substantial challenges, particularly in terms of complexity and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a robust gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) framework that utilizes ordinary differential equation-based liquid neurons to solve the beamforming problem. Specifically, our proposed GLNN framework takes gradients of the optimization objective function as inputs to extract the high-order channel feature information, and then introduces a residual connection to mitigate the training burden. Furthermore, we use the manifold learning technique to compress the search space of the beamforming problem. These designs enable the GLNN to effectively maintain low complexity while ensuring strong robustness to noisy and highly dynamic channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the GLNN can achieve 4.15% higher spectral efficiency than that of typical iterative algorithms, and reduce the time consumption to only 1.61% that of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

      <title>Surpassing Cosine Similarity for Multidimensional Comparisons: Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement in computational power and hardware efficiency enabled the tackling of increasingly complex and high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) achieved remarkable results, the interpretability of high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, which is essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), or k-means clustering. Common metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance are often used for such comparisons - for example in muscular synergies of the human motor control system. However, their applicability and interpretability diminish as dimensionality increases. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of dimensionality on these metrics. Our results reveal significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimensionality of the vectors, leading to biased and less interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce the Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM) which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) in Low Altitude Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of utilizing Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) technology in Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), with a particular focus on aerial access networks. We consider an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based wireless network comprised of two layers of UAVs: (a) a lower layer consisting a number of flying users and a UAV Base Station (BS) that provides coverage for terrestrial users and, (b) an upper layer designated to provide both wireless access for flying users and backhaul connectivity for UAV BS. By adopting IAB technology, the backhaul and access links collaboratively share their resources, enabling aerial backhauling and the utilization of the same infrastructure and frequency resources for access links. A sum-rate maximization problem is formulated by considering aerial backhaul constraints to optimally allocate the frequency spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. We decompose the resulting non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems of beamforming and spectrum allocation and then propose efficient solutions for each. Numerical results in different scenarios yield insightful findings about the effectiveness of using the IAB technique in aerial networks.</description>
