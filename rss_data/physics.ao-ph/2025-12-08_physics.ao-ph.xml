      <title>The Great Oxidation Event (GOE): Biogeochemical Feedback and Tipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximately 1.4 Ga after life first appeared, atmospheric oxygen suddenly jumped by more than an order of magnitude over a 20-50 Ma period. The contrast between these two timescales does not seem to be due to any sudden, large amplitude change in external forcing. However, it could be due to processes intrinsic to the geobiological system itself, namely, positive feedback between atmospheric oxygen and photosynthetic bacteria: More oxygen leads to more photosynthesis, which leads to more oxygen, and so on. Already-published feedbacks include buildup of an ozone shield and nutrient production by oxidative weathering. The feedback proposed here is the 15-fold greater efficiency of aerobic vs anaerobic respiration and the tight coupling of respiration and photosynthesis inside the cell. As in the climate system, feedback leads to tipping points, where a rapid, large amplitude change in the state of the system occurs. For the geobiological system, the GOE is the tipping point, and the long buildup before the GOE is the gradual oxidation of the crust and ocean, due either to burial of organic matter, oxidation of volcanic gases, or escape of hydrogen to space. The feedback hypothesis is a framework for interpreting observations leading to the GOE.</description>

      <title>China Regional 3km Downscaling Based on Residual Corrective Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in numerical weather prediction is to efficiently produce high-resolution forecasts. A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively mapping the Eady model onto a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-layer quasigeostrophic model (2LQG) and the Eady model are two idealized systems illustrating the baroclinic instability of atmospheric jets and ocean currents. The two setups share many ingredients -- background vertically sheared zonal flow of density-stratified fluid in a rapidly rotating frame -- while differing in complexity and dimensionality. The Eady model has a continuous vertical direction, with baroclinic turbulence induced by boundary potential vorticity (PV) gradients at top and bottom. By contrast, the 2LQG sytem typically models baroclinic instability induced by interior PV gradients. This distinction challenges our ability to clearly identify a couple of 'modes' through which the Eady dynamics could be inferred from a simpler 2LQG system. In the present study, we show that this difficulty can be circumvented in the turbulent regime arising for weak bottom drag. Namely, guided by the common organization of both systems into a gas of coherent vortices, we identify a quantitative mapping between the Eady and the 2LQG models. The mapping allows for parameter-free predictions of the eddy diffusivity of the Eady model based on the knowledge of the 2LQG diffusivity. We illustrate these results using numerical simulations of the Eady and 2LQG models with linear or quadratic bottom drag.</description>

      <title>The absolute seawater entropy: Part I. Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absolute entropy of seawater is defined as an improved version of the relationship defined by Franck Millero in 1976 and 1983. The first improvements concern the complex non-linear dependence of entropy on pressure, temperature and salinity, with the use of the standard TEOS10 formulation based on a fit of the oceanic Gibbs function to more recent observations. On the other hand, more recent thermodynamic tables have been used to increase the accuracy of the Millero's salinity increment to this standard formulation, to deduce the absolute version of entropy with new values for the pure-water and sea-salts absolute reference entropies. The differences between the values of the seawater entropy calculated with the Millero and TEOS10 formulations (standard and absolute) are documented, before a more complete study shown in the second part of the paper of the absolute seawater entropy computed from observed vertical profiles and analysed surface datasets.</description>

      <title>The absolute seawater entropy: Part II. Case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this second part of the article is to study with several concrete cases the absolute definition of the seawater entropy described in Part I. Observed vertical profiles and polar transects, as well as analysed surface data, show that very different temperature and salinity values can organise to create new isentropic regions that can only be revealed by the absolute formulation of the entropy of seawater (Arctic Ocean; Bay of Bengal; Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas). Existing hypotheses to explain these results include the possible impact of turbulent processes that must be applied to the entropies of the atmosphere and oceans.</description>

      <title>Climate impacts of equatorial superrotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is expected that the large-scale tropical circulation should undergo some changes in a warmer climate, it remains an open question whether its characteristic features, such as the Hadley cell, the intertropical convergence zone, or the weak surface easterlies, could take a completely different shape. As an example, it has been hypothesized that the Earth's atmosphere may have experienced equatorial superrotation -- i.e. westerly winds at the equator -- during its history. The possibility of equatorial superrotation has been studied in a range of planetary atmospheres, including Earth-like ones, with the objective of understanding the underlying dynamical processes. However, the broader impact that this dramatic circulation change would have on the climate system is practically unexplored. This is the question we address here. We perform idealized GCM simulations with an imposed equatorial torque to investigate how a forced superrotating atmosphere affects surface temperature and the water cycle. We show that these effects are quite large and directly related to the global circulation changes, which extend beyond the tropical atmosphere. Using tools including a forcing/feedback analysis and a moist energy balance model, we argue that the dominant mechanism is changes in atmospheric energy transport, driven in particular by the collapse of the meridional overturning circulation, and to a smaller extent by the appearance of an equatorial jet, and the concomitant redistribution of moisture in the tropics, leading to a much weaker relative humidity gradient which has strong radiative effects.</description>
