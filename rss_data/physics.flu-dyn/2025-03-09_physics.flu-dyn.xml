      <title>Design of a test rig for the investigation of falling film flows with counter-current gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geothermal phase change probes operate on the principle of falling film evaporation, enabling the efficient use of geothermal heat for space heating applications. Despite successful applications in research, their commercial use is limited. One of the primary reasons for this is the absence of validated models capable of accurately representing the falling film flow coupled with counter-current gas flow within these probes. For this reason, a test rig has been developed to facilitate the validation of future models. This test rig allows for the replication of flow phenomena appearing within geothermal probes under controlled conditions. The test rig was successfully tested within the first measurement campaign presented in this paper. Within the framework of this measurement campaign water was used as liquid due to its similar Kapitza number compared to \(CO_{2}\), typically used within geothermal probes, and humid air as gas. For the gas phase, velocity profiles were measured and for the liquid phase high temporal resolution film thickness measurements were conducted. Both measurement systems show qualitative comparable results to literature. Additionally, the sampled film thickness data were averaged to enable a time-independent interpretation. The investigation of the average film thickness in flow direction, without gas flow, revealed an increase in film thickness along flow direction for \(Re_{film}=500\). In contrast, for \(Re_{film}\geq 980\), an opposing trend was observed. Furthermore, the influence of gas flow on the average film thickness was investigated. The measurement results and high-speed camera images indicate that the test rig is capable of reaching flooding conditions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Wavy-Flap Airfoil Performance at Low Reynolds Number: Insights from Lift and Drag Coefficient Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines the aerodynamic performance of wavy (corrugated) airfoils, focusing specifically on analyzing the impact of two angles of attack: the airfoil's angle of attack and the tail's angle of attack (beta). Simulations were conducted using the W1011 airfoil at a Reynolds number of 200,000, considering attack angles of 0, 2, 5, and 8 degrees for the airfoil, and 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 degrees for the tail. The simulation outcomes were validated against experimental data from Williamson's laboratory. The findings indicate a notable increase in the lift coefficient for the wavy airfoils, especially at larger flap angles. Specifically, at a beta of 40 degrees, the lift coefficient of the wavy airfoil at a 10-degree angle of attack was nearly three times greater than in the other scenarios. In contrast, the drag coefficient also increased, but to a lesser extent, which suggests enhanced aerodynamic efficiency. Furthermore, the lift to drag ratio was significantly higher for the wavy airfoils, particularly at lower angles of attack. Overall, the study concludes that wavy airfoils, especially with higher tail angles, offer considerable aerodynamic benefits, especially in conditions of low angle attack, improving lift and fuel efficiency for use in both aviation and marine applications.</description>

      <title>Inertio-viscous interactions between particles in oscillatory flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between a pair of particles suspended in a uniform oscillatory flow. The time-averaged behavior of particles under these conditions, driven by inertial and viscous effects, is explored through a theoretical framework relying on small oscillation amplitude. We approximate the oscillatory flow in terms of dual multipole expansions, with which we compute time-averaged interaction forces using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with existing numerical data. We then develop analytic approximations for the force, valid when Stokes layers surrounding the particles do not overlap. Finally, we show how the same formalism can be generalized to the situation where the particles are free to oscillate and drift in response to the applied flow. The theory thus provides an efficient means to calculate nonlinear particle interactions in oscillatory flows.</description>

      <title>On spectral scaling laws for averaged turbulence on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral analysis for a class of Lagrangian-averaged Navier--Stokes (LANS) equations on the sphere is carried out. The equations arise from the Navier--Stokes equations by applying a Helmholtz filter of width $\alpha$ to the advecting velocity $\beta$ times. Power laws for the energy spectrum are derived and indicate a $\beta$-dependent scaling at wave numbers $l$ with $\alpha l\gg 1$. The energy and enstrophy transfer rates distinctly depend on the averaging, allowing control over the energy flux and the enstrophy flux separately through the choice of averaging operator. A necessary condition on the averaging operator is derived for the existence of the inverse cascade in two-dimensional turbulence. Numerical experiments with a structure-preserving integrator confirm the expected energy spectrum scalings and the robustness of the double cascade under choices of the averaging operator.</description>

      <title>A sharp-interface discontinuous Galerkin method for simulation of two-phase flow of real gases based on implicit shock tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order, sharp-interface method for simulation of two-phase flow of real gases using implicit shock tracking. The method is based on a phase-field formulation of two-phase, compressible, inviscid flow with a trivial mixture model. Implicit shock tracking is a high-order, optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that automatically aligns mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps. It is used to accurately approximate shocks and rarefactions without stabilization and converge the phase-field solution to a sharp interface one by aligning mesh faces with the material interface. Time-dependent problems are formulated as steady problems in a space-time domain where complex wave interactions (e.g., intersections and reflections) manifest as space-time triplet points. The space-time formulation avoids complex re-meshing and solution transfer that would be required to track moving waves with mesh faces using the method of lines. The approach is applied to several two-phase flow Riemann problems involving gases with ideal, stiffened gas, and Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) equations of state, including a spherically symmetric underwater explosion problem. In all cases, the method aligns element faces with all shocks (including secondary shocks that form at time t &gt; 0), rarefactions, and material interfaces, and accurately resolves the flow field on coarse space-time grids.</description>

      <title>Transient Growth in Streaky Unbounded Shear Flow: A symbiosis of Orr and Push-over mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient growth mechanisms operating on streaky shear flows are believed important for sustaining near-wall turbulence. Of the three individual mechanisms present - Orr, lift-up and 'push-over' - Lozano-Duran et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 914, A8, 2021) have recently observed that both Orr and push-over need to be present to sustain turbulent fluctuations given streaky (streamwise-independent) base fields whereas lift-up does not. We show here, using Kelvin's model of unbounded constant shear augmented by spanwise streaks, that this is because the push-over mechanism can act in concert with a 'spanwise' Orr mechanism to produce much-enhanced transient growth. In a reduced representation of the process which captures the growth properties of the full system, the optimal disturbance growth scales like $G \sim exp(\alpha\sqrt{Re})$ ($\alpha$ a constant and $Re$ the Reynolds number) for near-wall streak shears over 'intermediate' $O(\sqrt{Re})$ times, in contrast with the usual algebraic result of $G \sim Re^2$ produced by Orr or push-over separately over 'slow' $O(Re)$ times. Our results therefore support the view that while lift-up is believed central for the roll-to-streak regenerative process, it is Orr and push-over mechanisms that are both key for the streak-to-roll regenerative process in near-wall turbulence.</description>

      <title>Steady bubbles and drops in inviscid fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct steady non-spherical bubbles and drops, which are traveling wave solutions to the axisymmetric two-phase Euler equations with surface tension, whose inner phase is a bounded connected domain. The solutions have a uniform vorticity distribution in this inner phase and they have a vortex sheet on its surface.
  Our construction relies on a perturbative approach around an explicit spherical solution, given by Hill's vortex enclosed by a spherical vortex sheet. The construction is sensitive to the Weber numbers describing the flow. At critical Weber numbers, we perform a bifurcation analysis utilizing the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem in Sobolev spaces on the 2-sphere. Away from these critical numbers, our construction relies on the implicit function theorem.
  Our results imply that the model containing surface tension is richer than the ordinary one-phase Euler equations, in the sense that for the latter, Hill's spherical vortex is unique (modulo translations) among all axisymmetric simply connected uniform vortices of a given circulation.</description>

      <title>Global dissipative solutions of the 3D Naiver-Stokes and MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any divergence free initial data in $H^\frac12$, we prove the existence of infinitely many dissipative solutions to both the 3D Navier-Stokes and MHD equations, whose energy profiles are continuous and decreasing on $[0,\infty)$. If the initial data is only $L^2$, our construction yields infinitely many solutions with continuous energy, but not necessarily decreasing. Our theorem does not hold in the case of zero viscosity as this would violate the weak-strong uniqueness principle due to Lions. This was achieved by designing a convex integration scheme that takes advantage of the dissipative term.</description>

      <title>Arrested on heating: controlling the motility of active droplets by temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13442v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, we present an experimental system of self-propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the P\'eclet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which we can now tune by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. We quantify the droplet dynamics by analyzing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, we experimentally observe, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self-propelled motility.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation on mixed convection in turbulent channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied flow organization and heat transfer properties in mixed turbulent convection within Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard channels subjected to temporally modulated sinusoidal wall temperatures. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations were performed for Rayleigh numbers in the range $10^6 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, a Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$ and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b \approx 5623$. We found that high-frequency wall temperature oscillations had minimal impact on flow structures, while low-frequency oscillations induced adaptive changes, forming stable stratified layers during cooling. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis revealed a dominant streamwise unidirectional shear flow mode. Large-scale rolls oriented in the streamwise direction appeared as higher POD modes and were significantly influenced by lower-frequency wall temperature variations. Long-time-averaged statistics showed that the Nusselt number increased with decreasing frequency by up to 96\%, while the friction coefficient varied by less than 15\%. High-frequency modulation predominantly influenced near-wall regions, enhancing convective effects, whereas low frequencies reduced these effects via stable stratified layer formation. Phase-averaged statistics showed that high-frequency modulation resulted in phase-stable streamwise velocity and temperature profiles, while low-frequency modulation caused significant variations due to weakened turbulence. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles remained high near the wall during both heating and cooling at high frequency, but decreased during cooling at low frequencies. A TKE budget analysis revealed that during heating, TKE production was dominated by shear near the wall and by buoyancy in the bulk region; while during cooling, the production, distribution and dissipation of TKE were all nearly zero.</description>

      <title>Reduced order modeling of the unsteady pressure on turbine rotor blades using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In transonic turbine stages, complex interactions between trailing edge shocks from nozzle guide vanes and rotor blades generate unsteady wall pressure fields, impacting rotor aerodynamic performance and structural integrity. While shock-related phenomena are prominent, unsteady pressure fluctuations can also arise in subsonic regimes from wake interactions. Traditional methods like Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations are accurate but computationally expensive. To address this, a novel deep learning-based Reduced Order Model (ROM) is proposed, built on a database of URANS simulations, to predict unsteady pressure fields on turbine rotor blades at a fraction of the cost. The model consists of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) integrated with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture time-series data, overcoming the limitations of traditional linear ROMs in capturing nonlinear phenomena, such as moving shocks. The goal is to develop a ROM that accurately reproduces unsteady pressure fields from URANS simulations while reducing computational costs. The ROM is applied to the Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows (TATEF2) project configuration, a representative test case in turbomachinery research. Model performance is evaluated using machine learning quality metrics and design-oriented criteria, including the accuracy of the first harmonic in the Fourier transform of the unsteady pressure field. The impact of the simulation database size on model accuracy is also analyzed, considering the number of training simulations required for task-specific accuracy as a key factor in industrial applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with the wave equation for a wire (GP-W) provides a natural theoretical framework for understanding recent experiments employing a nanowire to detect a single quantum vortex in superfluid $^4 {\rm He}$. We uncover the complete spatiotemporal evolution of such wire-based vortex detection via direct numerical simulations of the GP-W system. Furthermore, by computing the spatiotemporal spectrum, we obtain the vortex-capture-induced change in the oscillation frequency of the wire. We quantify this frequency shift by plotting the wire's oscillation frequency versus time and obtain results that closely match experimental observations. In addition, we provide analytical support for our numerical results by deriving the dispersion relation for the oscillating wire, with and without a trapped vortex. We show that the Magnus force opens a gap in the wire dispersion relation. The size of the gap becomes the characteristic frequency of the wire when a vortex is trapped.</description>

      <title>Tracking the nonlinear formation of an interfacial wave spectral cascade from one to few to many</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of far-from-equilibrium systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade, where energy is transferred across length-scales following a simple power law. The universal nature of this phenomenon has led to advances in a range of disciplines, including climate forecasting, foreign exchange trading, and the modelling of neurological activity. For many diverse far-from-equilibrium scenarios, the scaling laws of steady states have been successfully predicted by the statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, originally developed by considering the leading order interactions between waves on a fluid surface. However, the predictive power of weak wave turbulence breaks down in the presence of large amplitudes, high dissipation, and finite-size effects. We offer new insight into these regimes by experimentally tracking the formation of a spectral cascade under these conditions in an externally driven fluid-fluid interface. We resolve individual wave modes and observe their time evolution from one to few to many, a process culminating in a steady state with a spectral density characterised by a power-law scaling. Our findings confirm that interfacial dynamics can be effectively modelled by a weakly nonlinear Lagrangian theory, a predictive framework encompassing both underlying wave interaction and emergent behaviours of the system. Such nonlinear interactions are experimentally quantified through statistical correlations, revealing a hierarchy in wave-mixing order that confirms a key assumption of weak wave turbulence. The Lagrangian formulation further aids our time-evolution analysis; specific interactions are tracked through time, and we predict the timescale until a cascade emerges. Our findings are transferable to other far-from-equilibrium systems, which we demonstrate by providing a mapping to reheating scenarios following cosmic inflation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Auto-Regressive Prediction using Lightweight AI Models: Adams-Bashforth Time Integration with Adaptive Multi-Step Rollout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions within scientific machine learning models by introducing innovative temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. Despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps (a 7:1 prediction-to-training ratio) achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions that shows potential for mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering disciplines.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>
