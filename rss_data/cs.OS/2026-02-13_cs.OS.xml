      <title>Bounded Local Generator Classes for Deterministic State Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize a constructive subclass of locality-preserving deterministic operators acting on graph-indexed state systems. We define the class of Bounded Local Generator Classes (BLGC), consisting of finite-range generators operating on bounded state spaces under deterministic composition. Within this class, incremental update cost is independent of total system dimension. We prove that, under the BLGC assumptions, per-step operator work satisfies W_t = O(1) as the number of nodes M \to \infty, establishing a structural decoupling between global state size and incremental computational effort. The framework admits a Hilbert-space embedding in \ell^2(V; \mathbb{R}^d) and yields bounded operator norms on admissible subspaces. The result applies specifically to the defined subclass and does not claim universality beyond the stated locality and boundedness constraints.</description>

      <title>Hardening the OSv Unikernel with Efficient Address Randomization: Design and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unikernels are single-purpose library operating systems that run the kernel and application in one address space, but often omit security mitigations such as address space layout randomization (ASLR). In OSv, boot, program loading, and thread creation select largely deterministic addresses, leading to near-identical layouts across instances and more repeatable exploitation. To reduce layout predictability, this research introduces ASLR-style diversity into OSv by randomizing the application base and thread stack regions through targeted changes to core memory-management and loading routines. The implementation adds minimal complexity while preserving OSv's lightweight design goals. Evaluation against an unmodified baseline finds comparable boot time, application runtime, and memory usage. Analysis indicates that the generated addresses exhibit a uniform distribution. These results show that layout-randomization defenses can be efficiently and effectively integrated into OSv unikernels, improving resistance to reliable exploitation.</description>

      <title>BYOS: Knowledge-driven Large Language Models Bring Your Own Operating System More Excellent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating system (OS) kernel tuning is a critical yet challenging problem for performance optimization, due to the large configuration space, complex interdependencies among configuration options, and the rapid evolution of kernel versions. Recent work has explored large language models (LLMs) for automated kernel tuning, but existing approaches often suffer from hallucinated configurations, limited interpretability, and poor robustness across workloads and kernel versions. We propose BYOS, a knowledge-driven framework that grounds LLM-based Linux kernel tuning in structured domain knowledge. BYOS incorporates three key components: (1) structured knowledge construction and mapping to bridge the semantic gap, (2) knowledge-driven configuration generation to refine the search space, and (3) continuous knowledge maintenance to adapt to kernel evolution. We evaluate BYOS on diverse workloads across multiple Linux distributions and kernel versions. Experimental results show that BYOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuning baselines, achieving 7.1%-155.4% performance improvement while substantially reducing invalid configurations. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured knowledge with LLMs for robust and scalable system optimization. The code of BYOS is available at https://github.com/LHY-24/BYOS.</description>
