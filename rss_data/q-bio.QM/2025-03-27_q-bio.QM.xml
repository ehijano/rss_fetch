      <title>CAN-STRESS: A Real-World Multimodal Dataset for Understanding Cannabis Use, Stress, and Physiological Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coping with stress is one of the most frequently cited reasons for chronic cannabis use. Therefore, it is hypothesized that cannabis users exhibit distinct physiological stress responses compared to non-users, and these differences would be more pronounced during moments of consumption. However, there is a scarcity of publicly available datasets that allow such hypotheses to be tested in real-world environments. This paper introduces a dataset named CAN-STRESS, collected using Empatica E4 wristbands. The dataset includes physiological measurements such as skin conductance, heart rate, and skin temperature from 82 participants (39 cannabis users and 43 non-users) as they went about their daily lives. Additionally, the dataset includes self-reported surveys where participants documented moments of cannabis consumption, exercise, and rated their perceived stress levels during those moments. In this paper, we publicly release the CAN-STRESS dataset, which we believe serves as a highly reliable resource for examining the impact of cannabis on stress and its associated physiological markers.

      <title>RxRx3-core: Benchmarking drug-target interactions in High-Content Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Content Screening (HCS) microscopy datasets have transformed the ability to profile cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, enabling cell-based inference of drug-target interactions (DTI). However, the adoption of representation learning methods for HCS data has been hindered by the lack of accessible datasets and robust benchmarks. To address this gap, we present RxRx3-core, a curated and compressed subset of the RxRx3 dataset, and an associated DTI benchmarking task. At just 18GB, RxRx3-core significantly reduces the size barrier associated with large-scale HCS datasets while preserving critical data necessary for benchmarking representation learning models against a zero-shot DTI prediction task. RxRx3-core includes 222,601 microscopy images spanning 736 CRISPR knockouts and 1,674 compounds at 8 concentrations. RxRx3-core is available on HuggingFace and Polaris, along with pre-trained embeddings and benchmarking code, ensuring accessibility for the research community. By providing a compact dataset and robust benchmarks, we aim to accelerate innovation in representation learning methods for HCS data and support the discovery of novel biological insights.</description>

      <title>The cell as a token: high-dimensional geometry in language models and cell embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell sequencing technology maps cells to a high-dimensional space encoding their internal activity. This process mirrors parallel developments in machine learning, where large language models ingest unstructured text by converting words into discrete tokens embedded within a high-dimensional vector space. This perspective explores how advances in understanding the structure of language embeddings can inform ongoing efforts to analyze and visualize single cell datasets. We discuss how the context of tokens influences the geometry of embedding space, and the role of low-dimensional manifolds in shaping this space's robustness and interpretability. We highlight new developments in language modeling, such as interpretability probes and in-context reasoning, that can inform future efforts to construct and consolidate cell atlases.</description>

      <title>Economic impact of biomarker-based aging interventions on healthcare costs and individual value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the economic impact of controlling the pace of aging through biomarker monitoring and targeted interventions. Using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock as a measure of biological aging rate, we model how different intervention scenarios affect frailty trajectories and their subsequent influence on healthcare costs, lifespan, and health quality. Our model demonstrates that controlling DunedinPACE from age 50 onwards can reduce frailty prevalence, resulting in cumulative healthcare savings of up to CHF 131,608 per person over 40 years in our most optimistic scenario. From an individual perspective, the willingness to pay for such interventions reaches CHF 6.7 million when accounting for both extended lifespan and improved health quality. These findings suggest substantial economic value in technologies that can monitor and modify biological aging rates, providing evidence for both healthcare systems and consumer-focused business models in longevity medicine.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Approaches for Blood Disease Diagnosis Across Hematopoietic Lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a foundation modeling framework that leverages deep learning to uncover latent genetic signatures across the hematopoietic hierarchy. Our approach trains a fully connected autoencoder on multipotent progenitor cells, reducing over 20,000 gene features to a 256-dimensional latent space that captures predictive information for both progenitor and downstream differentiated cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes. We validate the quality of these embeddings by training feed-forward, transformer, and graph convolutional architectures for blood disease diagnosis tasks. We also explore zero-shot prediction using a progenitor disease state classification model to classify downstream cell conditions. Our models achieve greater than 95% accuracy for multi-class classification, and in the zero-shot setting, we achieve greater than 0.7 F1-score on the binary classification task. Future work should improve embeddings further to increase robustness on lymphocyte classification specifically.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of the Total Quasi-Steady State Approximation for the Michaelis--Menten Enzyme Kinetic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing. We fill in this gap by deriving it as a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN), and also studying the fluctuations around this approximation as a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT).</description>

      <title>ProtoBERT-LoRA: Parameter-Efficient Prototypical Finetuning for Immunotherapy Study Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) studies in genomic repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is vital for cancer research yet remains challenging due to semantic ambiguity, extreme class imbalance, and limited labeled data in low-resource settings. We present ProtoBERT-LoRA, a hybrid framework that combines PubMedBERT with prototypical networks and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model enforces class-separable embeddings via episodic prototype training while preserving biomedical domain knowledge. Our dataset was divided as: Training (20 positive, 20 negative), Prototype Set (10 positive, 10 negative), Validation (20 positive, 200 negative), and Test (71 positive, 765 negative). Evaluated on test dataset, ProtoBERT-LoRA achieved F1-score of 0.624 (precision: 0.481, recall: 0.887), outperforming the rule-based system, machine learning baselines and finetuned PubMedBERT. Application to 44,287 unlabeled studies reduced manual review efforts by 82%. Ablation studies confirmed that combining prototypes with LoRA improved performance by 29% over stand-alone LoRA.</description>

      <title>From reductionism to realism: Holistic mathematical modelling for complex biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its core, the physics paradigm adopts a reductionist approach to modelling, aiming to understand fundamental phenomena by decomposing them into simpler, elementary processes. While this strategy has been tremendously successful in physics and is typically considered the pinnacle of scientific formulation, it has often fallen short in addressing fundamental questions in the biological sciences. This limitation arises from the inherent complexity of biological systems, characterised by heterogeneity, poly-functionality and interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the traditional framework of complex systems modelling also falls short, as its emphasis on broad theoretical principles has often failed to produce realistic, predictive, empirically grounded insights. To advance towards the goal of actionable mathematical models in biology, we argue here, using neuroscience as a case study, that it is necessary to move beyond simple reductionist approaches and instead embrace the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems-leveraging the growing availability of high-resolution data and recent advances in high-performance computing. In particular, we advocate for a holistic mathematical modelling paradigm that harnesses rich representational structures such as annotated and multilayer networks, employs agent-based models and simulation-based approaches, and focuses on the inverse problem of inferring system properties from dynamical observations. Finally, we emphasise that this approach is fully compatible with the search for fundamental principles in biophysics, and we highlight the substantial potential it holds to drive progress in mathematical biology over the next two decades.</description>

      <title>A Principal Submanifold-based Approach for Clustering and Multiscale RNA Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA structure determination is essential for understanding its biological functions. However, the reconstruction process often faces challenges, such as atomic clashes, which can lead to inaccurate models. To address these challenges, we introduce the principal submanifold (PSM) approach for analyzing RNA data on a torus. This method provides an accurate, low-dimensional feature representation, overcoming the limitations of previous torus-based methods. By combining PSM with DBSCAN, we propose a novel clustering technique, the principal submanifold-based DBSCAN (PSM-DBSCAN). Our approach achieves superior clustering accuracy and increased robustness to noise. Additionally, we apply this new method for multiscale corrections, effectively resolving RNA backbone clashes at both microscopic and mesoscopic scales. Extensive simulations and comparative studies highlight the enhanced precision and scalability of our method, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches. The proposed methodology offers a robust foundation for correcting complex RNA structures and has broad implications for applications in structural biology and bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Reliable algorithm selection for machine learning-guided design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for machine learning-guided design, or design algorithms, use machine learning-based predictions to propose novel objects with desired property values. Given a new design task -- for example, to design novel proteins with high binding affinity to a therapeutic target -- one must choose a design algorithm and specify any hyperparameters and predictive and/or generative models involved. How can these decisions be made such that the resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design algorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion -- for example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold. It does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from prediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data distributions are known. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated protein and RNA design tasks, in settings with either known or estimated density ratios.</description>

      <title>Leveraging statistical models to improve pre-season forecasting and in-season management of a recreational fishery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective management of recreational fisheries requires accurate forecasting of future harvests and real-time monitoring of ongoing harvests. Traditional methods that rely on historical catch data to predict short-term harvests can be unreliable, particularly if changes in management regulations alter angler behavior. In contrast, statistical modeling approaches can provide faster, more flexible, and potentially more accurate predictions, enhancing management outcomes. In this study, we developed and tested models to improve predictions of Gulf of Mexico gag harvests for both pre-season planning and in-season monitoring. Our best-fitting model outperformed traditional methods (i.e., estimates derived from historical average harvest) for both cumulative pre-season projections and in-season monitoring. Notably, our modeling framework appeared to be more accurate in more recent, shorter seasons due to its ability to account for effort compression. A key advantage of our framework is its ability to explicitly quantify the probability of exceeding harvest quotas for any given season duration. This feature enables managers to evaluate trade-offs between season duration and conservation goals. This is especially critical for vulnerable, highly targeted stocks. Our findings also underscore the value of statistical models to complement and advance traditional fisheries management approaches.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference: Diffusion Models as Expressive Variational Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02739v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI), a black-box variational inference algorithm for latent variable models which relies on diffusion models as flexible approximate posteriors. Specifically, our method introduces an expressive class of diffusion-based variational posteriors that perform iterative refinement in latent space; we train these posteriors with a novel regularized evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the marginal likelihood inspired by the wake-sleep algorithm. Our method is easy to implement (it fits a regularized extension of the ELBO), is compatible with black-box variational inference, and outperforms alternative classes of approximate posteriors based on normalizing flows or adversarial networks. We find that DDVI improves inference and learning in deep latent variable models across common benchmarks as well as on a motivating task in biology -- inferring latent ancestry from human genomes -- where it outperforms strong baselines on the Thousand Genomes dataset.</description>

      <title>Integrating Biological-Informed Recurrent Neural Networks for Glucose-Insulin Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management is a complex task due to many variability factors. Artificial Pancreas (AP) systems have alleviated patient burden by automating insulin delivery through advanced control algorithms. However, the effectiveness of these systems depends on accurate modeling of glucose-insulin dynamics, which traditional mathematical models often fail to capture due to their inability to adapt to patient-specific variations. This study introduces a Biological-Informed Recurrent Neural Network (BIRNN) framework to address these limitations. The BIRNN leverages a Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) architecture augmented with physics-informed loss functions that embed physiological constraints, ensuring a balance between predictive accuracy and consistency with biological principles. The framework is validated using the commercial UVA/Padova simulator, outperforming traditional linear models in glucose prediction accuracy and reconstruction of unmeasured states, even under circadian variations in insulin sensitivity. The results demonstrate the potential of BIRNN for personalized glucose regulation and future adaptive control strategies in AP systems.</description>
