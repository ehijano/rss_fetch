      <title>Giant Kohn anomaly and chiral phonons in the charge density wave phase of 1H-NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive investigations, many aspects of charge density waves (CDWs) remain elusive, especially the relative roles of electron-phonon coupling and Fermi surface nesting as the underlying driving mechanisms responsible for the emergence of the CDW vector $\bl Q_{CDW}$. It is puzzling that even though electrons interact strongly with optical phonons in many correlated systems, the actual mode softening is of an acoustic mode. Here we consider monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$ as an exemplar system, and through an accurate computation of the phonon self-energy, including its off-diagonal components. We provide compelling evidence that the relevant mode is a longitudinal optical phonon that softens by anti-crossing several intervening phonon bands. We also show that $\bl Q_{CDW}$ is fixed by the convolution of the susceptibility and electron-phonon coupling, and that the softened phonons are circularly polarized.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation for repulsive-to-attractive interaction quench in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate exotic dynamics when the interactions are suddenly switched from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive, a procedure known to generate super-Tonks-Girardeau gases in systems with contact interactions. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the relaxed state exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the coherent (quantum) gas and the chaotic (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting analogous results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce a slower initial entropy growth. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>
