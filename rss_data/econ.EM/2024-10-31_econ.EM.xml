      <title>Inference in Partially Linear Models under Dependent Data with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider inference in a partially linear regression model under stationary $\beta$-mixing data after first stage deep neural network (DNN) estimation. Using the DNN results of Brown (2024), I show that the estimator for the finite dimensional parameter, constructed using DNN-estimated nuisance components, achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality. By avoiding sample splitting, I address one of the key challenges in applying machine learning techniques to econometric models with dependent data. In a future version of this work, I plan to extend these results to obtain general conditions for semiparametric inference after DNN estimation of nuisance components, which will allow for considerations such as more efficient estimation procedures, and instrumental variable settings.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects in High-Frequency Event Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide precise conditions for nonparametric identification of causal effects by high-frequency event study regressions, which have been used widely in the recent macroeconomics, financial economics and political economy literatures. The high-frequency event study method regresses changes in an outcome variable on a measure of unexpected changes in a policy variable in a narrow time window around an event or a policy announcement (e.g., a 30-minute window around an FOMC announcement). We show that, contrary to popular belief, the narrow size of the window is not sufficient for identification. Rather, the population regression coefficient identifies a causal estimand when (i) the effect of the policy shock on the outcome does not depend on the other shocks (separability) and (ii) the surprise component of the news or event dominates all other shocks that are present in the event window (relative exogeneity). Technically, the latter condition requires the policy shock to have infinite variance in the event window. Under these conditions, we establish the causal meaning of the event study estimand corresponding to the regression coefficient and the consistency and asymptotic normality of the event study estimator. Notably, this standard linear regression estimator is robust to general forms of nonlinearity. We apply our results to Nakamura and Steinsson's (2018a) analysis of the real economic effects of monetary policy, providing a simple empirical procedure to analyze the extent to which the standard event study estimator adequately estimates causal effects of interest.</description>

      <title>Extracting Mechanisms from Heterogeneous Effects: An Identification Strategy for Mediation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04131v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal mechanisms is crucial for explaining and generalizing empirical phenomena. Causal mediation analysis offers statistical techniques to quantify the mediation effects. However, current methods often require multiple ignorability assumptions or sophisticated research designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel identification strategy that enables the simultaneous identification and estimation of treatment and mediation effects. By combining explicit and implicit mediation analysis, this strategy exploits heterogeneous treatment effects through a new decomposition of total treatment effects. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the method is more accurate and precise across various scenarios. To illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method, we apply it to estimate the causal mediation effects in two studies with distinct data structures, focusing on common pool resource governance and voting information. Additionally, we have developed statistical software to facilitate the implementation of our method.</description>

      <title>Designing Algorithmic Recommendations to Achieve Human-AI Complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms frequently assist, rather than replace, human decision-makers. However, the design and analysis of algorithms often focus on predicting outcomes and do not explicitly model their effect on human decisions. This discrepancy between the design and role of algorithmic assistants becomes particularly concerning in light of empirical evidence that suggests that algorithmic assistants again and again fail to improve human decisions. In this article, we formalize the design of recommendation algorithms that assist human decision-makers without making restrictive ex-ante assumptions about how recommendations affect decisions. We formulate an algorithmic-design problem that leverages the potential-outcomes framework from causal inference to model the effect of recommendations on a human decision-maker's binary treatment choice. Within this model, we introduce a monotonicity assumption that leads to an intuitive classification of human responses to the algorithm. Under this assumption, we can express the human's response to algorithmic recommendations in terms of their compliance with the algorithm and the active decision they would take if the algorithm sends no recommendation. We showcase the utility of our framework using an online experiment that simulates a hiring task. We argue that our approach can make sense of the relative performance of different recommendation algorithms in the experiment and can help design solutions that realize human-AI complementarity. Finally, we leverage our approach to derive minimax optimal recommendation algorithms that can be implemented with machine learning using limited training data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive preference learning systems present humans with queries as pairs of options; humans then select their preferred choice, allowing the system to infer preferences from these binary choices. While binary choice feedback is simple and widely used, it offers limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which inversely correlate with preference strength, as complementary information. We introduce a computationally efficient method based on the EZ-diffusion model, combining choices and response times to estimate the underlying human utility function. Theoretical and empirical comparisons with traditional choice-only estimators show that for queries where humans have strong preferences (i.e., "easy" queries), response times provide valuable complementary information and enhance utility estimates. We integrate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating response times significantly accelerates preference learning.</description>
