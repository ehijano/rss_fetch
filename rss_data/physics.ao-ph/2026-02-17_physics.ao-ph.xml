      <title>Climate network and complexity based ENSO forecast for 2026</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant driver of interannual global climate variability and can lead to extreme weather events such as droughts or flooding. Recently, we have developed several statistical approaches for early ENSO forecasting, in particular, its El Ni\~no phase. The climate network-based approach allows forecasting the onset of an El Ni\~no event or its absence about 1 year ahead [1]. The complexity-based approach allows additionally to forecast the magnitude of an upcoming El Ni\~no event in the calendar year before the onset [2]. Additionally, we have developed methods for forecasting the type (Eastern Pacific or Central Pacific) of an El Ni\~no [3] and for probabilistic forecasting of La Ni\~na and neutral events [4], also by the end of the calendar year before the event. Here we present the forecasts of these methods for 2026. The climate network and the complexity-based approach do not provide concurring signals for this year. The combined forecast indicates that a neutral event is more likely than an El Ni\~no. If an El Ni\~no develops in 2026, the complexity-based approach predicts a weaker event with a magnitude of $0.84\pm0.36${\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Preliminary sonification of ENSO using traditional Javanese gamelan scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sonification -- the mapping of data to non-speech audio -- offers an underexplored channel for representing complex dynamical systems. We treat El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a canonical example of low-dimensional climate chaos, as a test case for culturally-situated sonification evaluated through complex systems diagnostics. Using parameter-mapping sonification of the Ni\~{n}o 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly index (1870--2024), we encode ENSO variability into two traditional Javanese gamelan pentatonic systems (pelog and slendro) across four composition strategies, then analyze the resulting audio as trajectories in a two-dimensional acoustic phase space. Recurrence-based diagnostics, convex hull geometry, and coupling analysis reveal that the sonification pipeline preserves key dynamical signatures: alternating modes produce the highest trajectory recurrence rates, echoing ENSO's quasi-periodicity; layered polyphonic modes explore the broadest phase space regions; and the two scale families induce qualitatively distinct coupling regimes between spectral brightness and energy -- predominantly anti-phase in pelog but near-independent in slendro. Phase space trajectory analysis provides a rigorous geometric framework for comparing sonification designs within a complex systems context. Perceptual validation remains necessary; we contribute the dynamical systems methodology for evaluating such mappings.</description>

      <title>PDE foundation models are skillful AI weather emulators for the Martian atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that AI foundation models that are pretrained on numerical solutions to a diverse corpus of partial differential equations can be adapted and fine-tuned to obtain skillful predictive weather emulators for the Martian atmosphere. We base our work on the Poseidon PDE foundation model for two-dimensional systems. We develop a method to extend Poseidon from two to three dimensions while keeping the pretraining information. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the model in the presence of sparse initial conditions. Our results make use of four Martian years (approx.~34 GB) of training data and a median compute budget of 13 GPU hours. We find that the combination of pretraining and model extension yields a performance increase of 34.4\% on a held-out year. This shows that PDEs-FMs can not only approximate solutions to (other) PDEs but also anchor models for real-world problems with complex interactions that lack a sufficient amount of training data or a suitable compute budget.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AI-based data assimilation to advance data-driven global weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Data Assimilation (DA) is expanding rapidly. However, the absence of an objective, comprehensive, and real-world benchmark hinders the fair comparison of diverse methods. Here, we introduce DABench, a benchmark designed for contributing to the development and evaluation of AI-based DA methods. By integrating real-world observations, DABench provides an objective and fair platform for validating long-term closed-loop DA cycles, supporting both deterministic and ensemble configurations. Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of AI-based DA in generating initial conditions for the advanced AI-based weather forecasting model to produce accurate medium-range global weather forecasting. Our dual-validation, utilizing both reanalysis data and independent radiosonde observations, demonstrates that AI-based DA achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art AI-driven four-dimensional variational frameworks across both global weather DA and medium-range forecasting metrics. We invite the research community to utilize DABench to accelerate the advancement of AI-based DA for global weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases -- OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite well-meaning scenarios that propose global CO2 emissions will decline presented in every IPCC report since 1988, the trend of global CO2 increase continues without significant change. Even if any individual nation manages to flatten its emissions, what matters is the trajectory of the globe. Together the gulf between climate science and climate economics, plus the urgent need for alternative methods of estimation, provided the incentives for development of our Ocean-Heat-Content (OHC) Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) system.
  To link NOAA damages to climate required creating a carbon consumption model to drive a physics model of climate. How fast could carbon be burned and how much coal, oil and natural gas was reasonably available? A carbon model driving climate meant burning the carbon, and modelling how the earth heated up. We developed this using the most recent best greenhouse gas equations and production models for CO2, CH4, N2O, and halogenated gases. This developed an ocean heat content model for the globe. Each step is validated against Known carbon consumption, CO2, temperature, and ocean heat content. This allows a physics founded model of climate costs to be projected.</description>
