      <title>On computable classes of equidistant sets: multivariate equidistant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equidistant set in the Euclidean space consists of points having equal distances to both members of a given pair of sets, called focal sets. Having no effective formulas to compute the distance of a point and a set, it is hard to determine the points of an equidistant set in general. Special classes of equidistant sets allow us to approximate the equidistant points in more complicated cases. In the paper we have a hyperplane corresponding to the first order (linear) approximation for one of the focal sets and the second one is considered as the epigraph of a positive-valued continuous function. In the first part of the paper we prove that the equidistant points having equal distances to the epigraph of a positive-valued continuous function and its domain form the graph of a multivariate function. Therefore such an equidistant set is called a multivariate equidistant function. We also prove that the equidistant function one of whose focal sets is constituted by the pointwise minima of finitely many positive-valued continuous functions is given by the pointwise minima of the corresponding equidistant functions. In the second part of the paper we consider equidistant functions belonging to the epigraph of a convex function under some smoothness conditions. Independently of the dimension of the space we present a special parameterization for the equidistant points based on the closest point property of the epigraph as a convex set and we give the characterization of the equidistant functions as well. An example is also presented with a hyperboloid of revolution as one of the focal sets.</description>

      <title>On the polar of Schneider's difference body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order extension of the difference body $DK$ of a convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^n$, the convex body $D^m(K)$ in $\mathbb R^{nm}$. He conjectured that its volume is minimized for ellipsoids when the volume of $K$ is fixed.
  In this note we solve a dual version of this problem: we show that the volume of the polar body of $D^m(K)$ is maximized precisely by ellipsoids. For $m=1$ this recovers the symmetric case of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. We also show that Schneider's conjecture cannot be tackled using standard symmetrization techniques, contrary to this new inequality. As an application for our results, we prove Schneider's conjecture asymptotically \'a la Bourgain-Milman. We also consider a functional version.</description>

      <title>A Klain-Schneider Theorem for Vector-Valued Valuations on Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A functional analog of the Klain-Schneider theorem for vector-valued valuations on convex functions is established, providing a classification of continuous, translation covariant, simple valuations. Under additional rotation equivariance assumptions, an analytic counterpart of the moment vector is characterized alongside a new epi-translation invariant valuation. The former arises as the top-degree operator in a family of functional intrinsic moments, which are linked to functional intrinsic volumes through translations. The latter represents the top-degree operator in a class of Minkowski vectors, which are introduced in this article and which lack classical counterparts on convex bodies, as they vanish due to the Minkowski relations. Additional classification results are obtained for homogeneous valuations of extremal degrees.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative convolution with symmetries in Euclidean space and on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplicative convolution $\mu \ast \nu$ of two finite signed measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a related product $\mu \circledast \nu$ on the sphere $S^{n-1}$ are studied. For fixed $\mu$ the injectivity in $\nu$ of both operations is characterised given an arbitrary group of reflections along the coordinate axes. The results for the sphere yield generalised versions of the theorems in Molchanov and Nagel (2021) about convex bodies.</description>

      <title>On boundaries of bicombable spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate systematic study of EZ-structures (and associated boundaries) of groups acting on spaces that admit consistent and conical (equivalently, consistent and convex) geodesic bicombings. Such spaces recently drew a lot of attention due to the fact that many classical groups act `nicely' on them. We rigorously construct EZ-structures, discuss their uniqueness (up to homeomorphism), provide examples, and prove some boundary-related features analogous to the ones exhibited by CAT(0) spaces and groups, which form a subclass of the discussed class of spaces and groups.</description>

      <title>Local inverse measure-theoretic entropy for endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of local inverse metric entropy along backward trajectories for ergodic measures preserved by endomorphisms (non-invertible maps) on a compact metric space. A second notion of inverse measure entropy is defined by using measurable partitions. Our notions have several useful applications. Inverse entropy can distinguish between isomorphism classes of endomorphisms on Lebesgue spaces, when they have the same forward measure-theoretic entropy. In a general setting we prove that the local inverse entropy of an ergodic measure \mu is equal to the forward entropy minus the folding entropy. The inverse entropy of hyperbolic measures on compact manifolds is explored, focusing on their negative Lyapunov exponents. We compute next the inverse entropy of the inverse SRB measure on a hyperbolic repellor. We prove an entropy rigidity result for special Anosov endomorphisms of \mathbb T^2, namely that they can be classified up to smooth conjugacy by knowing the entropy of their SRB measure and the inverse entropy of their inverse SRB measure. Next we study the relations between our inverse measure-theoretic entropy and the generalized topological inverse entropy on subsets of prehistories. In general we establish a Partial Variational Principle for inverse entropy. We obtain also a Full Variational Principle for inverse entropy in the case of special TA-covering maps on tori. In the end, several examples of endomorphisms are studied, such as fat baker transformations, fat solenoidal attractors, special Anosov endomorphisms, toral endomorphisms, and the local inverse entropy is computed for their SRB measures.</description>

      <title>Counting for rigidity under projective transformations in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of points and $L$ a set of lines in the (extended) Euclidean plane, and $I \subseteq P\times L$, where $i =(p,l) \in I$ means that point $p$ and line $l$ are incident. The incidences can be interpreted as quadratic constraints on the homogeneous coordinates of the points and lines. We study the space of incidence preserving motions of the given incidence structure by linearizing the system of quadratic equations. The Jacobian of the quadratic system, our projective rigidity matrix, leads to the notion of independence/dependence of incidences. Column dependencies correspond to infinitesimal motions. Row dependencies or self-stresses allow for new interpretations of classical geometric incidence theorems. We show that self-stresses are characterized by a 3-fold balance. As expected, infinitesimal (first order) projective rigidity as well as second order projective rigidity imply projective rigidity but not conversely. Several open problems and possible generalizations are indicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any full and faithful $*$-functor between approximable categories of locally finite coarse spaces induces a coarse embedding between the underlying spaces. Furthermore, we establish a general characterisation of such $*$-functors between approximable categories and prove that the functor associating each locally finite coarse space with its approximable category is full and faithful.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometries between graphs with variable edge lengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-isometries between graphs with variable edge lengths. A quasi-isometry is a mapping between metric spaces that approximately preserves distances, allowing for a bounded amount of additive and multiplicative distortion. Recently, Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour conjectured that, by appropriately adjusting the edge lengths of the target graph along with modifying the additive distortion constant, the multiplicative distortion factor could be eliminated. We disprove this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We describe some recent results on the dimensions of linear projections of self-affine fractals, focusing in particular on an upper bound for the dimension of the projected image. We give a self-contained treatment of this bound and illustrate it through explicit examples, in the process exhibiting some smooth submanifolds of the Grassmannian which can be contained in the exceptional set in Marstrand's theorem.</description>

      <title>Neural Snowflakes: Universal Latent Graph Inference via Trainable Latent Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.</description>

      <title>A rigidity framework for Roe-like algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13624v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this memoir we develop a framework to study rigidity problems for Roe-like C*-algebras of countably generated coarse spaces. The main goal is to give a complete and self-contained solution to the problem of C*-rigidity for proper (extended) metric spaces. Namely, we show that (stable) isomorphisms among Roe algebras always give rise to coarse equivalences. The material is organized as to provide a unified proof of C*-rigidity for Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators. We also prove a more refined C*-rigidity statement which has several additional applications. For instance, we can put the correspondence between coarse geometry and operator algebras in a categorical framework, and we prove that the outer automorphism groups of these C*-algebras are all isomorphic to the group of coarse equivalences of the coarse space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic embeddings of finite metric spaces into graph-theoretic trees have proven to be a vital tool for constructing approximation algorithms in theoretical computer science. In the present work, we build out some of the basic theory of stochastic embeddings in the infinite setting with an aim towards applications to Lipschitz free space theory. We prove that proper metric spaces stochastically embedding into $\mathbb{R}$-trees have Lipschitz free spaces isomorphic to $L^1$-spaces. We then undergo a systematic study of stochastic embeddability of Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces into $\mathbb{R}$-trees by way of stochastic embeddability of their boundaries into ultrametric spaces. The following are obtained as our main results: (1) Every snowflake of a compact, finite Nagata-dimensional metric space stochastically embeds into an ultrametric space and has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$. (2) The Lipschitz free space over hyperbolic $n$-space is isomorphic to the Lipschitz free space over Euclidean $n$-space. (3) Every infinite, finitely generated hyperbolic group stochastically embeds into an $\mathbb{R}$-tree, has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$, and admits a proper, uniformly Lipschitz affine action on $\ell^1$.</description>

      <title>Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.</description>
