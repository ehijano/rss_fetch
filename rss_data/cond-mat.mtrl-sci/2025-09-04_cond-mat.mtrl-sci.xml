      <title>Etching-free dual-lift-off for direct patterning of epitaxial oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although monocrystalline oxide films offer broad functional capabilities, their practical use is hampered by challenges in patterning. Traditional patterning relies on etching, which can be costly and prone to issues like film or substrate damage, under-etching, over-etching, and lateral etching. In this study, we introduce a dual-lift-off method for direct patterning of oxide films, circumventing the etching process and associated issues. Our method involves an initial lift-off of amorphous Sr$_3$Al$_2$O$_6$ or Sr$_4$Al$_2$O$_7$ ($a$SAO) through stripping the photoresist, followed by a subsequent lift-off of the functional oxide thin films by dissolving the $a$SAO layer. $a$SAO functions as a ``high-temperature photoresist", making it compatible with the high-temperature growth of monocrystalline oxides. Using this method, patterned ferromagnetic La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ and ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$ were fabricated, accurately mirroring the shape of the photoresist. Our study presents a straightforward, flexible, precise, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective method for patterning high-quality oxide thin films.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Crystal Structures: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As in many other fields, the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence is reshaping materials discovery by offering new ways to propose crystal structures and, in some cases, even predict desired properties. This review provides a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in generative models specifically for inorganic crystalline materials. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of generative modeling and invertible material descriptors. We then propose a taxonomy based on architecture, representation, conditioning, and materials domain to categorize the diverse range of current generative AI models. We discuss data sources and address challenges related to performance metrics, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarks. Specific examples and applications of novel generated structures are presented. Finally, we examine current limitations and future directions in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting its potential to accelerate the discovery of new inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>$P$-type Ru$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Hf$_x$Si full-Heusler bulk thermoelectrics with $zT = 0.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heusler compounds have emerged as important thermoelectric materials due to their combination of promising electronic transport properties, mechanical robustness and chemical stability -- key aspects for practical device integration. While a wide range of XYZ-type half-Heusler compounds have been studied for high-temperature applications, X$_2$YZ-type full-Heuslers, often characterized by narrower band gaps, may offer potential advantages at different temperature regimes but remain less explored. In this work, we report the discovery of $p$-type Ru$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Hf$_x$Si full-Heusler thermoelectrics, exhibiting a high figure of merit $zT \sim 0.7$ over a broad range of temperatures $700-1000$ K. These results not only represent the largest values known to date among full-Heusler materials but confirm earlier theoretical predictions that $p$-type Ru$_2$TiSi systems would be superior to their $n$-type counterparts. Moreover, using a two-band model, we unveil electronic structure changes induced by the Hf substitution at the Ti site and outline strategies to further improve $zT$ up to $zT &gt; 1$. Our findings highlight the untapped potential of new semiconducting full-Heusler phases and the crucial need for continued exploration of this rich materials class for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of low-angle grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) merge and grains disappear during microstructure evolution. However, the Peach-Koehler model predicts that particular stress states may reverse such a process by exerting differential Peach-Koehler forces on different dislocations. This work considers this reversal as GB decomposition and illustrates it in a low-angle asymmetric tilt GB and a low-angle mixed tilt-twist GB via atomistic simulation. In both cases, the dislocations separate into two GBs separated by a new grain. This work describes the requirements for decomposition and the importance of dislocation separability. Additionally, we examine the dislocation behaviors and stress signatures associated with this process, along with the impact of strain rate and temperature on those aspects.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Composition Modulated Solidification and Mechanical Properties of Al-Cu Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of space exploration and human settlement beyond Earth hinges on a deeper understanding of in space manufacturing processes. The unique physical conditions and scarcity of experimental data demand robust computational models to investigate the atomic scale physics of solidification. This work presents a molecular dynamics (MD) model to examine the solidification behavior of the Al Cu binary alloy, focusing on the influence of varying compositions and gravity levels (Earth, Lunar, Martian, and microgravity) on atomistic solidification mechanisms and the resulting mechanical properties specifically, hardness of as solidified nanostructures. Hardness is evaluated via nanoindentation simulations. The study confirms that gravitational forces significantly affect the solidification pathways of Al Cu alloys. Notably, by tuning alloy composition, the influence of gravity can be modulated and in some cases, even reversed. Moreover, hardness exhibits a coupled dependence on both composition and gravity, offering a promising avenue for bottom-up design of components tailored for extraterrestrial environments. The article delves into the nanoscale physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena and outlines future directions for extending this modeling framework to broader applications.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable band structure in ferroelectric R-stacked bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers unite two frontiers of quantum materials research: sliding ferroelectricity, arising from rhombohedral (R) stacking, and moir\'e quantum matter, emerging from small-angle twisting. The spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric R-stacked homobilayers produces a highly tunable band structure, which, together with strain-induced piezoelectricity, governs the topology and correlated electronic phases of twisted bilayers. Here we present a systematic low-temperature optical spectroscopy study of R-stacked bilayer WSe$_2$ to quantitatively establish its fundamental electronic and ferroelectric properties. Exciton and exciton-polaron spectroscopy under doping reveals a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry that confirms type-II band alignment, with the conduction and valence band edges located at the $\Lambda$ and K valleys, respectively. Through distinct excitonic responses and tunable interlayer-intralayer exciton hybridization under displacement fields, we uncover the coexistence of AB and BA ferroelectric domains. Using exciton-polarons as a probe, we directly measure the intrinsic polarization field and extract the interlayer potential. Finally, we demonstrate electric-field-driven symmetric switching of the valence band maximum, attributed to ferroelectric domain switching. These results provide a complete experimental picture of the band alignment, spontaneous polarization field, and domain dynamics of R-stacked WSe$_2$, establishing key parameters to understand twisted bilayers and enabling new ferroelectric and excitonic device opportunities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic resonance and microwave resistance modulation in van der Waals colossal-magnetoresistance material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is a fascinating quantum phenomenon that continues to draw significant interest in condensed matter physics. Mn3Si2Te6 has emerged as a prototypical CMR material, notable for its puzzling magnetoresistance behavior and pronounced directional anisotropy. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms driving CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 remain elusive [1-4]. In this work, we explore the magnetic resonance of Mn3Si2Te6 and observe a reduced g-factor for magnetic fields applied along the crystalline c-axis compared to the ab-plane, indicating a substantial orbital magnetization contribution along the c-axis. Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to the out-of-the plane spin polarization. These findings shed new light on the role of orbital magnetic moment in Mn3Si2Te6, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom of electrons in this system.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coatings on Various Substrates for Self-Adaptive Energy Harvesting with Daytime Solar Heating and Nighttime Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) metafilms on different substrate materials fabricated via low-oxygen furnace oxidation are demonstrated for self-adaptive daytime solar heating and nighttime radiative cooling. Because of its thermally-driven insulator-to-metal phase transition behavior, the VO2 metafilms work as spectrally-selective solar absorber with a high solar absorptance of 0.86 and a low infrared emissivity of ~0.2 at daytime, while they behave as selective cooler at nighttime to dissipate heat effectively through the atmospheric transparency window with a high emissivity of ~0.76 to cold outer space. From the outdoor vacuum tests, a significant temperature rise up to 169 K upon solar heating and a temperature drop of 17 K at night are experimentally observed from these tunable VO2 metafilms. With the atmosphere temperature fitted in-situ, the accurate heat transfer model shows excellent agreement with the stagnation temperature measurement, and indicates a high heating power of ~400 W/m2 at 80{\deg}C sample temperature in the middle of the day, and a cooling power of ~60 W/m2 at 30{\deg}C in equilibrium with ambient at night. This work would facilitate the development of self-adaptive coatings with cost-effective and scalable fabrication approaches for all-day energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Structural Motifs in Ag$_n$Mo (n = 2-13) Clusters: From Planar to Icosahedral Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of Mo-doped silver clusters Ag$_n$Mo ($n=1$-14), focusing on their structural, electronic, and bonding properties. Global optimization reveals an evolution from planar and low-symmetry isomers in small clusters to compact three-dimensional geometries with higher symmetry, culminating in a highly stable icosahedral structure at $n=12$. Binding energy and second-order energy difference analyses identify $n=12$ as a "magic number" cluster exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability and a pronounced HOMO-LUMO gap, indicative of electronic shell closure. Bond length analysis shows relatively constant Ag-Mo distances alongside a size-dependent increase in Ag-Ag bond lengths, reflecting the growth of metallic bonding networks. Hirshfeld charge analysis reveals significant charge transfer from Ag to Mo in small clusters, which decreases with size as the system transitions toward delocalized metallic bonding. These findings provide detailed insights into the size-dependent interplay of geometry, bonding, and electronic structure in Ag$_n$Mo clusters, with implications for their catalytic and material applications.</description>

      <title>Octupole-driven spin-transfer torque switching of all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferromagnets are canonical devices in spintronics, with wide-ranging applications in data storage, computing, and sensing. They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of magnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and reciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through spin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects could be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials, since they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral antiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment, which are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the reciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by currents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total electric current being spin-neutral. Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we report nanoscale AFMTJs exhibiting this reciprocal effect, which we term octupole-driven spin-transfer torque (OTT). We demonstrate current-induced OTT switching of PtMn3|MgO|PtMn3 AFMTJs, fabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate, exhibiting a record-high TMR value of 363% at room temperature and switching current densities of the order of 10 MA/cm2. Our theoretical modeling explains the origin of OTT in terms of the imbalance between intra- and inter-sublattice spin currents across the AFMTJ, and equivalently, in terms of the non-zero net cluster octupole polarization of each PtMn3 layer. This work establishes a new materials platform for antiferromagnetic spintronics and provides a pathway towards deeply scaled magnetic memory and room-temperature terahertz technologies.</description>

      <title>Probing ice-rule-breaking transition in $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film by proximitized transport and magnetic torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and $\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective nearest-neighbor interaction and distorted Ising spin axes compared to the bulk crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Silicon-monoxide flames: the nucleation and condensation of silica fume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03106v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica fume is a valuable by-product from the silicon and ferrosilicon production. It is therefore important to understand the impact on the silica fume quality when converting the furnace feed from fossil-based to renewable reduction materials. Using self-consistent numerical simulations of the nucleation and condensation process, we present a detailed study of the silica fume formation process.
  It is found that the most critical physical effect that determines the final particle size distribution is coalescence due to Brownian motion. Furthermore, it is crucial to use appropriate thermophysical parameters in order to reproduce reliable particle size distributions. Contrary to what has been done in previous studies on the same topic, this is now done by using reasonable expressions for surface energy, saturation pressure and the nucleation pre-exponential factor.
  It is also found that under conditions relevant to furnaces, the liberation of latent heat leads to an explosive chain reaction of particle nucleation and condensation when the first particles nucleate and start growing due to condensation. This process continues until the relative saturation pressure of silicon dioxide is reduced to unity.
  Finally, it is found that the Lagrangian approach for particle tracking is more flexible and accurate, and also more CPU efficient, than the Eulerian approach.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity of Magnetism and Nanostructure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of thin films and nanostructures is a fundamental process for constructing both model-type systems and nanoscale devices, where performance and functionalities can be controlled by the choice of parameters. For magnetic systems the crystal structure, material composition, size, and shape determine already most of the magnetism-related properties. Here, we investigate the reciprocal route, which is controlling nanostructure growth via magnetism. To this end we deposit Co on a uniaxial antiferromagnetic surface above and below its N\'eel temperature. Growth above the N\'eel temperature results in the formation of roughly hexagonal islands, reflecting the surface symmetry. For growth below the N\'eel temperature we find quasi-one-dimensional Co nanostructures along distinct crystallographic directions, which signal the local antiferromagnetic domain orientation. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of controlling growth via magnetism and the necessity to take magnetism-related effects into account for growth on magnetic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Shift Current Anomalous Photovoltaics in a Double Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric anomalous photovoltaic (APV) effect, as a fascinating physical conceptual phenomenon, holds significant potentials for new optoelectronic device applications. However, due to the knowledge lacking on the origin and underlying mechanism of ferroelectric APV effect, substantial challenges still remain in exploring new APV-active candidate materials. The emerging shift current model, involving the transfer of photogenerated charges through the displacement of wave functions, has attracted considerable attention for its unique insights into the bulk photovoltaic effect. Here, we present strong APV properties in a high-temperature double perovskite ferroelectric (cyclohexylmethylammonium)$_2$CsAgBiBr$_7$, showing an extremely large above-bandgap photovoltage up to about 40 V. This figure-of-merit is far beyond its bandgap of about 2.3 eV and comparable to the state-of-art molecular ferroelectrics. Strikingly, the shift current model reveals an intrinsic correlation with Cs$^{+}$ cation displacement and provides, for the first time, an explicit explanation for the structural origin of ferroelectric APV activities. Besides, its steady-state APV photocurrent exhibits the unique light-polarization dependence, which endows remarkable polarization-sensitivity with the highest polarization ratios of about 41 among the known 2D single-phase materials. As the unprecedented exploration of ferroelectric APV characteristics illuminated by the shift current mechanism, this finding paves a pathway to assemble new optoelectronic smart devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable route to the deterministic fabrication of impurity ion donors in silicon is required to advance quantum computing architectures based upon such systems. This paper reports the ability to dope isotopically-defined unique (${}^{121}\mathrm{Sb}{}^{123}\mathrm{Sb}$) clusters into silicon with measured detection efficiencies of 94% being obtained. Atomically resolved imaging of the doped clusters reveals a Sb-to-Sb separation of ~2 nm post-implantation, thus indicating suitability to form coupled qudit systems. The method used is fully compatible with integration into processing that includes pre-enrichment of the silicon host to &lt; 3ppm ${}^{29}\mathrm{Si}$ levels. As such, we present a potential pathway to the creation of scaled qudit arrays within silicon platforms for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of the Moir\'e surface state on a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Moire superlattice on the topological insulator surface is predicted to exhibit many novel properties but has not been experimentally realized. Here, we developed a two-step growth method to successfully fabricate a topological insulator Sb2Te3 thin film with a Moire superlattice, which is generated by a twist of the topmost layer via molecular beam epitaxy. The established Moire topological surface state is characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. By application of a magnetic field, new features in Landau levels arise on the Moire region compared to the pristine surface of Sb2Te3, which makes the system a promising platform for pursuing next-generation electronics. Notably, the growth method, which circumvents contamination and the induced interface defects in the manual fabrication method, can be widely applied to other van der Waals materials for fabricating Moire superlattices.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Assessment and Benchmark Study of Large Atomistic Foundation Models for Phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of universal machine learning potentials (uMLPs) has enabled efficient, accurate predictions of diverse material properties across broad chemical spaces. While their capability for modeling phonon properties is emerging, systematic benchmarking across chemically diverse systems remains limited. We evaluate six recent uMLPs (EquiformerV2, MatterSim, MACE, and CHGNet) on 2,429 crystalline materials from the Open Quantum Materials Database. Models were used to compute atomic forces in displaced supercells, derive interatomic force constants (IFCs), and predict phonon properties including lattice thermal conductivity (LTC), compared with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental data. The EquiformerV2 pretrained model trained on the OMat24 dataset exhibits strong performance in predicting atomic forces and third-order IFC, while its fine-tuned counterpart consistently outperforms other models in predicting second-order IFC, LTC, and other phonon properties. Although MACE and CHGNet demonstrated comparable force prediction accuracy to EquiformerV2, notable discrepancies in IFC fitting led to poor LTC predictions. Conversely, MatterSim, despite lower force accuracy, achieved intermediate IFC predictions, suggesting error cancellation and complex relationships between force accuracy and phonon predictions. This benchmark guides the evaluation and selection of uMLPs for high-throughput screening of materials with targeted thermal transport properties.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second-harmonic generation from WS$_2$/ReSe$_2$ heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals stacking presents new opportunities for nonlinear optics with its remarkable tunability and scalability. However, the fundamental role of interlayer interactions in modifying the overall nonlinear optical susceptibilities remains elusive. In this letter, we report an anisotropic enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) from a WS$_2$/ReSe$_2$ heterobilayer, where the individual composite layers possess distinctive crystal phases. We investigate polarization-resolved response and twist-angle dependence in SHG and reveal that band alignment alone is insufficient to explain the observed anisotropy in the modified SHG response. Spectral shifts in excitonic features highlight band renormalization, supporting the role of hybridization between the two layers. Furthermore, SHG enhancement is highly anisotropic and can even be suppressed in some orientations, suggesting possible intensity-borrowing mechanisms within the heterostructure. Our work demonstrates the ability to tune both the intensity and polarization dependence of nonlinear optical responses with van der Waals stacking of distinctive crystal phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various aspects of the methods of physical and physicochemical modification of components of filled thermoplastic composite materials are analyzed, aimed at improving the surface properties of the fillers and the technological properties of the polymer matrix during their interaction. It is noted that the improvement of the interfacial interaction of the components of polymer reactoplastic composites, including adhesive strength, is a key factor for improving the reliability of the cured filled composite. As a promising area of research, a modification of the surface of the reinforcing fibrous filler and the technological characteristics of the liquid polymer binder, aimed at increasing their contact properties in the composite, was chosen. The effectiveness of the physical method of modifying the components of composites in the form of low-frequency ultrasonic processing is described. The peculiarities of cluster formation and physicochemical modification of epoxy polymers filled with dispersed fillers are analyzed. Attention is focused on the effectiveness of ultrasonic processing in the cavitation mode for deagglomeration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid medium during the creation of nanocomposites. Experimentally confirmed is the improvement of the technological properties of liquid epoxy polymers, modified by ultrasound, used for the impregnation of oriented fibrous fillers, as well as the improvement of the physicomechanical properties of the sonicated epoxy matrices. Some issues of biological modifications of components of polymers for functional application are briefly reviewed.</description>

      <title>Materials and Design Strategies of Fully 3D Printed Biodegradable Wireless Devices for Biomedical Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printing of bioelectronics offers a versatile platform for fabricating personalized and structurally integrated electronic systems within biological scaffolds. Biodegradable electronics, which naturally dissolve after their functional lifetime, minimize the long-term burden on both patients and healthcare providers by eliminating the need for surgical retrieval. In this study, we developed a library of 3D-printable, biodegradable electronic inks encompassing conductors, semiconductors, dielectrics, thereby enabling the direct printing of fully functional, multi-material, customizable electronic systems in a single integrated process. Especially, conjugated molecules were introduced to improve charge mobility, energy level alignment in semiconducting inks. This ink platform supports the fabrication of passive/active components and physical/chemical sensors making it suitable for complex biomedical applications. Versatility of this system was demonstrated through two representative applications: (i) wireless pressure sensor embedded within biodegradable scaffolds, (ii) wireless electrical stimulators that retain programmable electrical functionality in vivo and degrade post-implantation. This work establishes a foundation of modules for autonomous, biodegradable bioelectronic systems fabricated entirely via 3D printing, with implications for personalized diagnostics, therapeutic interfaces, and transient medical devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall effect with high Chern number in two dimensional ferromagnets Ti2TeSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Chern insulators have emerged as crucial platforms for the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and as such have attracted significant interest in spintronics and topological quantum physics due to their unique coexistence of spontaneous magnetization and nontrivial topological characteristics. Nonetheless, substantial challenges persist in such systems, encompassing spin entanglement and the possession of only one edge state (Chern number C=1), which significantly hinder their practical applications. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional ferromagnetic half-semi-Weyl-metal, monolayer Ti2TeSO, that exhibits exceptional electronic properties. Its majority spin channel possesses only a pair of symmetry-protected Weyl points at the Fermi level, while the states of minority one locate far away from the Fermi level. When spin-orbit coupling is included, a substantial band gap of ~ 92.8 meV is induced at the Weyl points. Remarkably, the emergence of dual dissipationless chiral edge channels and a quantized Hall conductivity plateau at 2e2/h collectively establish monolayer Ti2TeSO as a high-Chern-number insulator with C=2. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that valley polarization can be achieved and controlled through the application of strain and the manipulation of the direction of magnetization. The first-principles calculations, in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations, yield a Curie temperature of 161 K for monolayer Ti2TeSO, thereby indicating the plausibility of coexistence of valley polarization and topological states at elevated temperatures. These findings could provide a foundation for the development of multi-channels dissipationless transport devices and nonvolatile multistate memory architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ short-ranged $\textit{Ans\"atze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Ultrahigh-Conductivity Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.</description>

      <title>PDRL: Post-hoc Descriptor-based Residual Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learning Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.</description>

      <title>Effect of $\Gamma_7$ and $\Gamma_8$ Hybridizations on Three-Channel Kondo Phase Emerging from Ho Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing a numerical renormalization group method, we analyze a seven-orbital impurity Anderson model for Ho$^{3+}$ ion with ten $4f$ electrons. This model includes both $V_7$ and $V_8$, which are hybridizations between localized $4f$- and conduction electrons in $\Gamma_7$ and $\Gamma_8$ orbitals, respectively. For the case of $V_7=V_8$ with the local $\Gamma_5$ triplet ground state, we have reported the discovery of a three-channel Kondo (TCK) phase, characterized by a residual entropy of $\log \phi$ with the golden ratio $\phi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. In this research, by depicting the ground-state phase diagram on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane, we attempt to unveil the effect of $V_7$ and $V_8$ on the emergence of the TCK phase. After performing a lot of numerical calculations, we find that the TCK phase appears in a relatively wide region on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane. The boundary curves surrounding the TCK phase are determined by the variation of the temperature dependence in entropy and the abrupt change in energy spectra. We consider that most of the phases surrounding the TCK phase are Fermi liquids, but the non-Fermi liquid two-channel Kondo phase is unexpectedly found to exist next to the TCK phase. Finally, we briefly comment on the actual material concerning the detection of the TCK phase.</description>

      <title>High-$Q$ membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality-factor ($Q$) mechanical resonators are essential components for precise sensing and control of mechanical motion at a quantum level. While amorphous materials such as SiN have been widely used in high-$Q$ mechanical resonators utilizing stress-induced dissipation dilution, crystalline materials have emerging potential to achieve higher quality factors by combining low intrinsic loss and high tensile stress. In this paper, we demonstrate high-Q membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN. Our membrane resonator exhibits a tensile stress exceeding 2.3 GPa and a quality factor of $Q = 8.0 \times 10^6$ at 2.2 K. By estimating the dilution factor, we infer that our TiN resonator has a intrinsic quality factor comparable to that of SiN membrane resonators. With its ultra-high stress and crystalline properties, our TiN films can serve as a powerful tool for opto- and electromechanical systems, offering highly dissipation-diluted mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Observation of surface superconductivity in bulk polycrystalline MoS2 induced by electric double-layer doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of electric-field-induced superconductivity on the surface of bulk polycrystalline MoS2 using electric double-layer doping. A gate voltage applied in an ionic liquid environment systematically increased carrier density, leading to an insulator-to-metal transition and a sharp resistance drop at low temperatures, indicating superconductivity. The onset temperature of superconductivity strongly depended on carrier density inferred from conductance, showing a significant increase and eventual saturation. Unlike prior studies limited to single-crystalline MoS2, our results demonstrate that superconductivity can also be electrostatically induced in polycrystalline systems, broadening the scope for exploring gate-controlled superconductivity in a wider range of materials.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-accelerated search of superconductors in B-C-N based compounds and R3Ni2O7-type nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor research has traditionally depended on experiments and theoretical approaches. However, the rapid advancement of data-driven methods and machine learning (ML) has opened avenues for accelerating superconductor discovery. Here, we integrated ML with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently screen conventional B-C-N based superconductors and identify potential high-TC candidates among R3Ni2O7-type bilayer nickelates. We identified 12 new binary and ternary B-C-N based superconductors with TC &gt;= 10 K, including 3 with TC &gt;= 25 K, such as two structural forms of B2CN (TC = 44.8 K and 41.5 K) and TiNbN2 (TC = 26.2 K). These materials share a common feature of strong {\sigma}-bonds, which is key to achieving relatively high TC. Moreover, we proposed Tb3Ni2O7 (TC = 61.6 K) and Ac3Ni2O7 (TC = 70.3 K) as potential high-TC nickelate superconductors under high pressure. Their electronic structures closely resemble those of La3Ni2O7, especially in the hole-type band dominated by Ni-3dz2 orbital character. We also analyzed feature importance in the ML results for both conventional and high-TC superconductors. These results advance the search for new superconductors and enhance the fundamental understanding of superconducting mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Glass Transition of Percolated Polymers from the Perspective of Thermal Volume Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1995, the Nobel Price winner P.W. Anderson made the following remarkable statement: The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and glass transition. Although there have been new theoretical developments in the meantime, in our opinion, this situation has only improved marginally to date. One of the main reasons is the insufficient consideration of experimental boundary conditions. A central experimental problem arises from the fact that the time constants required to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium increase sharply in the vicinity of and above a hypothetical static glass transition. If these equilibrium conditions are violated, additional internal thermodynamic variables come into play that normally alter the static and dynamic susceptibilities significantly and thus lead to misinterpretations of the experimental data. This raises, for example, the question of whether there are static property changes during the canonical glass transition and how these correlate with dynamic precursors. In this article, we attempt to find answers to these questions using a new experimental method called temperature-modulated optical refractometry in combination with the temperature-jump technique. The total time required to investigate the glass transition behaviour of our model epoxy was approximately two years.</description>

      <title>Ab initio spin Hamiltonians and magnetism of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the crystal-field splitting, ground-state Kramers doublet and intersite exchange interactions within the ground-state doublet manifold using an ab initio Hubbard-I based approach for a representative set of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds. These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing</title>

Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</description>

      <title>Parquet theory for molecular systems. I. Formalism and static kernel parquet approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insulating altermagnets like MnTe exhibit spin configurations where opposing spins are not only aligned antiparallel but also rotated relative to each other. This is an arrangement reminiscent of antiferromagnetism with a twist of spin canting. This study investigates a model Hamiltonian that captures the essential physics of such systems, incorporating key interactions including Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and conventional exchange terms, relativistic spin-orbit coupling, and d-wave and g-wave orderings. Non-Hermitian dynamics are introduced through complex potentials that simulate energy dissipation and amplification. The paper delves into the behavior of the quantum geometric tensor and the emergence of the quantum anomalous Hall effect within the topologically insulating regime. It also broadens the scope to encompass non-Hermitian metallic altermagnets, focusing on phases characterized by symmetry-breaking d-wave and g-wave order parameters.</description>

      <title>Integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and experimental TDPAC approach enlightening the $aftereffects$ phenomenon: probing electronic properties in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$:$^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd) at the atomic scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process have stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and checked experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</description>

      <title>Signatures of emergent surface states across a displacive topological phase transition in Bi$_4$I$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions involving crystalline symmetry breaking provide a fertile ground to explore the interplay between symmetry, topology, and emergent quantum phenomena. Recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional topological material, Bi$_4$I$_4$, has been predicted to host topologically non-trivial gapless surfaces at high temperature, which undergo a finite temperature phase transition to a low temperature gapped phase. Here we present experimental signatures of this room temperature phase transition from a high-temperature $\beta$-phase with a surface state to a gapped $\alpha$-phase hosting hinge states. Using real-space current mapping and resistance fluctuation spectroscopy, we identify signatures of a displacive topological phase transition mediated by a first-order thermodynamic structural change. Near the emergence of $\beta$-phase, we observe pronounced telegraphic noise, indicating fluctuating phase domains with topological surface states. The spatially resolved current map reveals electron transport via the gapless surface states in the $\beta$-phase, which vanishes upon transitioning to the $\alpha$-phase with localized conduction channels (or hinge modes). Our experimental results, supported by first principles estimates and effective theory of a topological displacive phase transition, establish Bi$_4$I$_4$ as a candidate material showing intricate interplay of classical thermodynamic phase transitions with topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of possible spin supersolid states in triangular lattice compounds, we study the dynamical properties of various ground states in the spin-1/2 easy-axis antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with impurities under magnetic fields, using numerical Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods. For both spin supersolid states in the low and high fields, the gapless Goldstone mode at the $K$ points remains robust with impurities, which is related to the presence of spin superfluidity. As a comparison, we find a splitting of magnon band at the same impurity density level in the conventional magnetic state, the so-called up-up-down state. In addition, the finite superfluid stiffness probed by the twisted phase in the spin supersolid states is consistent with the excitation spectrum. We argue that this excitation spectrum with impurity provides direct evidence of the dissipationless dynamics in the spin supersolid states, which could be tested in neutron scattering experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a finite-strain version of an established three-dimensional constitutive model for polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMA) that is able to account for the large deformations and rotations that SMA components may undergo. The model is constructed by applying the logarithmic strain space approach to the original small-strain model, which was formulated within the Generalized Standard Materials framework and features a refined dissipation (rate) function. Additionally, the free energy function is augmented to be more versatile in capturing the transformation kinetics. The model is implemented into finite element software. To demonstrate the model performance and validate the implementation, material parameters are fitted to the experimental data of two SMA, and two computational simulations of SMA components are conducted. The applied approach is highly flexible from the perspective of the future incorporation of other phenomena, e.g., irreversibility associated with plasticity, into the model.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>

Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Switching of the N\'{e}el Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: N\'{e}el vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of N\'{e}el vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that N\'{e}el vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. Unlike previously studied spin torques induced by uniform or staggered spin accumulations -- where either the field-like or damping-like component dominates exclusively -- the asymmetric spin torque features cooperative contributions from both components, leading to N\'{e}el vector dynamics that are fundamentally distinct from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced N\'{e}el vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

Abstract: The Raman scattering regarding the circularly-polarized incident and scattered lights is closely related to the circular activity of a given system. We investigate the symmetry of its activity, called the cross-circular and parallel-circular Raman optical activity. The analysis is systematically performed with the magnetic point groups and indicates that the response allows for a useful diagnosis of the symmetry of materials like chirality and (magneto-)axiality. It is also shown that the Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are related to each other by the conserved antiunitary symmetry for the time-reversal operation and that combined with the mirror reflection.</description>

      <title>Learning Reaction-Diffusion Kinetics from Mechanical Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central challenge in materials science is characterizing chemical processes that are elusive to direct measurement, particularly in functional materials operating under realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Origin of Glass-like Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline TlAgTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered crystalline compounds exhibiting ultralow and glass-like thermal conductivity are both fundamentally and technologically important, where phonon quasi-particles dominate their heat transport. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms that govern such unusual transport behavior is necessary to unravel the complex interplay of crystal structure, phonons, and collective excitations of these quasi-particles. Here, we use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on quantum density functional theory to investigate the origin of experimentally measured unusually low and glassy thermal conductivity in semiconducting TlAgTe. Utilizing a unifying framework of anharmonic lattice dynamics theory that combine phonon self-energy induced frequency renormalization, particle-like Peierls ($\kappa_{l}^{P}$) and wave-like coherent ($\kappa_{l}^{C}$) thermal transport contributions including three and four-phonon scattering channels, we successfully explain the experimental results both in terms of magnitude and temperature dependence. Our analysis reveals that TlAgTe exhibits several localized phonon modes arising from concerted rattling-like vibration of Tl atoms, which show strong temperature dependence and enhanced four-phonon scattering rates that are dominated by Umklapp processes, suppressing $\kappa_{l}^{P}$ to ultralow values. The ensuing strong anharmonicity induced by local structural distortions, lone-pair electrons, and rattling-like vibrations of the heavy cations lead to a transition from particle-like behavior to wave-like tunneling characteristics of the phonon modes above 40 cm$^{-1}$, contributing significantly to $\kappa_{l}^{C}$ which increases with temperature. Our analysis uncovers important structure-property relationship, which may be used in designing of novel materials with tunable thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Selection in Parity-Forbidden Electronic Transitions Revealed by Mn4+ Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in solids.</description>

      <title>Non-Ferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transition in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ via Rapid Thermal Annealing Induced Nitrogen Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies are often essential for stabilizing the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase in HfO$_2$, with cationic doping widely employed to introduce such defects. In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at 900~$^\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spin liquid behavior in the frustrated three-dimensional $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a dynamical regime emerges, characterized by a dual response in the inelastic spectrum composed of short-live dispersive excitations and a quasi-elastic component. Strongly frustrated exchange interactions combined with subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects are a plausible mechanism to explain the origin of this spin-liquid behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in Ruddlesden-Popper phases of bulk nickelates has sparked great interest in stabilizing ambient pressure superconductivity in thin-film form using epitaxial strain. Recently, signs of superconductivity have been observed in compressively strained bilayer nickelate thin films with an onset temperature exceeding 40 K, albeit with broad and two-step-like transitions. Here, we report intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization, and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements for which we suggest suitable materials, most promisingly the material group $X$Mo$_3$S$_3$ ($X$ = Rb, K, Cs).</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multi-gap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the impact of multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) on the multiple superconducting gaps remains not fully understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the multi-orbital electronic structure and superconducting gap properties of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals exhibit strong coupling to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the Sb-5pz orbitals show weak coupling to the out-of-plane vibrations of both Cs and the apical Sb atoms. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly nonconvex granular particles, such as staples and metal shavings, can form solid-like cohesive structures through geometric entanglement (interlocking). The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms.</description>

Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>
