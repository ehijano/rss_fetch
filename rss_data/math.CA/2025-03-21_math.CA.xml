      <title>Finiteness of the H\"{o}lder-Brascamp-Lieb Constant Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract H\"{o}lder-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities have become a ubiquitous tool in Fourier analysis in recent years, due in large part to a theorem of Bennett, Carbery, Christ, and Tao (2008,2010) characterizing finiteness of the H\"{o}lder-Brascamp-Lieb constant. Here we provide a new characterization of a substantially different nature involving directed graphs of subspaces. Its practical value derives from its complementary nature to the Bennett, Carbery, Christ, and Tao conditions: it creates a means by which one can establish finiteness of the H\"{o}lder-Brascamp-Lieb constant by analysis of a well-chosen, finite list of subspaces rather than by checking conditions on all subspaces of the underlying vector space. The proof is elementary and is essentially an "explicitization" of the semi-explicit factorization algorithm of Carbery, H\"{a}nninen, and Valdimarsson (2023).</description>

      <title>Nonempty interior of pinned distance and tree sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a compact set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$, consider the pinned distance set $\Delta^{y}(E)=\lbrace |x-y| : x\in E\rbrace$. Peres and Schlag showed that if the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is bigger than $\frac{d+2}{2}$ with $d\geq 3$, then there exists a point $y\in E$ such that $\Delta^{y}(E)$ has nonempty interior. In this paper we obtain the first non-trivial threshold for this problem in the plane, improving on the Peres--Schlag threshold when $d=3$, and we extend the results to trees using a novel induction argument.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials in the spherical ensemble with two insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider planar orthogonal polynomials $P_{n,N}$ with respect to the weight $$\frac{|z-w|^{NQ_1}}{(1+|z|^2)^{N(1+Q_0+Q_1)+1}}, \quad(Q_0,Q_1 &gt; 0)$$ in the whole complex plane. With $n, N\rightarrow\infty$ and $N-n$ fixed, we obtain the strong asymptotics of the polynomials, and asymptotics for the weighted $L^2$ norm and the limiting zero counting measure. These results apply to the pre-critical phase of the underlying Coulomb gas system, when the equilibrium measure is simply connected. Our method relies on specifying the mother body of the two-dimensional potential problem. It relies too on the fact that the planar orthogonality can be rewritten as a non-Hermitian contour orthogonality. This allows us to perform the Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis of the associated $2\times 2$ Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of Fourier interpolation formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying new functional analysis tools in the framework of Fourier interpolation formulas, such as sc-Fredholm operators and Schauder frames, we are able to improve and refine several properties of these aforementioned formulas on the real line.
  As two examples of our main contributions, we highlight: (i) that we may upgrade perturbed interpolation bases all the way to the Schwartz space, which shows that even the perturbed interpolation formulas are as regular as the Radchenko-Viazovska case; (ii) that a certain subset of the interpolation formulae considered by Kulikov-Nazarov-Sodin may actually be upgraded to be convergent in the Schwartz class, giving a first partial answer to a question posed by those authors.
  As a final contribution of this work, we also show that, if the perturbations are sufficiently small, then even analyticity properties of the basis functions are preserved. This shows, in particular, that any function that vanishes on all but finitely many of the (perturbed) nodes is automatically analytic, a feature previously only known to hold in supercritical contexts besides the Radchenko-Viazovska case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics and zeros of a special family of Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a family of non-classical Jacobi polynomials with varying parameters of the form $\alpha_n=n+1/2$ and $\beta_n=-n-1/2$. We obtain global asymptotics for these polynomials, and use this to establish results on the location their zeros. The analysis is based on the Riemann Hilbert formulation of Jacobi polynomials derived from the non-hermitian orthogonality introduced by Kuijlaars, et al. This family of polynomials arise in the symbolic evaluation integrals in the work of Boros and Moll and corresponds to a limitting case, which is not considered in the works of Kuijlaars, et al. A remarkable feature in the analyisis is encountered when performing the local analysis of the RHP near the origin, where the local parametrix introduces a pole.</description>

      <title>New curved Kakeya estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give new lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of Kakeya sets built from various families of curves in $\mathbb R^3$, going beyond what the polynomial partitioning method has so-far achieved. We do this by combining Wolff's classical hairbrush argument with a new incidence bound for 3-parameter families of curves which satisfy conditions we call coniness and twistiness. Our main argument builds off a technique of Katz, Wu, and Zahl used in the study of $\rm{SL}_2$-Kakeya sets.</description>

      <title>Complex oscillations of non-definite Sturm-Liouville problems, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We correct and update a result of R.G.D. Richardson [13] dealing with the separation of zeros of the real and imaginary parts of non-real eigenfunctions of non-definite Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems. We then extend it to the case where the weight function is allowed to be identically zero on a subinterval that excludes the end-points and study the behavior of the zeros of the real and imaginary parts when the end-points are included. Examples are given illustrating the sharpness of the results along with open questions.</description>

      <title>Exceptional projections in finite fields: Fourier analytic bounds and incidence geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of bounding the number of exceptional projections (projections which are smaller than typical) of a subset of a vector space over a finite field onto subspaces. We establish bounds that depend on $L^p$ estimates for the Fourier transform, improving various known bounds for sets with sufficiently good Fourier analytic properties. The special case $p=2$ recovers a recent result of Bright and Gan (following Chen), which established the finite field analogue of Peres--Schlag's bounds from the continuous setting.
  We prove several auxiliary results of independent interest, including a character sum identity for subspaces (solving a problem of Chen), and an analogue of Plancherel's theorem for subspaces. These auxiliary results also have applications in affine incidence geometry, that is, the problem of estimating the number of incidences between a set of points and a set of affine $k$-planes. We present a novel and direct proof of a well-known result in this area that avoids the use of spectral graph theory, and we provide simple examples demonstrating that these estimates are sharp up to constants.</description>

      <title>Prescribed projections and efficient coverings by curves in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Davies efficient covering theorem states that an arbitrary measurable set $W$ in the plane can be covered by full lines so that the measure of the union of the lines has the same measure as $W$. This result has an interesting dual formulation in the form of a prescribed projection theorem. In this paper, we formulate each of these results in a nonlinear setting and consider some applications. In particular, given a measurable set $W$ and a curve $\Gamma=\{(t,f(t)): t\in [a,b]\}$, where $f$ is $C^1$ with strictly monotone derivative, we show that $W$ can be covered by translations of $\Gamma$ in such a way that the union of the translated curves has the same measure as $W$. This is achieved by proving an equivalent prescribed generalized projection result, which relies on a Venetian blind construction.</description>

      <title>Convex waves grazing convex obstacles to high order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper [WW23] we studied the transport of oscillations in solutions to linear and some semilinear second-order hyperbolic boundary problems along rays that graze a convex obstacle to any order. We showed that high frequency exact solutions are well approximated in $H^1$ by much simpler approximate solutions constructed from explicit solutions to profile equations. That result depends on two geometric assumptions, referred to here as the grazing set (GS) and reflected flow map (RFM) assumptions, that are both difficult to verify in general. The GS assumption states that the grazing set, that is, the set of points on the spacetime boundary at which incoming characteristics meet the boundary tangentially, is a codimension two, $C^1$ submanifold of spacetime. The second is that the reflected flow map, which sends points on the spacetime boundary forward in time to points on reflected and grazing rays, is injective and has appropriate regularity properties near the grazing set. In this paper we analyze these assumptions for incoming plane, spherical, and more general ``convex waves" when the governing hyperbolic operator is the wave operator $\Box:=\Delta-\partial_t^2$. We prove general results describing when the assumptions hold, and provide explicit examples where the GS assumption fails.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Graham about the Sylvester's sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{u_n\}$ be the Sylvester's sequence (sequence A000058 in the OEIS), and let $ a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \cdots $ be any other positive integer sequence satisfying $ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{a_k} = 1 $. In this paper, we solve a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, which asks whether $$ \liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n^{\frac{1}{2^n}} &lt; \lim_{n\to\infty} u_n^{\frac{1}{2^n}} = c_0 = 1.264085\ldots. $$ We prove this conjecture using a constructive approach. Furthermore, assuming that the unproven claim of Erd\H{o}s and Graham that "all rationals have eventually greedy best Egyptian underapproximations" holds, we establish a generalization of this conjecture using a non-constructive approach. [This paper solves Problem 315 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>
