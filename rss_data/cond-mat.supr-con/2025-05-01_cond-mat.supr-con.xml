      <title>Superfluid Weight of Inhomogeneous Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the expression, within the linear response approximation, of the superfluid weight of a superconductor, taking into account the response of the superconductor's pairing potential to the perturbing vector potential. We find that, in general, the correction is non-zero when the system is spatially non-uniform. We apply the formula to two exemplary cases: the case when strong inhomogeneities in the pairing potential are induced by a periodic potential, and the case when superconducting vortices are induced by an external magnetic field. For both cases we show that the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the paring potential to the perturbing vector potential can be significant, it must be included to obtain quantitatively correct results, and that for the case when vortices are present the expression of the superfluid weight that does not include such correction returns qualitatively wrong results.</description>

      <title>Josephson Diode Effect from Nonequilibrium Current in a Superconducting Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in a superconducting interferometer under nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast to its thermodynamic counterpart, which requires the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, we demonstrate that a diode-like asymmetry of the critical current can emerge solely due to a dissipative current in the normal region of an otherwise symmetric Josephson junction. This effect is driven entirely by the nonequilibrium conditions, without the need for additional inversion symmetry breaking. Using the standard quasiclassical Keldysh Green's function formalism, we explicitly calculate the diode coefficient from the supercurrent-phase relation of the interferometer. Remarkably, within certain ranges of control parameters, such as applied voltage, temperature, and the geometric aspect ratio of the device, the diode coefficient can exceed its nominal perfect value.</description>

      <title>Dominant apical-oxygen electron-phonon coupling in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How electron-phonon interactions influence high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains contested, and their role outside the CuO$_2$ planes has been largely overlooked. The most conspicuous evidence for such coupling is the ubiquitous 70-meV dispersion kink seen by photoemission, yet its microscopic origin is still debated. Here we use oxygen-$K$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223). When both incident photon energy and polarization are tuned to the apical-oxygen $1s\!\rightarrow\!2p_z$ transition, the RIXS spectra exhibit a ladder of at least ten phonon overtones, evenly spaced by 70 meV, whose intensities follow a Franck-Condon envelope, signalling exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling. Quantitative modelling that incorporates core-hole lifetime evaluation yields an apical-phonon coupling energy of 0.25(1) eV, significantly larger than that of the planar stretching mode. Such a coupling strength offers a strong contender for explaining the universal 70-meV kink and suggests that the dominant electron-phonon channel resides outside the CuO$_2$ planes. By elevating inter-layer lattice dynamics from a peripheral factor to a central actor, our results provide a fresh starting point for theories seeking to reconcile strong correlations, lattice dynamics and high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the physical properties of (LaS)1+d(NbS2) misfit-layered compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical transport in polycrystalline and single-crystalline (LaS)1+d(NbS2) misfit-layered compounds was measured. Polycrystalline samples were synthesized using S raw materials of different purities (2N or 6N), and single-crystalline samples were grown using two types of transport agents (2NH4Cl+PbCl2 or NH4Cl) via the chemical vapor transport method. The temperature dependence on resistivity dropped at 1.3-2.0 K for some of the samples, which might be affected by the unknown impurity. (LaS)1+d(NbS2) misfit-layered compounds for the main phase of those obtained samples exhibited no superconductivity above 0.2 K by the resistivity measurement.</description>

      <title>A$_1$-A$_2$ splitting in pure $^3$He in nematic aerogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present the results of vibrating wire experiments in pure $^3$He (without $^4$He coverage) in nematic aerogel. We investigated the dependence of splitting of the superfluid transition temperature of $^3$He in aerogel on magnetic field. In addition to our previous work, we used a wider range of magnetic fields (up to 31 kOe) and managed to detect both the "upper" and "lower" superfluid transition temperatures. The solid paramagnetic $^3$He layer on the aerogel strands activates the magnetic scattering channel. According to theory, it should result in linear splitting at high ($\ge20$ kOe) fields, while at lower fields the splitting is expected to be nonlinear. We were able to observe this nonlinearity, but we have a discrepancy with theoretical predictions regarding the range of fields where nonlinearity occurs. Possible reasons for this are discussed.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant optical excitation of apical-oxygen phonon modes in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ has been shown to induce superconducting-like optical properties at temperatures far higher than the equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into an inductive response, reminiscent of a superconducting state, an assignement that was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties. These experiements have so far been challenging because of the high in-plane equilibrium reflectivity, from which small changes in the optical response determine the transient conductivity. We observe a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, also consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Planckian scattering and parallel conduction channels in the iron chalcogenide superconductors FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable linear in temperature resistivity of the cuprate superconductors, which extends in some samples from $T_c$ to the melting temperature, remains unexplained. Although seemingly simple, this temperature dependence is incompatible with the conventional theory of metals that dictates that the scattering rate, $1/\tau$, should be quadratic in temperature if electron-electron scattering dominates. Understanding the origin of this temperature dependence and its connection to superconductivity may provide the key to pick the lock of high-temperature superconductivity. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) we elucidate the low temperature conducting behavior of two FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ (FTS) samples, one with almost equal amounts of Se and Te that is believed to be a topological superconductor, and one that is more overdoped. Constrained with DC resistivity, we find two conduction channels that add in parallel, a broad one in frequency with weak temperature dependence and a sharper one whose scattering rate goes as the Planckian limited rate, $\sim kT/h$. Through analysis of its spectral weight we show the superconducting condensate is mainly drawn from the channel that undergoes this Planckian scattering.</description>

      <title>Disorder induced topological phase transition in a driven Majorana chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a periodically driven one dimensional Kitaev model in the presence of disorder. In the clean limit our model exhibits four topological phases corresponding to the existence or non-existence of edge modes at zero and pi quasienergy. When disorder is added, the system parameters get renormalized and the system may exhibit a topological phase transition. When starting from the Majorana $\pi$ Mode (MPM) phase, which hosts only edge Majoranas with quasienergy pi, disorder induces a transition into a neighboring phase with both pi and zero modes on the edges. We characterize the disordered system using (i) exact diagonalization (ii) Arnoldi mapping onto an effective tight binding chain and (iii) topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Chirped amplitude mode in photo-excited superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Field-free superconducting diode effect in layered superconductor FeSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), where zero-resistance states appear nonreciprocally during current injection, is receiving tremendous interest in both fundamental and applied physics because the SDE is a novel manifestation of symmetry breaking and enables the creation of a novel diode. In particular, magnetic-field-free SDEs have been extensively investigated because of their potential to serve as building blocks for superconducting circuit technology. In this letter, we report the field-free SDE in a layered superconductor, FeSe. Its underlying physics is clarified by systematic controlled experiments to be an interplay of a large thermoelectric response and geometrical asymmetry in FeSe. Our findings can pave a new avenue for the construction of novel material and device platforms utilizing SDEs.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconductivity from kinetic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity is usually assumed to arise from attractive interaction. In this work we show that strong pairing is possible soley from kinetic energy even without a net attraction. We demonstrate a high-temperature kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with nearest-neighbor hopping ($t$) projected onto a constrained Hilbert space, analogous to the $t$-$J$ model with $J=0$, where kinetic magnetism has been previously studied. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) on cylinders up to width $L_y=8$, we find a superconducting ground state exhibiting a key difference from high-$T_c$ cuprates: both the pairing gap and phase stiffness \textit{increase} with doping ($x$). We find pairing gaps, determined from spin and single-electron charge gaps, exceeding $1.5t$. This model can be realized within the double Kondo lattice model, relevant to bilayer nickelates, in the limit of strong inter-layer spin coupling ($J_\perp/t \rightarrow +\infty$) and a balancing inter-layer repulsion ($V$). Importantly, the double Kondo model does not fundamentally restrict $J_\perp/t$, suggesting the potential for high critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching $0.5t$. While this idealized limit predicts large pairing gaps, we show a smooth connection to the more realistic regime with $J_\perp \sim t$, albeit with a reduced pairing gap of approximately $0.1t$. Assuming $t \sim 10^3$ K in typical solid state systems, our model suggests the exciting possibility of achieving $T_c$ of hundreds of Kelvin. We propose searching for bilayer materials with reduced out-of-plane lattice constants to better approximate the conditions of our ideal model.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits comprising Josephson junctions have spurred significant research activity due to their promise to realize scalable quantum computers. Effective Hamiltonians for these systems have traditionally been derived assuming the junction connects superconducting islands of infinite size. We derive a quantized Hamiltonian for a Josephson junction between finite-sized islands and predict measurable corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility to test the theory.</description>
