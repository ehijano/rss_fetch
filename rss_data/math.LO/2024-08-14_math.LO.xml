      <title>Recognizable Realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of realizability with ordinal Turing machines based on recognizability rather than computability, i.e., the ability to uniquely identify an object. We show that the arising concept of $r$-realizabilty has the property that all axioms of Kripke-Platek set theory are $r$-realizable and that the set of $r$-realizable statements is closed under intuitionistic provability.</description>

      <title>Tame pairs of transseries fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns pairs of models of the theory of the differential field of logarithmic-exponential transseries that are tame as a pair of real closed fields. That is, the smaller model is bounded inside the larger model and there exists a standard part map. This covers for instance the differential fields of hyperseries or surreal numbers or maximal Hardy fields equipped with suitable enlargements of the differential field of transseries. The theory of such pairs is complete and model complete in a natural language and it has quantifier elimination in the same language expanded by two predicates and a standard part map. Additionally, the smaller model is purely stably embedded in the pair, and hence so is the constant field.
  More generally, we study differential-Hensel-Liouville closed pre-$H$-fields, i.e., pre-$H$-fields that are differential-henselian, real closed, and closed under exponential integration, equipped with lifts of their differential residue fields, and establish similar results in that setting relative to the differential residue field.</description>

      <title>Categorical Framework for Typed Extensional and Intensional Models in Formal Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensional computation derives concrete outputs from abstract function definitions; extensional computation defines functions through explicit input-output pairs. In formal semantics: intensional computation interprets expressions as context-dependent functions; extensional computation evaluates expressions based on their denotations in an otherwise fixed context. This paper reformulates typed extensional and intensional models of formal semantics within a category-theoretic framework and demonstrates their natural representation therein. We construct $\textbf{ModInt}$, the category of intensional models, building on the categories $\textbf{Set}$ of sets, $\textbf{Rel}$ of relations, and $\textbf{Kr}$ and $\textbf{Kr}_\textbf{b}$ of Kripke frames with monotone maps and bounded morphisms, respectively. We prove that trivial intensional models are equivalent to extensional models, providing a unified categorical representation of intensionality and extensionality in formal semantics. This approach reinterprets the relationship between intensions and extensions in a categorical framework and offers a modular, order-independent method for processing intensions and recovering extensions; contextualizing the relationship between content and reference in category-theoretic terms. We discuss implications for natural language semantics and propose future directions for contextual integration and exploring $\textbf{ModInt}$'s algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>State-based Modal Logics for Free Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML), a modal logic employing state-based semantics (also known as team semantics), which has been used to account for free choice inferences and related linguistic phenomena. This logic extends classical modal logic with a nonemptiness atom which is true in a state if and only if the state is nonempty. We introduce two extensions of BSML and show that the extensions are expressively complete, and develop natural deduction axiomatizations for the three logics.</description>

      <title>Noetherian theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first-order theory is Noetherian with respect to the collection of formulae $\mathcal{F}$ if every definable set is a Boolean combination of instances of formulae in $\mathcal{F}$ and the topology whose subbasis of closed sets is the collection of instances of arbitrary formulae in $\mathcal{F}$ is Noetherian. Noetherianity is a strengthening of equationality, which itself implies stability. We show the Noetherianity of the theory of proper pairs of algebraically closed fields in any characteristic.</description>

      <title>Game semantics for lattice-based modal {\mu}-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize modal $\mu$-calculus to the non-distributive (lattice-based) modal $\mu$-calculus and formalize some scenarios regarding categorization using it. We also provide a game semantics for the developed logic. The proof of adequacy of this game semantics proceeds by generalizing the unfolding games on the power-set algebras to the arbitrary lattices and showing that these games can be used to determine the least and the greatest fixed points of a monotone operator on a lattice. Finally, we define a notion of bisimulations on the polarities and show invariance of non-distributive modal $\mu$-calculus under them.</description>
