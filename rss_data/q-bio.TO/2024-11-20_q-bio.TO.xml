      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for durable tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for computational pathology identifies model limitations and tissue biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03080</link>

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning models hold great promise for digital pathology, but their opaque decision-making processes undermine trust and hinder clinical adoption. Explainable AI methods are essential to enhance model transparency and reliability. Methods: We developed HIPPO, an explainable AI framework that systematically modifies tissue regions in whole slide images to generate image counterfactuals, enabling quantitative hypothesis testing, bias detection, and model evaluation beyond traditional performance metrics. HIPPO was applied to a variety of clinically important tasks, including breast metastasis detection in axillary lymph nodes, prognostication in breast cancer and melanoma, and IDH mutation classification in gliomas. In computational experiments, HIPPO was compared against traditional metrics and attention-based approaches to assess its ability to identify key tissue elements driving model predictions. Results: In metastasis detection, HIPPO uncovered critical model limitations that were undetectable by standard performance metrics or attention-based methods. For prognostic prediction, HIPPO outperformed attention by providing more nuanced insights into tissue elements influencing outcomes. In a proof-of-concept study, HIPPO facilitated hypothesis generation for identifying melanoma patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. In IDH mutation classification, HIPPO more robustly identified the pathology regions responsible for false negatives compared to attention, suggesting its potential to outperform attention in explaining model decisions. Conclusions: HIPPO expands the explainable AI toolkit for computational pathology by enabling deeper insights into model behavior. This framework supports the trustworthy development, deployment, and regulation of weakly-supervised models in clinical and research settings, promoting their broader adoption in digital pathology.</description>
