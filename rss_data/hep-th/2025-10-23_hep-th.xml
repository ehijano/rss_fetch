      <title>Flow-geometry microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct geometric microstates for a class of two-dimensional flow geometries$-$spacetimes that interpolate from an asymptotic AdS$_2$ boundary to a dS$_2$ static patch in the interior$-$by inserting particles behind the horizon. We show that this mechanism produces dS microstates with an Einstein-Rosen bridge of infinite length behind the horizon. The state-counting of these microstates, including wormhole contributions, reproduces the Gibbons-Hawking entropy, $S_{\rm dS}=A^{\rm dS}_{\rm horizon}/4G$. Furthermore, we extend the microstate-counting method to the case of a finite-length Einstein-Rosen bridge. As a result, the Hilbert space of the dS horizon in the flow geometry can be spanned by states with a purely dS Einstein-Rosen bridge, containing no AdS portion on the time-symmetric slice. This provides a concrete realization of dS microstates within a controlled holographic framework.</description>

      <title>de Sitter no-go's for Riemann-flat manifolds and a link to semidefinite optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a no-go theorem in the context of string and M-theory flux compactifications on Riemann-Flat manifolds with Casimir energy. Specifically, we show that no dS minimum exists in this setup in dimension $d&gt;3$. The case of dS$_3$ minima is not excluded, but their actual fate can only be ascertained via an explicit construction. We also point out that the problem of finding dS minima on RFM's and more general flux compactifications is mathematically equivalent to a semidefinite programming problem, identical to those studied in CFT bootstrap, and hence the search for dS can benefit from the existing vast literature and numerical tools. We illustrate this in a toy model.</description>

      <title>Frozen Firewall: Generic Singularity Formation on an Extremal Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that linearized perturbations of extremal black holes result in growing curvature on the horizon. However, nonlinear perturbations typically do not evolve to extremal black holes and do not have growing curvature at late times. We show that a large class of nonlinear perturbations of an extremal planar anti-de Sitter black hole does have horizon curvature that grows unbounded in time. The late time behavior of the nonlinear evolution is found to be captured by a linearized analysis. We argue that the generic nonlinear perturbation behaves similarly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new tunneling solution for the decay of a cosmic string into a burst of gravitational waves. We find the relevant instanton and compute the tunneling rate. Locally, our solution is just an analytic continuation of the Kerr metric (but there is no black hole in our solution). An interesting feature of our result is that there is a conical singularity in the initial state but there is no singularity in the final state. This demonstrates that singularities can disappear in quantum gravity in ways that are impossible in classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson causality and non-Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical lattice models with local, bounded interactions obey Lieb-Robinson causality. We show that this implies a domain of analyticity of the retarded Green's function $G^R(\omega,{\bf k})$ of local lattice operators as a function of complex frequency $\omega$ and momentum ${\bf k}$, similar to the lightcone analyticity property of relativistic field theories. Low-energy effective descriptions of the dynamics must be consistent with this microscopic analyticity constraint. We consider two canonical low-energy fermionic Green's functions describing non-Fermi liquids, the marginal Fermi liquid and the `Hertz liquid'. The pole in these Green's functions must be outside of the Lieb-Robinson domain of analyticity for all complex momenta captured by the low-energy theory. We show that this constraint upper bounds the magnitude of the dimensionless non-Fermi liquid coupling in certain Hertz liquids. We furthermore obtain, from causality, an upper bound on the magnitude $|G^R(\omega,{\bf k})|$ within the analytic domain. We use this bound to constrain the quasiparticle residue of the non-Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Geometric Symmetries for the Vanishing of the Black Hole Tidal Love Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric perspective on the symmetries underlying the spin 0, 1 and 2 static perturbations around a Schwarzschild black hole. In all cases, the symmetries are exact, each forming an SO(3,1) group. They can be formulated at the level of the action, provided the appropriate field variables are chosen. For spin 1 and 2, the convenient variables are certain combinations of the gauge fields for even perturbations, and dual scalars for odd perturbations. The even and odd sector each has its own SO(3,1) symmetry. In addition, there is an SO(2) symmetry connecting them, furnishing an economical description of Chandrasekhar's duality. When decomposed in spherical harmonics, the perturbations form a non-trivial representation of SO(3,1), giving rise to ladder symmetries which explain the vanishing of the tidal Love numbers. Our work builds on earlier discussions of ladder symmetries, which were formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar at the level of the Teukolsky equation. Our formulation makes it possible to state the symmetries responsible for the vanishing of the Wilson coefficients characterizing the spin 0, 1 and 2 static tidal response, in the effective point particle description of a black hole.</description>

      <title>One-loop double copy from gravity coupled to a massive vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the one-loop four-graviton amplitudes with a massive abelian vector field (Proca) circulating in the loop. Instead of the conventional Einstein-Hilbert formulation, we employ the Landau-Lifshitz metric density approach, coupling gravity to the Proca field. Within this framework, we found that the resulting contact-terms-free $n$-gon numerators exhibit a manifest double-copy structure, provided the external gravitational trees satisfy this property. This structure enables the direct construction of the corresponding amplitudes with a scalar in the loop. We further show that these numerators can be consistently used to evaluate pure gravity amplitudes in the sectors where contact terms vanish, offering a simplified setting to explore double-copy relations at one loop level.</description>

      <title>On the stabilizer complexity of Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of Hawking radiation for an evaporating black hole from the perspective of the stabilizer theory of quantum computation. Specifically, we calculate Wigner negativity -- a magic monotone which can be interpreted as a measure of the stabilizer complexity, or equivalently, the complexity of classical simulation -- in various toy models for evaporating black holes. We first calculate the Wigner negativity of Hawking radiation in the PSSY model directly using the gravitational path integral, and show that the negativity is $O(1)$ before the Page transition, but becomes exponentially large past the Page transition. We also derive a universal, information theoretic formula for the negativity which interpolates between the two extremes. We then study the Wigner negativity of radiation in a dynamical model of black hole evaporation. In this case, the negativity shows a sharp spike at early times resulting from the coupling between the black hole and the radiation system, but at late times when the system settles down, we find that the negativity satisfies the same universal formula as in the PSSY model. Finally, we also propose a geometric formula for Wigner negativity in general holographic states using intuition from fixed area states and random tensor networks, and argue that a python's lunch in the entanglement wedge implies a stabilizer complexity which is exponentially large in $\frac{1}{8G_N}$ times the difference between the areas corresponding to the outermost and minimal extremal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Gaillard-Zumino non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover an infinite class of novel zero-form non-invertible symmetries in a broad family of four-dimensional models, studied years ago by Gaillard and Zumino (GZ), which includes several extended supergravities as particular subcases. The GZ models consist of abelian gauge fields coupled to a neutral sector, typically including a set of scalars, whose equations of motion are classically invariant under a continuous group $\mathscr{G}$ acting on the electric and magnetic field strengths via symplectic transformations. The standard lore holds that, at the quantum level, these symmetries are broken to an integral subgroup $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Z}$. We show that, in fact, a much larger subgroup $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ survives, albeit through non-invertible topological defects. We explicitly construct these defects and compute some of their fusion rules. As illustrative examples, we consider the axion-dilaton-Maxwell model and the bosonic sector of a class of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities of the kind that appear in type II Calabi-Yau compactifications. Finally, we comment on how (part of) these non-invertible zero-form symmetries can be broken by gauging the $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Z}$ subgroup of invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quintic Ginzburg-Landau Description of the $(2,7)$ Minimal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss dimensional continuation of the massless scalar field theory with the $i\phi^5$ interaction term. It preserves the so-called $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, which acts by $\phi\rightarrow -\phi$ accompanied by $i\rightarrow -i$. Below its upper critical dimension $10/3$, this theory has interacting infrared fixed points. We argue that the fixed point in $d=2$ describes the non-unitary minimal conformal model $M(2,7)$. We identify the operators $\phi$ and $\phi^2$ with the Virasoro primaries $\phi_{1,2}$ and $\phi_{1,3}$, respectively, and $i\phi^3$ with a quasi-primary operator, which is a Virasoro descendant of $\phi_{1,3}$. Our identifications appear to be consistent with the operator product expansions and with considerations based on integrability. Using constrained Pad\'e extrapolations, we provide estimates of the critical exponents in $d=3$. We also comment on possible lattice descriptions of $M(2,7)$ and discuss RG flows to and from this CFT. Finally, we conjecture that the minimal models $M(2, 2n+1)$ are described by the massless scalar field theories with the $i\phi^{2n-1}$ interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Center vortices and the emergence of a gluon mass scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice simulations and theoretical analyses consistently identify center vortices and monopoles as key nonperturbative configurations in Yang-Mills theory. Independently, studies of correlation functions reveal an infrared behavior characterized by massive-like scales. Yet, an open issue is how such correlators can arise in a confining regime characterized by a linearly rising potential rather than a Yukawa one. Using an Abelian-projected vacuum wavefunctional peaked on chains formed by center vortices and monopoles, we compute gauge-invariant field-strength correlators. We show the emergence of a massive-like correlator constructed from the gauge-invariant two-point field strength observable. This behavior arises from the nonoriented soft component of the center-vortex condensate, the same hierarchical mechanism previously shown to produce the area law and Casimir scaling of string tensions.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Gauge Theories: Yang-Mills extensions and beyond - An overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The status of several representative gauge theories on various quantum space-times, mainly focusing on Yang-Mills type extensions together with a few matrix model formulations is overviewed. The common building blocks are derivation based differential calculus possibly twisted and noncommutative analog of the Koszul connection. The star-products related to the quantum space-times are obtained from a combination of harmonic analysis of group algebras combined with Weyl quantization. The remaining problems inherent to gauge theories on Moyal spaces in their two different formulations are outlined. A family of gauge invariant matrix models on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$, a deformation of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is presented among which a solvable model. The characterization of 11 new quantum Minkowski space-times through their $*$-algebras is given. A gauge theory of Yang-Mills type is constructed on one recently explored of these space-times and compared to its counterpart built on the popular $\kappa$-Minkowski.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mass generation and critical behavior in pseudo-Proca quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the dynamical mass generation for fermions in pseudo-Proca QED, which represents an effective theory in (2+1)D arising from the dimensional reduction of the Proca Lagrangian, where the interaction is mediated by a gauge field with finite mass $m$. Using the Schwinger-Dyson equations within the rainbow approximation, we study both quenched and unquenched regimes. We determine the critical coupling $\alpha_c(m,\Lambda)$ and the critical number of fermion flavors $N_c(m,\Lambda)$ that govern chiral symmetry breaking. We also examine the criticality in the anisotropic case, where fermions propagate with a Fermi velocity $v_F\neq c$. These results could be useful for understanding quantum criticality in low-dimensional systems and engineered platforms with tunable interactions.</description>

      <title>Podolsky quantum electrodynamics for strongly coupled Dirac fermions in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Podolsky quantum electrodynamics (POQED), a higher-derivative extension of QED in (3+1)D, and perform its dimensional reduction to (2+1)D by confining the Dirac current to a plane while allowing the gauge field to propagate out of the plane. The resulting model, which we call Pseudo Generalized QED (PGQED), is minimally coupled to massless Dirac fermions. In the strong-coupling regime, we show that a dynamical mass is generated through approximate solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equation, leading to chiral symmetry breaking and modifications of the fermion dispersion relation. We derive an analytic critical coupling $\alpha_{c}(\mu)$ and flavors critical number $N_{c}(\mu)$, dependent on the Podolsky parameter $\mu$ and the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$. These analytical results are found to be consistent with the numerical analysis. Finally, we discuss connections to graphene, estimating a range for $\mu$ in the ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Large N Universality of 4d N=1 SCFTs with Simple Gauge Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories with a simple gauge group admitting a large $N$ limit that flow to non-trivial superconformal fixed points in the infrared. We focus on the cases where the large $N$ limit can be taken while keeping the flavor symmetry fixed so that the putative holographic dual has a fixed gauge group. We find that they can be classified into three types -- Type I, Type II, and Type III -- exhibiting universal behavior. Type I theories have $a \neq c$ in the large $N$ limit and scale linearly in $N$; the gap of scaling dimensions among BPS operators behaves as $1/N$. Type II theories have $a=c$ in the large $N$ limit, and satisfy $a \simeq c \simeq \frac{27}{128} \dim G$, and Type III theories have $a \simeq c \simeq \frac{1}{4} \dim G$. For Type II and Type III theories, the gap of scaling dimensions stays $O(1)$ in the large $N$ limit. We enumerate relevant and marginal operators of these theories and find that non-trivial conformal manifolds emerge upon relevant deformations. Moreover, we find that a modified version of the AdS Weak Gravity Conjecture, based on the supersymmetric Cardy formula, holds for all of these theories, even for finite $N$.</description>

First we prove that bosonic and fermionic T-dualization commute using already known T-dual transformation laws for bosonic and fermionic T-dualization. Consequently, the T-dual transformation laws of the full T-dualization are obtained. At the end the full T-dualization is realized in double space and it is showed that Buscher procedure and double space approach are equivalent in this specific case.</description>

      <title>4d Maxwell on the Edge: Global Aspects of Boundary Conditions and Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Maxwell theory in 4d with a boundary, with particular attention to the global properties of the boundary conditions, both in the free (topological) and interacting (conformal) cases. We analyze the fate of Wilson-'t Hooft lines, identifying the subset that is trivialized on the boundary and the ones that become topological, thus generating a boundary 1-form symmetry. We further study how the boundary conditions are mapped to each other by 3d topological interfaces implementing bulk dualities and rescalings of the coupling. Together, these interfaces generate an $SL(2,\mathbb{Q})$ action on the bulk complexified coupling $\tau$, and they generalize the usual $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ action on 3d CFTs by including both topological and non-topological manipulations within a unified framework. We then show how to recover our results in a streamlined way from a SymTFT picture in 5d with corners. Finally, we comment on the possible inclusion of non-compact 3d edge modes.</description>

      <title>Large-$N$ limit of $O(N)^3$-invariant general sextic tensor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sextic tensor model where the interaction terms are given by all $O(N)^3$-invariant bubbles. The class of invariants studied here is thus a larger one that the class of the $U(N)^3$-invariant sextic tensor model. We implement the large $N$ limit mechanism for this general model and we explicitly identify the dominant graphs in the $1/N$ expansion. This class of dominant graphs contains tadpole graphs, melonic graphs but also new types of tensor graphs. Our analysis adapts the tensorial intermediate field method, previously applied only to the prismatic interaction, to all connected sextic interactions except the wheel interaction, which we treat separately using a cycle analysis.</description>

      <title>Fermionic fields of higher spin in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fermionic fields of higher spin on a four-dimensional de Sitter background. A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered, and their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In Lorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions, and the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the Minkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are placed on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at one-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of unitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections. The unitary nature of the characters contrasts the lack of a conventional real action for the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in de Sitter space. We speculate on the microscopic properties of a theory comprised of an infinite tower of interacting integer and half-integer gauge fields in de Sitter space. Along the way, we discuss a potentially interesting expression for the higher-spin path integral on the four-sphere.</description>

      <title>Landscape of Narain CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the AdS$_{3}$ gravitational bulk dual to an ensemble of Narain CFTs and their generalisations to establish bounds consistent with the Swampland program. Focusing on the AdS distance and finiteness conjectures, we show that the central charge of Narain CFTs forming the ensemble must be finite. Combining anomaly and unitary requirements, we derive an upper bound on the rank of the abelian U(1) gauge symmetries that can consistently couple to the AdS$_{3}$ gravity. We give explicit realisations of these constraints by determining the range of the Chern-Simons level $k^{G}$ corresponding to a bounded AdS$_{3}$ radius$.$ Accordingly, the Narain landscape is finite with a number of admissible CFTs constrained as $3/2\lesssim c\lesssim 10^{3}.$</description>

      <title>M5 branes on ADE singularities: BPS spectrum and partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a stack of M5 branes probing a transverse multi-centered Taub-NUT space are described by a class of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theories known as the M-string orbifold SCFTs. We determine the equivariant partition functions for this class of theories on a geometric background of type $T^2\times\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma \in\{\mathcal{C}_N,\mathcal{Q}_N, \mathcal{T},\mathcal{O},\mathcal{I}\}$ is an arbitrary finite subgroup of $SU(2)$. The partition functions are built out of contributions from BPS strings as well as BPS particles that arise upon putting the 6d theory on a circle. We find that BPS particle contributions can be expressed in terms of $\Gamma$-covariant Hilbert series which count holomorphic sections of vector bundles on the orbifold singularity with monodromy specified by an irreducible representation of $\Gamma$. The BPS string contributions, on the other hand, are given by the elliptic genera of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ $\Gamma$-dressed quiver gauge theories, obtained by stacking Kronheimer-Nakajima quivers of type $\Gamma$ between interfaces that support current algebras for the McKay dual affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We obtain explicit expressions for the elliptic genera of arbitrary BPS string configurations corresponding to fractional instanton strings on $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$, and for the case of star-shaped quivers of type $\Gamma\in\{\mathcal{Q}_4,\mathcal{T},\mathcal{O},\mathcal{I}\}$ we give a prescription to compute the elliptic genera by gluing 2d analogues of Gaiotto and Witten's $T[SU(N)]$ theories.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=1$ super complex Liouville string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the (type 0B) $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric complex Liouville string ($\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$), a supersymmetric extension of the bosonic complex Liouville string ($\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$). We compute the sphere three-point amplitudes (including NS-NS-NS and NS-R-R types) and find they share the same form as the sphere three-point amplitude of the bosonic $\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$. Analysis of the analytic structure of the NS-NS-NS-NS four-point amplitude and the higher equations of motion also yields results identical to the bosonic case. Based on these findings, we propose that the dual matrix model for the $\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$ is the same as that for the bosonic $\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$. We also investigate a related theory $\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$, which differs in the gauged worldsheet supersymmetry. A parallel analysis is performed for $\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$, and a candidate for its dual matrix model is proposed. We then carry out a partial numerical evaluation of the moduli space integral, which provides further evidence for both the proposals of the dual matrix model regarding $\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$ and $\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Symmetry Operators from Hanging Branes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic realization of topological operators for continuous non-Abelian symmetries in quantum field theories. As a concrete case study, we focus on Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ which admits an $SO(6)$ isometry, dual to the R-symmetry in 4d $N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We argue that symmetry operators for continuous symmetries are generally realized by bound states of D5-branes and KK monopoles hanging from the conformal boundary. Together they account for the contributions to the Gauss' law constraints from the self-dual 5-form flux and the Einstein-Hilbert term respectively. We also demonstrate how the D5-KK bound state measures the representation of the endpoint of Wilson lines constructed by D3-branes.</description>

      <title>Unified Resummation of Soft Gluon Radiation in Heavy Meson Pair Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified resummation framework for heavy-meson pair photoproduction that treats soft-gluon radiation in a massive scheme for $|\boldsymbol q| \lesssim m_Q$ and is consistent with the massless limit $m_Q \ll |\boldsymbol q|$, where $\boldsymbol q$ denotes the transverse momentum of the pair and $m_Q$ the quark mass. This framework describes the full correlation regime $|\boldsymbol q| \ll |\boldsymbol P|$, with $\boldsymbol P$ the pair's relative transverse momentum. Next, within the Color Glass Condensate framework, we quantify the impact of soft gluon radiation on two important phenomenological observables, namely, the azimuthal $\Delta\phi$ correlation and the harmonic asymmetries $\langle \cos(2n\phi_{qP})\rangle$. Our results show that the resummation provides an excellent description of the H1 $\Delta\phi$ data. We then find that the angular-asymmetry harmonics are sizable and their ratios in $\gamma A$ to $\gamma p$ collisions are highly sensitive to gluon saturation. We further find a clear mass hierarchy in both observables, indicating that heavy-quark masses suppress soft radiation and thereby enhance genuine small-$x$ saturation signals. Our work demonstrates that heavy-quark pair photoproduction provides a quantitative probe of gluon saturation, directly measurable in forthcoming EIC and UPC measurements. Finally, the unified resummation is readily extendable to other processes involving massive particles and jets in both $eA$ and $pA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Clearing up the Strong $CP$ problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) constrains the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theta angle to be less than one part in ten billion, posing the Strong $CP$ problem. We revisit two classes of proposed solutions. First, we show that when $P$ or $CP$ is realized as a gauged discrete symmetry - as can arise in quantum gravity - the vacuum necessarily preserves $CP$, contrary to recent claims that discrete-symmetry solutions fail. Gauged discrete models face model-building challenges, such as avoiding contributions to the neutron EDM after spontaneous $P$ or $CP$ breaking, but in principle have no fundamental obstructions. Second, we critically examine recent arguments that the Strong $CP$ problem is illusory, demonstrating that a nonzero neutron EDM at finite $\bar\theta$ follows directly from well-understood QCD dynamics. Taken together, our results reinforce the reality of the Strong $CP$ problem and highlight gauged discrete-symmetry realizations of $P$ or $CP$ as plausible solutions.</description>

      <title>Beyond quasinormal modes: a complete mode decomposition of black hole perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that retarded Green's functions of black hole spacetimes can be expressed as a convergent mode sum everywhere in spacetime. At late times a quasinormal mode sum converges, while at early times a Matsubara (or, Euclidean) mode sum converges. The two regions are separated by a lightcone which scatters from the black hole potential. The Matsubara sum is a Fourier series on the Euclidean thermal circle associated to the early time region. We illustrate our results for P\"oschl-Teller, BTZ, and Schwarzschild. In the case of Schwarzschild, we express the branch cut contribution as a convergent sum of de Sitter quasinormal modes as $\Lambda\to 0^+$, and exploit recent exact solutions to the Heun connection problem. In each case we analytically show convergence by studying the asymptotics of residue sums and also provide numerical demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Spurion Analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_M/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Non-Invertible Selection Rules: Low-Order versus All-Order Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the spurion analysis of non-invertible selection rules (NISRs) arising from near-group fusion algebras, we further generalize the framework to a class of NISRs obtained from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolding of a $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetry, denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_M/\mathbb{Z}_2$. Many structural features are carried over: for instance, our labeling scheme enables systematic tracking of all couplings when constructing composite amplitudes from simpler building blocks at arbitrary loop orders in perturbation theory. Our analysis provides a transparent understanding of both low-order and all-order zeros of couplings under radiative corrections. Furthermore, we examine the fate of low-order zeros when the fusion algebra is not faithfully realized -- a situation not captured by the vanilla argument of ``loop-induced groupification'' -- and formulate a conjecture on the related aspects of particle decoupling and effective theory. Finally, we discuss the low-order versus all-order zeros in Yukawa textures from the perspective of spurion analysis.</description>

      <title>Stellar cooling limits on KK gravitons and dark dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, as arise in the dark dimension scenario, considering red giants, neutron stars, and supernovae. In addition to bremsstrahlung, we account for two novel production channels: resonant mixing with the in-medium photon and a pion-induced process in supernovae. The strongest limits arise from SN 1987A, with the emissivity from the pion process exceeding that from bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few. Given present uncertainties, we obtain a bound on the KK mass scale of $m_{\rm KK}\gtrsim 0.6\,{\rm eV}$ $(\gtrsim 500\,{\rm eV})$ for 2 (3) extra dimensions. Improved understanding of the properties of pions in supernovae could strengthen these limits to roughly ${\rm eV}$ $({\rm keV})$. For 1 extra dimension, the bounds are weaker than those from laboratory searches. We also show that constraints from KK graviton decays to Standard Model particles are less stringent than the cooling bounds if there is KK number violation at the level typically assumed in the dark dimension scenario, although these bounds could be strengthened by future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a 3-manifold $M$, and a branched cover arising from the projection of a Lagrangian 3-manifold $L$ in the cotangent bundle of $M$ to the zero-section, we define a map from the skein of $M$ to the skein of $L$, via the skein-valued counting of holomorphic curves. When $M$ and $L$ are products of surfaces and intervals, we show that wall crossings in the space of the branched covers obey a skein-valued lift of the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula.
  Holomorphic curves in cotangent bundles correspond to Morse flow graphs; in the case of branched double covers, this allows us to give an explicit formula for the the skein trace. After specializing to the case where $M$ is a surface times an interval, and additionally specializing the HOMFLYPT skein to the $\mathfrak{gl}(2)$ skein on $M$ and the $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ skein on $L$, we recover an existing prescription of Neitzke and Yan.</description>

      <title>Nearly Monochromatic Primordial Black Holes as total Dark Matter from Bubble Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network renormalization group with entanglement filtering in two and three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering. Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both 2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity Under Hamiltonian Deformations and Toda Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a complex system can be efficiently described in Krylov space, the minimal subspace in which the dynamics unfolds. We apply the Krylov subspace method for Hamiltonian deformations, which provides a systematic way of constructing solvable models from known instances. In doing so, we relate the evolution of deformed and undeformed theories and investigate their complexity. For a certain class of deformations, the resulting Krylov subspace is unchanged, and we observe time evolutions with a reorganized basis. The tridiagonal form of the generator in the Krylov space is maintained, and we obtain generalized Toda equations as a function of the deformation parameters. The imaginary-time-like evolutions can be described by real-time unitary ones. As possible applications, we discuss coherent Gibbs states for thermodynamic systems, for which we analyze the survival probability, spread complexity, Krylov entropy, and associated time-averaged quantities. We further discuss the statistical properties of random matrices and supersymmetric systems for quadratic deformations.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Noncommutative Carrollian Geometry via Lie-Rinehart Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carroll manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of the $O(2)$-invariant $\phi^4$ theory with a cubic perturbation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $2$-component $\phi^4$ model on the simple cubic lattice in the presence of a cubic, or equivalently, a $\mathbb{D}_4$ invariant perturbation. To this end, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in conjunction with a finite size scaling analysis of the data. We follow previous work on the $3$-component case. We study the RG flow from the decoupled Ising fixed point into the $O(2)$-invariant one and towards the fluctuation induced first order transition. To this end we study the behavior of phenomenological couplings. At the $O(2)$-invariant fixed point we obtain the estimate $Y_4=-0.1118(10)$ of the RG-exponent of the perturbation. Note that the small modulus of $Y_4$ means that the RG flow is slow. Hence, in order to interpret experiments or Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models, which are effectively described by the $\phi^4$ model with a cubic term, we have to consider the RG flow beyond the neighborhood of the fixed points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, expanding on previous analyses, we employ an effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the mass spectrum of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperature, above the (pseudo-)critical temperature $T_c$, in a "realistic" $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavor scenario with degenerate $up$ and $down$ quarks and a heavier $strange$ quark: $0 &lt; m_u = m_d \ll m_s$. The model's predictions are then critically compared with available lattice QCD results (where meson screening masses are extracted from chiral susceptibilities, which correspond to two-point correlation functions of suitable interpolating operators), looking, in particular, for signatures of the breaking of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry above $T_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite local operators are central to effective field theories (EFTs), as they define interaction vertices in effective Lagrangians and play a fundamental role in investigating the structure of quantum field theories. The contribution of high-dimensional operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) grows increasingly important as experimental precision improves at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in future colliders. However, the number of operators increases very rapidly with dimension, making it extremely challenging to identify their complete set. In our previous work \cite{Jin:2020pwh}, we proposed a systematic method for generating gluonic operators using primitive operators. In this paper, we introduce a graphical representation of gluonic operators and, based on this representation, present a method to systematically construct primitive operators. Using this method, we derive primitive operators corresponding to gluonic operators of length 2 to length 7 in $D$-dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a metastable state decays into radiation, there must be entanglement between the radiation and the decaying system, as well as between radiation collected at late and early times. We study the interplay between these two types of entanglement in simple Gaussian models. We define, via a windowed Fourier transform, multimode quantum states associated with radiation fragments produced at different times and compute the corresponding entanglement entropy increments. On the basis of these results, we argue that such entropy increments are useful entanglement measures, especially in cases, such as Hawking radiation, where one wishes to separate the radiation into ``old'' and ``new.''</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use holography to study correlation functions of local operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories arising on the world-volume of D$p$-branes in the large-$N$ and strong-coupling limit. The relevant supergravity backgrounds obtained from the near-horizon limit of the D$p$-branes enjoy a scaling similarity, which leads to an auxiliary AdS space of fractional dimension. This suggests that holographic correlation functions in this setup can be computed by integrating standard CFT correlators over the auxiliary extra dimensions. We apply this prescription to analytically compute two- and three-point correlators of scalar operators. The resulting two-point functions take a familiar CFT form but with shifted conformal dimensions, while the three-point correlators have a much more involved position dependence which we calculate explicitly in terms of a sum of Appell functions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Correlators Beyond Maximal Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to explicitly calculate some of the three-point functions in the planar limit of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Leigh-Strassler SCFT. This strongly interacting CFT can be obtained as a mass deformation of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and admits a dual description in terms of an AdS$_5$ background of type IIB supergravity. Our analysis is based on the existence of a consistent truncation of the 10d supergravity to a tractable 5d gravitational theory with 10 scalar fields dual to some of the low-lying operators in the spectrum of the LS SCFT. We apply standard holographic techniques to this 10-scalar model to analytically calculate the correlators of interest and thus provide a rare example of explicit three-point functions of scalar non-BPS operators in strongly coupled 4d CFTs. Using superconformal Ward identities we perform several consistency checks of these holographic correlators. As a byproduct of our analysis we discuss some subtleties related to the calculation of extremal correlators in AdS/CFT and the contribution of scalar derivative couplings to the evaluation of Witten diagrams. Our work provides a blueprint for the holographic calculation of other correlators in the LS SCFT and similar top-down holographic models.</description>

      <title>Chiral non-Abelian domain walls in the Ginzburg-Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study chiral non-Abelian domain walls in a phase of unconventional vacua of the Ginzburg-Landau model for dense QCD, by considering a wider range of parameters space not directly deduced from QCD. The phase is characterized by asymmetric vacuum-expectation values (VEVs), for example with the left scalar field, corresponding to the left quark-quark condensate, having a nonvanishing VEV and the right field having a vanishing one. The domain wall soliton interpolates between this vacuum and another where the left and right scalar fields switch roles. We study this formal possibility, but not any mechanism to generate these vacua non-perturbatively at finite density or finite temperature. Using a strong-coupling, or sigma-model limit, we are able to reduce the full dynamical complex matrix valued equations of motion to the sine-Gordon, a generalization of the sine-Gordon and a generalization of the double sine-Gordon equations. In this limit, we prove nonexistence of domain walls in one of the vacua studied here and we find full numerical computations to converge to the sigma-model limit for many cases, with some exceptions that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Stationary Solution to Charged Hairy Black Hole in AdS4: Kasner Interior, Rotating Shock Waves, and Fast Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stationary solution of a charged black hole with scalar hair in AdS$_4$, where the scalar field is coupled to a $U(1)$ Maxwell gauge field. Near the singularity, the spacetime transitions into a more general Kasner geometry. The black hole is then injected with rotating and charged gravitational shock waves in the Dray-'t Hooft solution. These shock waves lengthen the wormhole connecting the two asymptotic boundaries, thereby disrupting the correlations between them. The correlation, quantified by the quantum mutual information between subregions on the left and right boundaries, vanishes at a characteristic timescale known as the scrambling time, which depends logarithmically on the black hole entropy. The mutual information is computed holographically using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for entanglement entropy. We investigate how the rotation and charge of both the black hole and the shock waves affect chaotic properties such as the scrambling time delay and the Lyapunov exponent. The interaction between the charges of the black hole and the shock waves introduces a delay in the scrambling process. We find that as the strength of the boundary deformation increases, both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay decrease monotonically. Furthermore, the angular momentum of the shock waves enhances both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider holographic entanglement entropy in AdS black hole backgrounds by using the limit of large number of dimensions. By dividing the geometry to two patches (with one patch covering the vicinity of the black hole horizon and another covering the other regions), we are able to obtain fully analytic expressions for the entropy when the entanglement region is a strip. We argue that apart from conformal field theories at finite temperature in high number of dimensions, our method works for nearly critical theories in 3+1 dimensions. In the case of extremal black holes, dual to quantum critical systems, the results take a particularly simple form. We also comment on the case of soliton geometries. Finally, we analyze entanglement entropy for wide strips, and propose a general formula for the first subleading term in the expansion of the entropy in (inverse) system size for generic entanglement regions.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gravitational constant at low energies from the connection between spin-2 and spin-0 sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01449</link>

Abstract: The fact that graviton propagator contains not only one but two tensorial components excludes a unique definition of the running behavior of the gravitational constant, while at low energies gravitation is characterized solely by Newton's constant. How these two facts are reconciled when massive quantum fields are present remains unanswered. In this work, by non-minimally coupling gravity to a one-loop massive scalar, we show that this potential conflict is resolved by the non-trivial equivalence between the residues of the two propagator components. Such equivalence, crucial for the validity of the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, is based on a rather subtle connection between the spin-2 and spin-0 sectors of the propagator. It is verified that this connection also makes the two quantum-corrected gravitational potentials be characterized by the same gravitational constant at large distances. In addition, we find that the potentials in our case as well as the quantum-corrected Coulomb potential can be expressed concisely in a unified formulation. By comparing these results with experiments, we establish a new upper bound on the magnitude of the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$.</description>

      <title>Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed ''deep boundary criticality''. Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Non-Locality in Particle Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality, providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Radiation from Derivative-Coupled Atoms Falling in Modified Gravity Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of quantum detector models with fields in curved spacetimes provides fundamental insights into phenomena such as Hawking and Unruh radiation. While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between the detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which are sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the context of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general framework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic detector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral expression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct spacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we demonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the precise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon. For a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the radiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct correspondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with the modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative coupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal coupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive probe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide distinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>The non-minimal 3-form cosmology and the rise of the cuscuton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the 3-form theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity in an expanding Universe. First, we assume that the background is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the three-form is coupled to both the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor. We show that in this case, it propagates three degrees of freedom: a scalar mode and two tensor ones. Then, we consider an anisotropic background that corresponds to a Bianchi Type I Universe, and set the coupling with the Ricci tensor to zero. We show that, similarly to the Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity, this case leads to two branches for the background solutions - depending on the values of the 3-form. However, in contrast to the Proca case, we show that no extra modes appear. We explore the no-ghost conditions and speed of propagation for all three modes in both branches. Finally, we show that one of the branches can be written as a theory of a constrained scalar, coupled to a cuscuton field.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Strings in $E_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d{-}1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p{+}1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d{-}p{-}2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product, symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the bipartite entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. The framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the factorization, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>
