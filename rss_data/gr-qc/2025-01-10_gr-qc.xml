      <title>Yang-Mills-Utiyama Theory and Graviweak Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report provides a geometrical Yang-Mills theory, including gravity. The theory treats the space-time symmetry of the local Lorentz group in the same manner as the internal gauge symmetry. We extend this general relativistic Yang-Mills theory in the Minkowski space-time to a broader space, including Euclidean and Minkowskian spaces. In the extended space, we can transport topological achievements from the Euclidean Yang-Mills theory into the Lorentzian Yang-Mills theory. This extension also provides a relation between space-time and internal symmetry. The perspective provided by the extended theory suggests the novel relation between gravity and the weak force, leading us to the graviweak correspondence.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of black holes in perfect fluid dark matter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the universal thermodynamic topological classes of a family of black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Recent research on black hole thermodynamics suggests that all black holes can be classified into four universal thermodynamic classes, denoted by $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Our study reveals that the Schwarzschild black hole in PFDM belongs to the $W^{1-}$ class, and independence of black hole size thermodynamically unstable at both low- and high-temperature limits. The Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman black holes in the PFDM background belong to the same universal thermodynamic class, $W^{0+}$, which represents small, stable black holes and large, unstable black holes at low-temperature limits, whereas no black hole state exists at high temperatures. The AdS black holes behave differently compared to their counterparts in PFDM. The Schwarzschild-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{0-}$ class, indicating no black hole state at low temperatures, but small, unstable and large, stable black hole states at high temperatures. Furthermore, the Kerr-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{1+}$ class, characterized by small, stable black holes at low temperatures, large, stable black holes at high temperatures, and unstable, intermediate-sized black holes at both low and high temperatures. These findings uncover the universal topological classifications underlying black hole thermodynamics, offering profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of quantum matter bounces with dark sector mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of the inclusion of fluids In bounce scenarios driven by an exponential potential scalar field. Most solutions exhibit well known tracking behavior between the fluids and the scalar field. This tracking behavior can model transitions between different phases of cosmic evolution. We will focus on an interesting bouncing model with a dust matter fluid, where the scalar field can drive an early dark energy expanding period with a radiation-like dominated phase just after it, and then tracks the dust matter fluid with energy density compatible with the dark matter energy density. The model is dust dominated in the far past of the contracting phase, and has stiff matter behavior when approaching the singularity, allowing well known quantum bounce transitions to the expanding era. Hence, it is a quantum matter bounce scenario with an inflationary phase together with a smooth transition through a radiation era to matter domination with a possible scalar field dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Exact multi-black hole spacetimes in Einstein-ModMax theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact solutions describing multiple, electrically charged black holes (BHs) in a model of non-linear electrodynamics (NLE) minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity are presented. The NLE model is ModMax theory, that has attracted much attention due to its duality and conformal invariance, features shared with standard (linear) electrodynamics. In the non-extremal case, the solution has conical singularities, similarly to the multi Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory. In the extremal case the solution is regular on and outside the event horizon; it is isometric to the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution, albeit the individual BHs have a non-unitary charge to mass ratio, due to screening effects. Using the ModMax electromagnetic duality invariance, magnetically charged and dyonic generalizations are also obtained. Finally, we construct multi-BH solutions with a positive cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Coherence DeepClean: Toward autonomous denoising of gravitational-wave detector data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technical and environmental noise in ground-based laser interferometers designed for gravitational-wave observations like Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA, can manifest as narrow (&lt;1Hz) or broadband ($10'$s or even $100'$s of Hz) spectral lines and features in the instruments' strain amplitude spectral density. When the sources of this noise cannot be identified or removed, in cases where there are witness sensors sensitive to this noise source, denoising of the gravitational-wave strain channel can be performed in software, enabling recovery of instrument sensitivity over affected frequency bands. This noise hunting and removal process can be particularly challenging due to the wealth of auxiliary channels monitoring the interferometry and the environment and the non-linear couplings that may be present. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis approach and corresponding cyberinfrastructure to promptly identify and remove noise in software using machine learning techniques. The approach builds on earlier work (referred to as DeepClean) in using machine learning methods for linear and non-linear regression of noise. We demonstrate how this procedure can be operated and optimized in a tandem fashion close to online data taking; it starts off with a coherence monitoring analysis that first singles out and prioritizes witness channels that can then be used by DeepClean. The resulting denoised strain by DeepClean reflects a 1.4\% improvement in the binary neutron star range, which can translate into a 4.3\% increase in the sensitive volume. This cyber infrastructure we refer to as Coherence DeepClean, or CDC, is a significant step toward autonomous operations of noise subtraction for ground-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>Resummations for Inflationary Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continual production of gravitons during inflation endows loop corrections with secular logarithms which grow nonperturbatively large during a prolonged period of inflation. The physics behind these effects is reviewed, along with a catalog of the examples which have so far been found. Resummation can be accomplished by combining a variant of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism with a variant of the renormalization group. The issue of gauge independence is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the bullet cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS). The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients, by recasting the variation in the temperature as a variation in the metric. Merging the above concept with Einstein's gravity, leads to the theory of thermal gravity in 5-D space-time-temperature. Thermal gravity when generalized for partially thermalized systems, results in the theory of many body gravity. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark matter. However, this work demonstrates that the MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analytic solution to the gravitational-wave overlapping event rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration, posing significant challenges to data analysis. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping events. For the first time we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events to aid rapid and robust estimation. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating in the background provided by a spacetime hosting a strong curvature, naked singularity, are fully studied. The analysis is performed not only in the realm of geometrical optics -- which, not surprisingly, proves to be inadequate in the strong field regime characterizing the vicinity of the singularity -- but also in the physical one in which the field amplitudes must necessarily be incorporated into the description. In addition to the expected divergent outcome with regard to the field amplitudes and power flux as the waves approach the singularity, we found a number of regular (bounded) solutions which seem to coexist with the unbridled effects of the spacetime curvature. In some of them, the singularity operates as a perfect mirror reflecting the surrounding fields. Strikingly, other solutions exhibit a perfectly well behaved, bounded power flux as they propagate towards the singularity, suggesting thus the possibility of having electromagnetic energy transference through it.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. By numerically solving for the zero-modes of spherical bosonic stars under specific axially symmetric perturbations, we discover that excited state spherical bosonic stars bifurcate into two types of axisymmetric bosonic stars under $\ell=2$ perturbations, with matter distributions resembling chains and rings, respectively. Meanwhile, $\ell=4$ axisymmetric perturbations lead spherical scalar bosonic stars to bifurcate into a new type of axisymmetric bosonic stars, exhibiting a mixed chain-like and ring-like matter distribution, which we refer to as gyroscope-like. Additionally, for the first time, we have constructed chains of scalar bosonic stars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar bosonic stars. Our results provide an explanation for the bifurcations in bosonic stars from the perspective of perturbations, and by analyzing physical quantities such as quadrupoles and energy densities we systematically discuss the impact of axisymmetric perturbations on spherical bosonic stars.</description>

      <title>The unitarity crisis, nonviolent unitarization, and implications for quantum spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper overviews the information paradox, or "unitarity crisis," and a proposed resolution called nonviolent unitarization. It begins by examining the conflict of principles yielding the crisis, which can be phrased in terms of a "black hole theorem" which outlines how basic assumptions come into conflict. Proposed resolutions of the conflict, along with problems with them, are overviewed. The very important underlying question of localization of information and its role is discussed at some length, taking into account effects of perturbative gravity. The difficulty in finding a consistent scenario for black hole evolution strongly suggests new interactions on event horizon scales; a "minimal" set of assumptions about these are parameterized in nonviolent unitarization. Possible criticisms of this scenario, and some responses, are given. New interactions at event horizon scales potentially lead to observable effects, via gravitational wave or electromagnetic channels, which are briefly discussed. A possible origin of nonviolent unitarization effects from a more fundamental description of quantum gravity, and possible implications for such a description, are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Consistent Warped $\mathbb R\times T^{1,1}$ Reduction of Heterotic Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a curious duality between the bosonic sector of heterotic supergravity and the noncritical bosonic string with conformal anomaly. This allows us to map the Mink$_4\times S^3\times S^3$ vacuum of the bosonic string to a new warped $\mathbb R\times (T^{1,1}\times$Mink$_4)$ vacuum of the heterotic theory, which turns out to be supersymmetric, preserving $1/4$ of the supersymmetry. We perform consistent dimensional reduction of the heterotic theory on the warped $\mathbb R\times T^{1,1}$ internal space and obtain ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ supergravity, with one complex scalar multiplet and $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Yang-Mills multiplets, where the gauge symmetry is originated from the isometry group of $T^{1,1}$.</description>

      <title>How to Minimize the Decoherence Caused by Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an experimentalist, Alice, who creates a quantum superposition of a charged or massive body outside of a black hole (or, more generally, in the presence of a Killing horizon). It was previously shown that emission of soft photons/gravitons into the black hole will result in the decoherence of the components of the superposition if it is held open for a sufficiently long span of time. However, at any finite time, $t_c$, during the process, it is not obvious how much decoherence has irrevocably occurred. Equivalently, it is not obvious how much information an observer inside the black hole can extract about Alice's superposition prior to time $t_c$. In this paper, we solve for the optimal experimental protocol to be followed by Alice for $t &gt; t_c$ so as to minimize the decoherence of the components of her superposition. More precisely, given the entangling radiation that has passed through the horizon prior to the cross-section $\mathcal C$ corresponding to the time $t = t_c$ in Alice's lab, we determine the "optimal purification" of this radiation beyond $\mathcal C$ such that the global quantum state of the radiation through the horizon has maximal overlap (quantum fidelity) with the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacuum. Due to the intricate low frequency entanglement structure of the quantum field theory vacuum state, we find this optimal purification to be nontrivial. In particular, even if Alice has already "closed" her superposition by bringing the components back together, we find that she can decrease the net decoherence of the components of her superposition somewhat by re-opening it and performing further manipulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from r-mode oscillations of stochastically accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $r$-mode oscillations in rotating neutron stars are a source of continuous gravitational radiation. We investigate the excitation of $r$-modes by the mechanical impact on the neutron star surface of stochastically accreted clumps of matter, assuming that the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability is not triggered. The star is idealised as a slowly-rotating, unmagnetised, one-component fluid with a barotropic equation of state in Newtonian gravity. It is found that the $r$-mode amplitude depends weakly on the equation of state but sensitively on the rotation frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$. The gravitational wave strain implicitly depends on the equation of state through the damping timescale. The root-mean-square strain is $h_{\rm rms} \approx 10^{-35} (\nu_{\rm s}/ 10 {\rm Hz})^{2} (R_*/10 {\rm km})^2 (\Delta t_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm yr})^{1/2} (f_{\rm acc}/1 {\rm kHz})^{-1/2} (\dot{M}/10^{-8} \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}) (v/0.4c) (d/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$, which is comparable to the strain from $g$-, $p$- and $f$-modes excited by stochastic accretion, where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $\Delta t_{\rm acc}$ is the uninterrupted duration of an accretion episode, $f_{\rm acc}$ is the mean clump impact frequency, $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate, $v$ is the impact speed, and $d$ is the distance of the star from the Earth. An observational test is proposed, based on the temporal autocorrelation function of the gravitational wave signal, to discern whether the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability switches on and coexists with impact-excited $r$-modes before or during a gravitational wave observation.</description>

      <title>Harvesting primordial black holes from stochastic trees with $\texttt{FOREST}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on stochastic trees, modelling the inflationary expansion as a branching process. Combined with the $\delta N$ formalism, this allows us to generate real-space maps of the curvature perturbation that fully capture quantum diffusion and its non-perturbative backreaction during inflation. Unlike lattice methods, trees do not proceed on a fixed background since new spacetime units emerge dynamically as trees unfold, naturally incorporating metric fluctuations. The recursive structure of stochastic trees also offers remarkable numerical efficiency, and we develop the FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool and demonstrate its performance. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees, and how their mass distribution can be obtained while automatically accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" effect. In the "quantum-well" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature and discuss several prospects.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum of matter number counts in cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure (LSS), offering insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we derive the theoretical angular bispectrum of number counts for the first time without relying on the Limber approximation, while incorporating redshift binning. Notably, our analysis includes all Newtonian effects, leading relativistic projection effects, and general relativistic contributions, including radiation dynamics, up to second order in perturbation theory. For simplicity, however, we neglect any biasing effects. We have implemented these expressions in an open access code to evaluate the bispectrum for two redshift bins, $z=2 \pm 0.25$ and $z=0.6 \pm 0.05$, and compare our analytical results with simulations. For the contributions that already appear in a Newtonian treatment we find an interesting cancellation between the quadratic terms. At $z=2$, the projection effects and the dynamical effects have similar amplitude on large scales as we approach $k \sim \mathcal{H}$. In the squeezed limit, radiation effects are found to be the leading relativistic effects, by one order of magnitude. At $z=0.6$, we find the correct weak-field hierarchy between the terms, controlled by the ratio $\mathcal{H}/k$, but we still find that dynamical effects (from nonlinear evolution) are only a factor $2-3$ smaller than the projection effects. We compare our results with simulation measurements and find good agreement for the total bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical properties of a deformed Schwarzschild black hole via Dunkl generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a deformed Schwarzschild black hole from the de Sitter gauge theory of gravity within Dunkl generalization and we determine the metric coefficients versus Dunkl parameter and parity operators. Since the spacetime coordinates are not affected by the group transformations, only fields are allowed to change under the action of the symmetry group. A particular ansatz for the gauge fields is chosen and the components of the strength tensor are computed as well. Additionally, we analyze the modifications on the thermodynamic properties to a spherically symmetric black hole due to Dunkl parameters for even and odd parities. Finally, we verify a novel remark highlighted from heat capacity: the appearance of a phase transition when the odd parity is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Superradiant growth anomaly magnification in evolution of vector bosonic condensates bounded by a Kerr black hole with near-horizon reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight vector particles can form evolving condensates around a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability. We study the effect of near-horizon reflection on the evolution of this system: by matching three pieces of asymptotic expansions of the Proca equation in Kerr metric and considering the leading order in the electric mode, we present explicit analytical expressions for the corrected spectrum and the superradiant instability rates. Particularly, in high-spin BH cases, we identify an anomalous situation where the superadiance rate is temporarily increased by the reflection parameter $\mathcal{R}$, which also occurs in the scalar scenario, but is largely magnified in vector condensates due to a faster growth rate in dominant mode. We point out the condition for the growth anomaly in the adiabatic case is that information carried per particle exceeds a certain value $\delta I/\delta N&gt;2\pi k_\text{B} \sqrt{(1+\mathcal{R})/(1-\mathcal{R})}$. We further construct several featured quantities to illustrate it, and formalize the anomaly-induced gravitational wave strain deformation.</description>

      <title>Probing charge of compact objects with gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves (GWs) opens up the exciting possibility of studying the spacetime geometry around the lens. In this work, we investigate the prospects of constraining the `charged' hair of a charged gravitating object from the observation of a GW signal microlensed by the same. The charge can have electromagnetic or modified gravity origin. We compute the analytic form of the lensing potential with charge and construct the lensed waveforms for a range of mass and charge of the charged object, assuming them to be non spinning. Using an approximate likelihood function, we explore how future observations of microlensed GWs can constrain the charge of the lens. We conclude that lensing observations are unlikely to be able to constrain the electromagnetic charge of black holes. However, we might be able to put modest constraints on certain modified gravity models (e.g., the brandworld scenario) or the possibility of the lenses being exotic objects (e.g., naked singularities) .</description>

      <title>Delicate curvature bounces in the no-boundary wave function and in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed. Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces I. Uniqueness and application to Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two papers with sequel [arXiv:2501.03983] where we analyze the transverse expansion of the metric on a general null hypersurface. In this paper we obtain general geometric identities relating the transverse derivatives of the ambient Ricci tensor and the transverse expansion of the metric at the null hypersurface. We also explore the case where the hypersurface exhibits a generalized symmetry generator, namely a privileged vector field in the ambient space which, at the hypersurface, is null and tangent (including the possibility of zeroes). This covers the Killing, homothetic, or conformal horizon cases, and, more generally, any situation where detailed information on the deformation tensor of the symmetry generator is available. Our approach is entirely covariant, independent on any field equations, and does not make any assumptions regarding the topology or dimension of the null hypersurface. As an application we prove that the full transverse expansion of the spacetime metric at a non-degenerate Killing horizon (also allowing for bifurcation surfaces) is uniquely determined in terms of abstract data on the horizon and the tower of derivatives of the ambient Ricci tensor at the horizon. In particular, the transverse expansion of the metric in $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes admitting a non-degenerate horizon is uniquely determined in terms of abstract data at the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze Planck scale induced modifications of the relativistic time dilation using data from the Muon Storage Ring experiment at CERN. By examining the lifetimes of muons, we establish, for the first time, a constraint on such quantum gravity-inspired deformations using this channel. The magnitude of the effect indicates that the study of cosmic rays is a well suited arena for this scenario. We show, that the spectrum of muons would be significantly affected for particles at the PeV scale. Since this later observation of the effect of time dilation is more indirect compared to a direct lifetime measurement, we encourage to perform a high precision measurement of the muon lifetime as a function of the muons energy.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for differentially rotating galaxies in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources is presented. The low-energy asymptotic regime is extracted, requiring a self-consistent coupling of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The Raychaudhuri equation reduces to a balance equation, with two important limits. These limits can be interpreted empirically for rotationally supported configurations such as galaxies. The net energy including quasilocal kinetic contributions vanishes on the inner vortex surface, and the outer rotosurface. These new geometrical objects potentially shed light on virialization. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support previous suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies. The demonstration that general relativity possesses a new alternative low-energy limit different from the conventional post-Newtonian limit may have major consequences for all gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales.</description>

Abstract: We transcribe into the framework of the torsionful version of the {\epsilon}-formalism of Infeld and van der Waerden the world definition of the Weyl tensor for a curved spacetime that occurs in the realm of Einstein-Cartan's theory. The resulting expression shows us that it is not possible to attain any general condition for conformal flatness in such a spacetime even if wave functions for gravitons are eventually taken to vanish identically. A short discussion on the situation concerning the limiting case of general relativity is presented thereafter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Seidov limit is a bound on the maximum latent heat that a presumed first-order phase transition of neutron-star matter can have before its excess energy density, not compensated by additional pressure, results in gravitational collapse. Because latent heat forces an apparent nonanalytic behaviour in plots correlating physical quantities (kinks in two-dimensional, ridges in three-dimensional ones), it can be constrained by data. As the onset of collapse depends on the intensity of gravity, testing for sudden derivative changes and, if they are large, breaching the Seidov limit would reward with two successive discoveries: such a phase transition (which could stem from hadron matter but also from a gravitational phase transition), and a modification of General Relativity (thus breaking the matter/gravity degeneracy). We illustrate the point with $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ metric gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze various phenomena influenced by the gravitational field in a bumblebee gravity solution, with a particular emphasis on a traversable wormhole for massless particle modes. Specifically, we calculate the index of refraction, group velocity, time delay, modified distances, and interparticle potential, demonstrating the possibility of photon-photon interactions due to the wormhole geometry. For the latter aspect, we also extend the analysis to massive particle modes, resulting in a ``combination'' of modified Yukawa- and Couloumb-like potentials. These calculations are shown to be dependent on the wormhole's parameters, particularly the wormhole throat. In addition to these analyses, the Hawking temperature is derived using the trapping horizon method, yielding negative values. Furthermore, we derive the thermodynamic properties of photon-like modes by incorporating the modified dispersion relation arising from the wormhole geometry, focusing on non-interacting particle modes. Remarkably, all calculations are conducted in a fully analytical framework.</description>

Abstract: The challenge of understanding the Universe's dynamics, particularly the Hubble tension, requires precise measurements of the Hubble constant. Building upon the existing spectral-siren method, which capitalizes on population information from gravitational-wave sources, this paper explores an alternative way to analyze the population data to obtain the cosmological parameters in $\Lambda$CDM. We demonstrated how non-parametric methods, which are flexible models that can be used to agnostically reconstruct arbitrary probability densities, can be incorporated into this framework and leverage the detector-frame mass distribution to infer the cosmological parameters. We tested our method with mock data and applied it to $70$ binary black hole mergers from the third gravitational-wave transient catalog of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: This article explores the motion of massive particles in the gravitational field of a modified gravity (MOG) black hole (BH), characterized by the parameter $\alpha$. Using the Hamiltonian formalism, the geodesic equations and the effective potential governing particle trajectories are derived. Key features, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the innermost bound circular orbit (IBCO), are analyzed, revealing their dependence on the particle's energy, angular momentum, and the MOG parameter. In the extremal case, where $\alpha=-1$, the event horizon merges with the Cauchy horizon, forming a distinctive BH configuration. Numerical methods are employed to compute periodic orbits in this spacetime, with a comparison drawn to the Schwarzschild BH. The findings indicate that for $\alpha&gt;0$, periodic orbits around Schwarzschild-MOG BH exhibit lower energy requirements than those in Schwarzschild spacetime, whereas for $-1&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, the energy requirements are higher. Precessing orbits near periodic trajectories are also examined, offering insights into their complex dynamical behavior. Finally, the gravitational wave (GW) radiation from the periodic orbits of a test particle around the Schwarzschild-MOG BH is examined, generating intricate waveforms that provide insights into the gravitational structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models</title>

Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to the changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), introducing quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP or EGUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of GEUP on the analogue of the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within the classical limit of non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted phase space volume element, invariant under the infinitesimal time evolution, in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how GEUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties. Special cases, obtained in certain limits from the above models are discussed. New higher order types of GEUP and EUP are also proposed.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Topology of black hole phase transition in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a JT gravity setup coupled with $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in two dimensions that reveals the onset of a small black hole to large black hole phase transition at finite chemical potential(s). We identify these black hole solutions as topological defects in the thermodynamic phase space and calculate the associated topological numbers following the standard procedure. We confirm the robustness of our model by estimating perturbative corrections to the bulk free energy at an arbitrary order in the Yang-Mills coupling. We also construct the Schwarzian for the boundary theory using the 2D gravitational action in the bulk and comment on the dual SYK like model where similar observations can be made.</description>

      <title>Cosmic censorship in a (dual) collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic censorship in anti-de Sitter space in holographic models in which the ground state is described by a good singularity. These include supersymmetric truncations of string/M-theory, for which a positive-energy theorem holds. At the boundary, our solutions describe a boost-invariant fluid in which the temperature decreases monotonically with time. On the gravity side, they correspond to black-brane spacetimes with a receding horizon. In classical gravity, curvature invariants at the horizon grow without bound. In the full theory this regime may or may not be reached. In some cases it is avoided by a phase transition to a regular geometry. In others it is reached but the boundary hydrodynamic evolution can be continued, provided the equation of state at parametrically small energies is known. Both cases require the inclusion of finite-$N$ or finite-coupling effects.</description>
