      <title>LLM impact on BLV programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to a wide range of tools, tasks, and problem-solving processes, especially in software development. Originally designed for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, LLMs are increasingly being used to assist both professionals and students in writing code. This growing reliance on LLM-based tools is reshaping programming workflows and task execution. In this study, we explore the impact of these technologies on blind and low-vision (BLV) developers. Our review of existing literature indicates that while LLMs help mitigate some of the challenges faced by BLV programmers, they also introduce new forms of inaccessibility. We conducted an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance across a comprehensive set of programming tasks. Our findings highlight several unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and notable limitations in interaction support for specific tasks. Through observing BLV developers as they engaged in coding activities, we uncovered key interaction barriers that go beyond model accuracy or code generation quality. This paper outlines the challenges and corresponding opportunities for improving accessibility in the context of generative AI-assisted programming. Addressing these issues can meaningfully enhance the programming experience for BLV developers. As the generative AI revolution continues to unfold, it must also address the unique burdens faced by this community.</description>

      <title>What Makes for a Good Saliency Map? Comparing Strategies for Evaluating Saliency Maps in Explainable AI (XAI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saliency maps are a popular approach for explaining classifications of (convolutional) neural networks. However, it remains an open question as to how best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1) for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e., there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.</description>

      <title>Psychological Effect of AI driven marketing tools for beauty/facial feature enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9 years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p&lt;0.001), with females more prone to digital enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these, in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.</description>

      <title>DashGuide: Authoring Interactive Dashboard Tours for Guiding Dashboard Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dashboard guidance helps dashboard users better navigate interactive features, understand the underlying data, and assess insights they can potentially extract from dashboards. However, authoring dashboard guidance is a time consuming task, and embedding guidance into dashboards for effective delivery is difficult to realize. In this work, we contribute DashGuide, a framework and system to support the creation of interactive dashboard guidance with minimal authoring input. Given a dashboard and a communication goal, DashGuide captures a sequence of author-performed interactions to generate guidance materials delivered as playable step-by-step overlays, a.k.a., dashboard tours. Authors can further edit and refine individual tour steps while receiving generative assistance. We also contribute findings from a formative assessment with 9 dashboard creators, which helped inform the design of DashGuide; and findings from an evaluation of DashGuide with 12 dashboard creators, suggesting it provides an improved authoring experience that balances efficiency, expressiveness, and creative freedom.</description>

      <title>Improving Human-Autonomous Vehicle Interaction in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success. Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive, modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent, adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals, and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers, researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

      <title>Augmenting Captions with Emotional Cues: An AR Interface for Real-Time Accessible Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an augmented reality (AR) captioning framework designed to support Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) learners in STEM classrooms by integrating non-verbal emotional cues into live transcriptions. Unlike conventional captioning systems that offer only plain text, our system fuses real-time speech recognition with affective and visual signal interpretation, including facial movements, gestures, and vocal tone, to produce emotionally enriched captions. These enhanced captions are rendered in an AR interface developed with Unity and provide contextual annotations such as speaker tone markers (e.g., "concerned") and gesture indicators (e.g., "nods"). The system leverages live camera and microphone input, processed through AI models to detect multimodal cues. Findings from preliminary evaluations suggest that this AR-based captioning approach significantly enhances comprehension and reduces cognitive effort compared to standard captions. Our work emphasizes the potential of immersive environments for inclusive, emotion-aware educational accessibility.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Deploying Learning-based CSI Localization on a Large-Scale ISAC Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points (APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing baseline.</description>

      <title>Factually: Exploring Wearable Fact-Checking for Augmented Truth Discernment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable devices are transforming human capabilities by seamlessly augmenting cognitive functions. In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</description>

      <title>MV-Crafter: An Intelligent System for Music-guided Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music videos, as a prevalent form of multimedia entertainment, deliver engaging audio-visual experiences to audiences and have gained immense popularity among singers and fans. Creators can express their interpretations of music naturally through visual elements. However, the creation process of music video demands proficiency in script design, video shooting, and music-video synchronization, posing significant challenges for non-professionals. Previous work has designed automated music video generation frameworks. However, they suffer from complexity in input and poor output quality. In response, we present MV-Crafter, a system capable of producing high-quality music videos with synchronized music-video rhythm and style. Our approach involves three technical modules that simulate the human creation process: the script generation module, video generation module, and music-video synchronization module. MV-Crafter leverages a large language model to generate scripts considering the musical semantics. To address the challenge of synchronizing short video clips with music of varying lengths, we propose a dynamic beat matching algorithm and visual envelope-induced warping method to ensure precise, monotonic music-video synchronization. Besides, we design a user-friendly interface to simplify the creation process with intuitive editing features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MV-Crafter provides an effective solution for improving the quality of generated music videos.</description>

      <title>Exploring Context-aware and LLM-driven Locomotion for Immersive Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locomotion plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience within virtual reality environments. In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering, and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence, cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in supporting accessibility.</description>

      <title>DataScout: Automatic Data Fact Retrieval for Statement Augmentation with an LLM-Based Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data story typically integrates data facts from multiple perspectives and stances to construct a comprehensive and objective narrative. However, retrieving these facts demands time for data search and challenges the creator's analytical skills. In this work, we introduce DataScout, an interactive system that automatically performs reasoning and stance-based data facts retrieval to augment the user's statement. Particularly, DataScout leverages an LLM-based agent to construct a retrieval tree, enabling collaborative control of its expansion between users and the agent. The interface visualizes the retrieval tree as a mind map that eases users to intuitively steer the retrieval direction and effectively engage in reasoning and analysis. We evaluate the proposed system through case studies and in-depth expert interviews. Our evaluation demonstrates that DataScout can effectively retrieve multifaceted data facts from different stances, helping users verify their statements and enhance the credibility of their stories.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian Means Field Classifier for EEG-Based BCI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of the Riemannian minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier for all kinds of EEG-based brain--computer interfaces (BCIs). This classifier is simple, fully deterministic, robust to noise, computationally efficient, and prone to transfer learning. Its training is very simple, requiring just the computation of a geometric mean of a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix per class. We propose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD matrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior. In order to promote reproducible research, our code will be released as open source.</description>

      <title>The Malicious Technical Ecosystem: Exposing Limitations in Technical Governance of AI-Generated Non-Consensual Intimate Images of Adults</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a survivor-centered approach to locate and dissect the role of sociotechnical AI governance in preventing AI-Generated Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII) of adults, colloquially known as "deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or "MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200 "nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining these gaps.</description>

      <title>INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students' questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and inclusive learning experience.</description>

      <title>'The Boring and the Tedious': Invisible Labour in India's Gig-Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India's gig-based food delivery platforms, such as Swiggy and Zomato, provide crucial income to marginalised communities but also entrench workers in cycles of invisible labour. Through 14 semi-structured interviews, we analyse waiting time and repetitive UI itneractions as key burdens that contribute to 'digital discomfort' for gig based food delivery agents. We find that workers employ creative strategies to navigate algorithmic management, yet remain constrained by platform-side 'gamification' and system opacity. We propose worker-centered GUI automation as a potential intervention to reduce friction while preserving agency. In conclusion, this position paper argues for rethinking HCI approaches in the Global South to prioritise worker autonomy over efficiency-driven design optimisations.</description>

      <title>LUIDA: Large-scale Unified Infrastructure for Digital Assessments based on Commercial Metaverse Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online experiments using metaverse platforms have gained significant traction in Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality (VR) research. However, current research workflows are highly fragmented, as researchers must use separate tools for system implementation, participant recruitment, experiment execution, and data collection, reducing consistency and increasing workload. We present LUIDA (Large-scale Unified Infrastructure for Digital Assessments), a metaverse-based framework that integrates these fragmented processes. LUIDA automatically allocates interconnected virtual environments for parallel experiment execution and provides implementation templates adaptable to various VR research domains, requiring minimal metaverse development expertise. Our evaluation included two studies using a prototype built on Cluster, the commercial metaverse platform. First, VR researchers using LUIDA to develop and run experiments reported high usability scores (SUS: 73.75) and moderate workload (NASA-TLX: 24.11) for overall usage, with interviews confirming streamlined workflows compared to traditional laboratory experiments. Second, we conducted three replicated experiments with public Cluster users, each recruiting approximately 200 participants within one week. These experiments produced results that closely matched the original studies, validating the experimental integrity of LUIDA across research domains. After technical refinements, we plan to release LUIDA as an open platform, providing a standardized protocol to improve research efficiency and experimental reproducibility in VR studies.</description>

      <title>Cybernetic Governance in a Coliving House</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an 18-month field experiment in distributed digital institutions: a nine-bedroom Los Angeles coliving house that runs without managers, while sustaining 98% occupancy and below-market rents.
  Drawing on Elinor Ostrom's commons theory, we outline design principles and three digital mechanisms that form the institutional core: 1) A continuous-auction chore scheduler turns regenerative labor into a time-indexed points market; residents meet a 100-point monthly obligation by claiming tasks whose value rises linearly with neglect. 2) A pairwise-preference layer lets participants asynchronously reprioritize tasks, translating meta-governance into low-cognition spot inputs. 3) A symbolic "hearts" ledger tracks norm compliance through automated enforcement, lightweight challenges, and peer-awarded karma. Together, these mechanisms operationalize cybernetic principles--human sensing, machine bookkeeping, real-time feedback--while minimizing dependence on privileged roles.
  Our exploratory data (567 chore claims, 255 heart events, and 551 group purchases) show that such tooling can sustain reliable commons governance without continuous leadership, offering a transferable design palette for online communities, coliving houses, and other digitally mediated collectives.</description>

      <title>AI for Accessible Education: Personalized Audio-Based Learning for Blind Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind and visually impaired (BVI) students face significant challenges in traditional educational settings. While screen readers and braille materials offer some accessibility, they often lack interactivity and real-time adaptability to individual learning needs. This paper presents Audemy, an AI-powered audio-based learning platform designed to provide personalized, accessible, and engaging educational experiences for BVI students. Audemy uses adaptive learning techniques to customize content based on student accuracy, pacing preferences, and engagement patterns. The platform has been iteratively developed with input from over 20 educators specializing in accessibility and currently serves over 2,000 BVI students. Educator insights show key considerations for accessible AI, including the importance of engagement, intuitive design, compatibility with existing assistive technologies, and the role of positive reinforcement in maintaining student motivation. Beyond accessibility, this paper explores the ethical implications of AI in education, emphasizing data privacy, security, and transparency. Audemy demonstrates how AI can empower BVI students with personalized and equitable learning opportunities, advancing the broader goal of inclusive education.</description>

      <title>Crisp: Cognitive Restructuring of Negative Thoughts through Multi-turn Supportive Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn dialogues. Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap, we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and 14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.</description>

      <title>Towards User-Centred Design of AI-Assisted Decision-Making in Law Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.</description>

      <title>WiReSens Toolkit: An Open-source Platform towards Accessible Wireless Tactile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past research has widely explored the design and fabrication of resistive matrix-based tactile sensors as a means of creating touch-sensitive devices. However, developing portable, adaptive, and long-lasting tactile sensing systems that incorporate these sensors remains challenging for individuals having limited prior experience with them. To address this, we developed the WiReSens Toolkit, an open-source platform for accessible wireless tactile sensing. Central to our approach is adaptive hardware for interfacing with resistive sensors and a web-based GUI that mediates access to complex functionalities for developing scalable tactile sensing systems, including 1) multi-device programming and wireless visualization across three distinct communication protocols 2) autocalibration methods for adaptive sensitivity and 3) intermittent data transmission for low-power operation. We validated the toolkit's usability through a user study with 11 novice participants, who, on average, successfully configured a tactile sensor with over 95\% accuracy in under five minutes, calibrated sensors 10x faster than baseline methods, and demonstrated enhanced tactile data sense-making.</description>

      <title>Should Benevolent Deception be Allowed in EHMI? A Mechanism Explanation Based on Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of external human-machine interface (EHMI) on autonomous vehicles (AVs) facilitates information exchange. Existing research fails to consider the impact of the sequence of actions, as well as the effects of EHMI applications and deception, raising the question of whether benevolent, well-intentioned deception should be permitted (i.e., misleading statements that are intended to benefit both parties). We established a game theory based EHMI information disclosure framework for AVs in this study. In considering benevolent deception, this framework divided the decision-making process into three stages, respectively encompassing three key questions: whether to disclose, when to disclose, and what type of intention information to disclose. The results show that theoretical advantages of deception exist in certain cases when AV expects to maximize the safety of the interaction. In 40 out of 484 cases (8.3%), safety can be enhanced through successful deception. Those successful deceptions fall into two categories: 1) In 28 of these cases, the straight-going AV expected the left-turning HV to yield, while HV exhibited lower speed and higher acceleration; 2) In 12 of these cases, AV expected HV to proceed first, while HV exhibited higher speed and lower acceleration. We also conducted a VR-based driving simulation experiment, and the results confirmed our conclusion. Additionally, we found that when participants had low trust in the EHMI, its use negatively impacted interaction efficiency instead. This study aims to analyze the mechanisms of EHMI information disclosure and contribute to the ongoing discourse on the ethical framework governing autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Subthreshold Jitter in VR Can Induce Visual Discomfort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-vestibular conflicts (VVCs) are a primary contributor to visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) in head-mounted displays (HMDs). However, virtual reality (VR) comfort studies often rely on exposing seated or standing users to experiences with high intensity visual motion (such as roller coasters). These drastic VVCs tend to induce pronounced VIMS symptoms that can be reliably detected across individuals using common survey measures. The conclusions from studies using these extreme motion-based conflicts may not accurately generalize to naturalistic use cases in VR where efforts are made to minimize, rather than maximize, VIMS symptoms. In this work, we show that a subthreshold visual-vestibular conflict can induce measurable discomfort during naturalistic, long duration use. We first present a psychophysical study, conducted outside of an HMD, to rigorously identify the perceptual thresholds for sinusoidal noise in render pose (i.e., jitter) resulting in erroneous 3D motion of rendered content. We next introduce subthreshold levels of jitter to a Meta Quest 3 VR HMD and demonstrate that this can induce visual discomfort in participants playing the commercially-available game Cubism across a three-session, repeated-measures study. Importantly, we did not identify statistically significant comfort differences between control and jitter conditions with traditional pre- and post-test comparison of Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores. Significant differences were only identified using the Motion Illness Symptoms Classification (MISC) survey administered every 10 minutes across each 90 minute session. This highlights the benefits of incorporating time-resolved data points and suggests that lightweight, more frequent surveys may be important tools for measuring visual discomfort in more ecologically-valid scenarios.</description>

      <title>Shifts in Doctors' Eye Movements Between Real and AI-Generated Medical Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eye-tracking analysis plays a vital role in medical imaging, providing key insights into how radiologists visually interpret and diagnose clinical cases. In this work, we first analyze radiologists' attention and agreement by measuring the distribution of various eye-movement patterns, including saccades direction, amplitude, and their joint distribution. These metrics help uncover patterns in attention allocation and diagnostic strategies. Furthermore, we investigate whether and how doctors' gaze behavior shifts when viewing authentic (Real) versus deep-learning-generated (Fake) images. To achieve this, we examine fixation bias maps, focusing on first, last, short, and longest fixations independently, along with detailed saccades patterns, to quantify differences in gaze distribution and visual saliency between authentic and synthetic images.</description>
