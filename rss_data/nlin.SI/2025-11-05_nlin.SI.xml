      <title>Banach Poisson-Lie groups, Lax equations and the AKS theorem in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the theory of $R$-brackets, Baxter brackets and Nijenhuis brackets in the Banach setting, in particular in relation with Banach Poisson-Lie groups. The notion of Banach Lie--Poisson space with respect to an arbitrary duality pairing is crucial for the equations of motion to make sense. In the presence of a non-degenerate invariant pairing on a Banach Lie algebra, these equations of motion assume a Lax form. We prove a version of the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem adapted to $R$-matrices on infinite-dimensional Banach algebras. Applications to the resolution of Lax equations associated to some Banach Manin triples are given. The semi-infinite Toda lattice is also presented as an example of this approach.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Approach to Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations with Retarded Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equations. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed. The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type theorems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally, several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>
