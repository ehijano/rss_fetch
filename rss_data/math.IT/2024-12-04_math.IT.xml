      <title>Event-Based Framework for Agile Resilience in Criticality-Aware Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As mission- and safety-critical wireless applications grow in complexity and diversity, next-generation wireless systems must meet increasingly stringent and multifaceted requirements. These systems demand resilience along with enhanced intelligence and adaptability to ensure reliable communication under diverse conditions. This paper proposes an event-based multi-stage resilience framework, offering a guideline for efficiently integrating a combination of error mitigation techniques. The framework is applied to a case study focusing on uplink transmission of mixed-criticality data in the presence of random link blockages. The proposed scheme combines multiple blockage mitigation strategies - rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), one-sided access point cooperation, and central decoding - within an event-driven algorithm. Each method, increasing in effectiveness and complexity, is activated sequentially to systematically overcome blockages. We model a mixed-criticality queuing system and formulate two transmit power allocation problems, one for separate decoding and one for central decoding, to ensure queue stability and fairness. Simulations evaluate the delay performance under varying blockage durations and examine the cost tradeoffs among resilience mechanisms within the proposed framework. The results suggest that passive robustness strategies effectively handle frequent short-term fluctuations, while more complex adaptation becomes germane for rare and prolonged blockages. Additionally, the results emphasize the importance of criticality-awareness for resilient communication design.</description>

      <title>Flexible-Antenna Systems: A Pinching-Antenna Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible-antenna systems have recently received significant research interest due to their capability to reconfigure wireless channels intelligently. This paper focuses on a new type of flexible-antenna technology, termed pinching antennas, which can be realized by applying small dielectric particles on a waveguide. Analytical results are first developed for the simple case with a single pinching antenna and a single waveguide, where the unique feature of the pinching-antenna system to create strong line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss is demonstrated. An advantageous feature of pinching-antenna systems is that multiple pinching antennas can be activated on a single waveguide at no extra cost; however, they must be fed with the same signal. This feature motivates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and analytical results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of NOMA-assisted pinching-antenna systems. Finally, the case with multiple pinching antennas and multiple waveguides is studied, which resembles a classical multiple-input single-input (MISO) interference channel. By exploiting the capability of pinching antennas to reconfigure the wireless channel, it is revealed that a performance upper bound on the interference channel becomes achievable, where the achievability conditions are also identified. Computer simulation results are presented to verify the developed analytical results and demonstrate the superior performance of pinching-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>What should a neuron aim for? Designing local objective functions based on information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.</description>

      <title>On the lifting degree of girth-8 QC-LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifting degree and the deterministic construction of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes have been extensively studied, with many construction methods in the literature, including those based on finite geometry, array-based codes, computer search, and combinatorial techniques. In this paper, we focus on the lifting degree $p$ required for achieving a girth of 8 in $(3,L)$ fully connected QC-LDPC codes, and we propose an improvement over the classical lower bound $p\geq 2L-1$, enhancing it to $p\geq \sqrt{5L^2-11L+\frac{13}{2}}+\frac{1}{2}$. Moreover, we demonstrate that for girth-8 QC-LDPC codes containing an arithmetic row in the exponent matrix, a necessary condition for achieving a girth of 8 is $p\geq \frac{1}{2}L^2+\frac{1}{2}L$. Additionally, we present a corresponding deterministic construction of $(3,L)$ QC-LDPC codes with girth 8 for any $p\geq \frac{1}{2}L^2+\frac{1}{2}L+\lfloor \frac{L-1}{2}\rfloor$, which approaches the lower bound of $\frac{1}{2}L^2+\frac{1}{2}L$. Under the same conditions, this construction achieves a smaller lifting degree compared to prior methods. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed order of lifting degree matches the smallest known, on the order of $\frac{1}{2}L^2+\mathcal{O} (L)$.</description>

      <title>Mobile Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Scalable Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) offers significant advantages in mobility scenarios, mainly due to the elimination of cell boundaries and strong macro diversity. In this paper, we examine the downlink performance of cell-free mMIMO systems equipped with mobile-APs utilizing the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles, where mobility and power control are jointly considered to effectively enhance coverage and suppress interference. However, the high computational complexity, poor collaboration, limited scalability, and uneven reward distribution of conventional optimization schemes lead to serious performance degradation and instability. These factors complicate the provision of consistent and high-quality service across all user equipments in downlink cell-free mMIMO systems. Consequently, we propose a novel scalable framework enhanced by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle these challenges. The established framework incorporates a graph neural network (GNN)-aided communication mechanism to facilitate effective collaboration among agents, a permutation architecture to improve scalability, and a directional decoupling architecture to accurately distinguish contributions. In the numerical results, we present comparisons of different optimization schemes and network architectures, which reveal that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance system performance compared to conventional schemes due to the adoption of advanced technologies. In particular, appropriately compressing the observation space of agents is beneficial for achieving a better balance between performance and convergence.</description>

      <title>Quaternary and Component-Binary Spreading Codes with Low Correlation for Navigation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this two-part paper, we construct a family MFD$_2$ of low-correlation quaternary spreading codes having period $2046$. By quaternary, we mean that the spreading code symbols are drawn from $Z_4$ and are designed to be used in conjunction with QPSK modulation. Apart from low auto and crosscorrelation properties, we also require in addition, to our knowledge for the first time, that the spreading code family IZ4$_2$ obtained by taking the union of the component in-phase and quadrature-phase binary spreading codes associated to each quaternary spreading code in MFD$_2$, also have desirable low-correlation properties. We also investigate the balance of the quaternary and binary spreading codes.
  The second part is motivated by an application to the design of spreading code, (in this application termed as ranging codes), having parameters suitable for use in a lunar PNT system. Two lengths that are of particular current interest for a planned lunar PNT satellite system are $2046$ and $10230$. We study the applicability of a subset IZ4$_{2S}$ of IZ4$_2$ containing balanced binary spreading codes having length $2046$ to such a lunar PNT system. We show that the spreading codes belonging to IZ4$_{2S}$ compare favorably with the spreading codes of length $2046$ appearing in a recent issue of Inside GNSS. We also show that the IZ4$_{10}$ spreading code family in which the spreading codes have length $10230$, compares well in comparison with spreading codes of length $10230$ described in this article. In addition, the IZ4$_{10}$ and IZ4$_2$ spreading codes have been paired so as to be orthogonal at zero shift despite their different lengths and chipping rates.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Auto-Encoder for Short Linear Block Codes: A DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel auto-encoder based end-to-end channel encoding and decoding. It integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and graph neural networks (GNN) in code design by modeling the generation of code parity-check matrices as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), to optimize key coding performance metrics such as error-rates and code algebraic properties. An edge-weighted GNN (EW-GNN) decoder is proposed, which operates on the Tanner graph with an iterative message-passing structure. Once trained on a single linear block code, the EW-GNN decoder can be directly used to decode other linear block codes of different code lengths and code rates. An iterative joint training of the DRL-based code designer and the EW-GNN decoder is performed to optimize the end-end encoding and decoding process. Simulation results show the proposed auto-encoder significantly surpasses several traditional coding schemes at short block lengths, including low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the belief propagation (BP) decoding and the maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), and BCH with BP decoding, offering superior error-correction capabilities while maintaining low decoding complexity.</description>

      <title>BiCSI: A Binary Encoding and Fingerprint-Based Matching Algorithm for Wi-Fi Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional global positioning systems often underperform indoors, whereas Wi-Fi has become an effective medium for various radio sensing services. Specifically, utilizing channel state information (CSI) from Wi-Fi networks provides a non-contact method for precise indoor positioning; yet, accurately interpreting the complex CSI matrix to develop a reliable strategy for physical similarity measurement remains challenging. This paper presents BiCSI, which merges binary encoding with fingerprint-based techniques to improve position matching for detecting semi-stationary targets. Inspired by gene sequencing processes, BiCSI initially converts CSI matrices into binary sequences and employs Hamming distances to evaluate signal similarity. The results show that BiCSI achieves an average accuracy above 98% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than three centimeters, outperforming algorithms directly dependent on physical measurements by at least two-fold. Moreover, the proposed method for extracting feature vectors from CSI matrices as fingerprints significantly reduces data storage requirements to the kilobyte range, far below the megabytes typically required by conventional machine learning models. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm adapts well to multiple physical similarity metrics, and remains robust over different time periods, enhancing its utility and versatility in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring Evolutionary Spectral Clustering for Temporal-Smoothed Clustered Cell-Free Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustered cell-free networking, which dynamically partitions the whole network into nonoverlapping subnetworks, has been recently proposed to mitigate the cell-edge problem in cellular networks. However, prior works only focused on optimizing clustered cell-free networking in static scenarios with fixed users. This could lead to a large number of handovers in the practical dynamic environment with moving users, seriously hindering the implementation of clustered cell-free networking in practice. This paper considers user mobility and aims to simultaneously maximize the sum rate and minimize the number of handovers. By transforming the multi-objective optimization problem into a time-varying graph partitioning problem and exploring evolutionary spectral clustering, a temporal-smoothed clustered cell-free networking algorithm is proposed, which is shown to be effective in smoothing network partitions over time and reducing handovers while maintaining similar sum rate.</description>

      <title>Communicate or Sense? AP Mode Selection in mmWave Cell-Free Massive MIMO-ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technology for future mobile networks, enabling sensing applications to be performed by existing communication networks, consequently improving the system efficiency. Millimeter wave (mmWave) signals provide high sensing resolution and high data rate but suffer from sensitivity to blockage. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), with a large number of distributed access points (APs), can overcome this challenge by providing macro diversity against changing blockages and can save energy consumption by deactivating unfavorable APs. Thus, in this work, we propose a joint dynamic AP mode selection and power allocation scheme for mmWave cell-free massive MIMO-ISAC, where APs are assigned either as ISAC transmitters, sensing receivers, or shut down. Due to the large size of the original problem, we propose three different sub-optimal algorithms that minimize the number of active APs while guaranteeing the sensing and communication constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that assigning ISAC transmitters only satisfying communication constraints, followed up by sensing receiver assignment only for sensing constraint achieves the best performance-complexity balance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen a number of advances in computationally efficient algorithms for statistical methods subject to robustness constraints. An estimator may be robust in a number of different ways: to contamination of the dataset, to heavy-tailed data, or in the sense that it preserves privacy of the dataset. We survey recent results in these areas with a focus on the problem of mean estimation, drawing technical and conceptual connections between the various forms of robustness, showing that the same underlying algorithmic ideas lead to computationally efficient estimators in all these settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) technology is expected to provide precise and reliable positioning capabilities along with high data rates. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started introducing positioning techniques from Release-16 based on time, angle, and signal strength using reference signals. However, validating these techniques with experimental prototypes is crucial before successful real-world deployment. This work provides useful tools and implementation details that are required in performing 5G positioning experiments with OpenAirInterface (OAI). As an example use case, we present an round trip time (RTT) estimation test-bed based on OAI and discusses the real-word experiment and measurement process.</description>

      <title>Double-Directional V2V Channel Measurement using ReRoMA at 60 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coordination of vehicles is a crucial element of autonomous driving, as it enhances the efficiency, convenience, and safety of road traffic. In order to fully exploit the capabilities of such coordination, communication with high data rate and low latency is required. It can be reasonably argued that millimeter-wave (mm-wave) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) systems are capable of fulfilling the aforementioned requirements. Nevertheless, in order to develop a system that can be deployed in real-world scenarios and to gain an understanding of the various effects of mm-wave propagation, it is necessary to perform radio propagation measurements and to derive radio channel models from them across a range of scenarios and environments. To this end, we have conducted measurement campaigns at 60\,GHz in a variety of situations, including driving in a convoy, driving in opposite direction on a six-lane road, and overtaking. These measurements employ a channel sounder based on ReRoMA, a recently introduced concept that enables the real-time measurement of dynamic double-directional radio channels. The evaluations presented herein encompass key channel parameters, including the path loss (path loss coefficient of approximately 1.9), the root mean square (RMS) delay spread (within a range of 5\,ns to 110\,ns), the angular spreads (in a range of 0.05 to 0.4), the power distribution among multipath components, and the channel stationarity time (multiple seconds).</description>

Abstract: At present, in lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes, especially under the standard model, there are very few schemes with tight security. This paper constructs the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature scheme that achieves tight security against existential unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the standard model. Furthermore, among existing schemes, the scheme proposed in this paper also offers certain advantages in terms of public key size, signature length, and computational cost.</description>
