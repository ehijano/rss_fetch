      <title>Signatures of quantum chaos and complexity in the Ising model on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of quantum chaos and complexity in the quantum annealing Ising model on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. By tuning the connectivity of the graph, the dynamics can be driven from a localized phase through a chaotic regime to an integrable limit. While this dynamical transition reflects in the spectral characteristics, we pursue a broader suite of quantum chaos indicators,some of which can be measured on near-term quantum devices. We study deep thermalization of a quantum state ensemble obtained from a natural unraveling of the subsystem density matrix as an indicator of chaotic dynamics. This extends the analysis of quantum chaos to the ensemble of quantum states. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenstate and eigenvalue correlations through the partial spectral form factor of subsystems and observe distinct signatures of the onset of chaos and its system size dependence, providing experimentally measurable indicators of the localization-to-chaos transition. As a locality-independent probe, we show that the Krylov complexity of operators is also maximized in the chaotic regime, providing a link between graph topology and information scrambling. Finally, we investigate a quantum analogue of the Mpemba effect, where initially "hotter" states can thermalize anomalously fast, a phenomenon most cleanly observed within the chaotic phase. However, away from the chaotic regime, the system is distinguished by multiple crossings across connectivity in its distance from the thermal ensemble with time. Collectively, this work presents a broad characterization of chaos, providing insight beyond spectral analysis and practical indicators for benchmarking near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Topological band insulators without translational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the research of the topological band phases, the conventional wisdom is to start from the crystalline translational symmetry systems. Nevertheless, the translational symmetry is not always a necessary condition for the energy bands. Here we propose a systematic method of constructing the topological band insulators without translational symmetry in the amorphous systems. By way of the isospectral reduction approach from spectral graph theory, we reduce the structural-disordered systems formed by different multi-atomic cells into the isospectral effective periodic systems with the energy-dependent hoppings and potentials. We identify the topological band insulating phases with extended bulk states and topological in-gap edge states by the topological invariants of the reduced systems, density of states, and the commutation of the transfer matrix. In addition, when the building blocks of the two multi-atomic cells have different number of the lattice sites, our numerical calculations demonstrate that the existences of the flat band and the macroscopic bound states in the continuum in the amorphous systems. Our findings uncover a new arena for the exploration of the topological band states beyond translational symmetry systems paradigm.</description>

      <title>Oxide Interface-Based Polymorphic Electronic Devices for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03515v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aside from recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, specialized AI hardware is crucial to address large volumes of unstructured and dynamic data. Hardware-based AI, built on conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-technology, faces several critical challenges including scaling limitation of devices [1, 2], separation of computation and memory units [3] and most importantly, overall system energy efficiency [4]. While numerous materials with emergent functionalities have been proposed to overcome these limitations, scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility remain critical obstacles [5, 6]. Here, we demonstrate oxide-interface based polymorphic electronic devices with programmable transistor, memristor, and memcapacitor functionalities by manipulating the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures [7, 8] using lateral gates. A circuit utilizing two polymorphic functionalities of transistor and memcapacitor exhibits nonlinearity and short-term memory, enabling implementation in physical reservoir computing. An integrated circuit incorporating transistor and memristor functionalities is utilized for the transition from short- to long-term synaptic plasticity and for logic operations, along with in-situ logic output storage. The same circuit with advanced reconfigurable synaptic logic operations presents high-level multi-input decision-making tasks, such as patient-monitoring in healthcare applications. Our findings pave the way for oxide-based monolithic integrated circuits in a scalable, silicon compatible, energy efficient single platform, advancing both the polymorphic and neuromorphic computings.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Inorganic Materials Discovery via Multi-Agent Physics-Aware Scientific Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Reflectionless Mode Exceptional Degeneracies via Emergent Local Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new kind of physically realizable exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) corresponding to synthetic reflectionless modes (SRM). These are solutions of an auxiliary wave operator that is defined in synthetic frequency dimensions and describe incoming reflectionless waves onto a Floquet-driven cavity. The SRM-EPD emerges as a consequence of a spontaneous local PT-symmetry imposed on the auxiliary operator via appropriate Floquet driving. Its presence signifies the possibility to design wavefronts and time-modulated schemes with up/down targeted frequency conversion and flat transmission spectra. The theory is validated via simulations with driven RF resonators.</description>

      <title>Class Imbalance in Anomaly Detection: Learning from an Exactly Solvable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance (CI) is a longstanding problem in machine learning, slowing down training and reducing performances. Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and offer practical guidelines to address it.</description>

      <title>Magic dynamics in many-body localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic, quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of quantum magic in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence magic spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Architecture Search for Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecture design and optimization are challenging problems in the field of artificial neural networks. Working in this context, we here present SPARCS (SPectral ARchiteCture Search), a novel architecture search protocol which exploits the spectral attributes of the inter-layer transfer matrices. SPARCS allows one to explore the space of possible architectures by spanning continuous and differentiable manifolds, thus enabling for gradient-based optimization algorithms to be eventually employed. With reference to simple benchmark models, we show that the newly proposed method yields a self-emerging architecture with a minimal degree of expressivity to handle the task under investigation and with a reduced parameter count as compared to other viable alternatives.</description>

      <title>Atomic scale structure and dynamical properties of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses through first-principles modeling and XRD measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resort to first-principles molecular dynamics, in synergy with experiments, to study structural evolution and Na$^+$ cation diffusion inside (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ (x = 0.10-0.40) glasses. Experimental and modeling results show a fair quantitative agreement in terms of total X-ray structure factors and pair distribution functions, thereby setting the ground for a comprehensive analysis of the glassy matrix evolution. We find that the structure of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses deviates drastically from that of pure TeO$_2$ glass. Specifically, increasing the Na$_2$O concentration leads to a reduction of the coordination number of Te atoms, reflecting the occurrence of a structural depolymerization upon introduction of the Na$_2$O modifier oxide. The depolymerization phenomenon is ascribed to the transformation of Te-O-Te bridges into terminal Te-O non bridging oxygen atoms (NBO). Consequently, the concentration of NBO increases in these systems as the concentration of the modifier increases, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the coordination number of Na atoms. The structure factors results show a prominent peak at 1.4 A, that becomes more and more pronounced as the Na2O concentration increases. The occurrence of this first sharp diffraction peak is attributed to the growth of Na-rich channels inside the amorphous network, acting as preferential routes for alkali-ion conduction inside the relatively stable Te-O matrix. These channels enhance the ion mobility.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>
