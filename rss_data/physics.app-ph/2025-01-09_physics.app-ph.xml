      <title>Probabilistic Greedy Algorithm Solver Using Magnetic Tunneling Junctions for Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are foundational challenges in fields such as artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design. Traditional algorithms, including greedy methods and dynamic programming, often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality, particularly as problem complexity scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and efficient probabilistic optimization framework that integrates true random number generators (TRNGs) based on spin-transfer torque magnetic tunneling junctions (STT-MTJs). The inherent stochastic switching behavior of STT-MTJs enables dynamic configurability of random number distributions, which we leverage to introduce controlled randomness into a probabilistic greedy algorithm. By tuning a temperature parameter, our algorithm seamlessly transitions between deterministic and stochastic strategies, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), showcasing its ability to consistently produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem scales. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both solution quality and convergence speed compared to classical approaches, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Specifically, in larger TSP instances involving up to 70 cities, it retains its performance advantage, achieving near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational costs. This work highlights the potential of integrating MTJ-based TRNGs into optimization algorithms, paving the way for future applications in probabilistic computing and hardware-accelerated optimization.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient: New Approach to Study Auxetic Piezoelectric Harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology to assess the performance of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters (PEHs) in order to study auxetic enhancement possibilities. For this purpose, a new approach for evaluating the intrinsic effective Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient (EMCC) of piezoelectric layers is presented. As the current assessment methods are questioned under resonance exposures, theoretical models are presented to suggest what characteristics the harvested power will depend on. A two axis graph is introduced to enable the comparison of different PEHs. The method is finally applied to PEHs with different types of substrates: filled, hollow and auxetic. First results show that, generally, auxetic structures might not increase the intrinsic EMCC but only improve the elastic energy ratio in the piezoelectric layers.</description>

      <title>Deterministic printing and heterointegration of single colloidal quantum dot photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.</description>

      <title>Novel magnetic-field-free switching behavior in vdW-magnet/oxide heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current-induced out-of-plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal systems, where the current-induced spin polarization aligns in-plane orthogonal to the in-plane charge current and out-of-plane spin current. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for magnetic-field-free switching by fabricating a van-der-Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic-field-free switching is possible because the current-driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out-of-plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in-plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. We successfully combined van-der-Waals magnet and oxide for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin-orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows us to establish a new way of magnetic field-free switching. Our work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van-der-Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct wavefunction-localization phenomena arising out of disorder and non-reciprocity, respectively. An integration of both in a single framework will provide a platform to study the interplay between the two. In this connection, we consider the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which has garnered significant attention among the disordered models due to its self-dual properties. Hence, we investigate a non-reciprocal AA model with complex phase modulation and implement it in suitably designed topolectrical circuits featuring an interface, segregating two non-equivalent circuit networks. In the circuit, the voltage profile localizes at the interface due to the NHSE, while the AL limits localization phenomena within the vicinity of the excitation node. This competing phenomenon leads to a controllable, node-dependent localization or even partial delocalization of the output voltage. Our results not only provide a practical platform for experimentally studying and controlling the wave localization phenomenon but also highlight the potential of circuit architectures in designing highly sensitive sensors and information transfer in communication devices.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Atomic-scale Semiconductor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin states in semiconductors provide exceptionally stable and noise-resistant environments for qubits, positioning them as optimal candidates for reliable quantum computing technologies. The proposal to use nuclear and electronic spins of donor atoms in silicon, introduced by Kane in 1998, sparked a new research field focused on the precise positioning of individual impurity atoms for quantum devices, utilising scanning tunnelling microscopy and ion implantation. This roadmap article reviews the advancements in the 25 years since Kane's proposal, the current challenges, and the future directions in atomic-scale semiconductor device fabrication and measurement. It covers the quest to create a silicon-based quantum computer and expands to include diverse material systems and fabrication techniques, highlighting the potential for a broad range of semiconductor quantum technological applications. Key developments include phosphorus in silicon devices such as single-atom transistors, arrayed few-donor devices, one- and two-qubit gates, three-dimensional architectures, and the development of a toolbox for future quantum integrated circuits. The roadmap also explores new impurity species like arsenic and antimony for enhanced scalability and higher-dimensional spin systems, new chemistry for dopant precursors and lithographic resists, and the potential for germanium-based devices. Emerging methods, such as photon-based lithography and electron beam manipulation, are discussed for their disruptive potential. This roadmap charts the path toward scalable quantum computing and advanced semiconductor quantum technologies, emphasising the critical intersections of experiment, technological development, and theory.</description>

      <title>Obstacles to two-line Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obstacles to the two-line Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) designs, aimed at increasing the allowed pump wave energy and, hence, the gain growth through the combination of linear and nonlinear lines as pump and signal lines is discussed. This analysis takes into account both the mutual coupling and the discreteness of the artificial waveguide lines. Significant restrictions arise from the cyclical transfer of the traveling wave's energy from one line to the other one with phase step by $\pi$ every beat cycle. Moreover, the other restrictions result from the phase mismatch between the pump, signal and idler waves due to both the coupling and the discreteness of the artificial lines.</description>
