      <title>Oriented diameter of the complete tripartite graph (III)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bridgeless graph $G$, let $\mathbb{D}(G)$ be the set of all strong orientations of $G$, and define the oriented diameter $f(G)$ of $G$ to be the minimum of diameters $diam(D)$ among all the strong orientations $D\in \mathbb{D}(G)$, i.e., $f(G)=\min\{diam(D)\mid D\in \mathbb{D}(G)\}$. In this paper, we determine the oriented diameter of complete tripartite graph $K(3,p,q)$ for $p\geqslant 5$. Combining with the previous results, the oriented diameter of complete tripartite graph $K(3,p,q)$ are known.</description>

      <title>Partial and Exact Recovery of a Random Hypergraph from its Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included iid so that the average degree is $n^\delta$. The projection of a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to some hyperedge. The goal is to reconstruct the hypergraph given its projection. An earlier work of Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024) showed that exact recovery for $d=3$ is possible if and only if $\delta &lt; 2/5$. This work completely resolves the question for all values of $d$ for both exact and partial recovery and for both cases of whether multiplicity information about each edge is available or not. In addition, we show that the reconstruction fidelity undergoes an all-or-nothing transition at a threshold. In particular, this resolves all conjectures from Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024).</description>

      <title>On the clique covering numbers of Johnson graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the vertex clique covering numbers of Johnson graphs $J(N, k)$, the smallest numbers of cliques necessary to cover the vertices of those graphs.
  We prove identities for the values of these numbers when $k \leq 3$, and $k \geq N - 3$, and using computational methods, we provide explicit values for a range of small graphs. By drawing on connections to coding theory and combinatorial design theory, we prove various bounds on the clique covering numbers for general Johnson graphs, and we show how constant-weight lexicodes can be utilized to create optimal covers of $J(2k, k)$ when $k$ is a small power of two.</description>

      <title>Littlewood--Richardson rules from quivers for two-step flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\bigwedge_1$ and $\bigwedge_2$ be two symmetric function algebras in independent sets of variables. We define vector space bases of $\bigwedge_1 \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \bigwedge_2$ coming from certain quivers, with vertex sets indexed by pairs of partitions. We use these vector space bases to give a positive tableau formula for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients for the product of Schubert polynomials with certain Schur polynomials in two-step flag varieties, in the spirit of the Remmel-Whitney rule for the product of two Schur polynomials in Grassmannians. This in particular covers the cases considered by the Pieri rule.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Macaulay Posets and Macaulay Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A poset is Macaulay if its partial order and an additional total order interact well. Analogously, a ring is Macaulay if the partial order defined on its monomials by division interacts nicely with any total monomial order. We investigate methods of obtaining new structures through combining Macaulay rings and posets by means of certain operations inspired by topology. We examine whether these new structures retain the Macaulay property, identifying new classes of posets and rings for which the operations preserve the Macaulay property.</description>

      <title>The dual Cheeger-Buser inequality for graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of bipartiteness ratio for graphons. We prove the dual Cheeger-Buser inequality for graphons, which relates the gap between $2$ and the top of the spectrum of the Laplacian of a graphon with its bipartiteness ratio. The dual Cheeger-Buser inequality was established by Trevisan and Bauer-Jost for graphs. Our result is an analog of that for graphons.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Tutte polynomial for graphs embedded in surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several different extensions of the Tutte polynomial to graphs embedded in surfaces. To help frame the different options, here we consider the problem of extending the Tutte polynomial to cellularly embedded graphs starting from first principles. We offer three different routes to defining such a polynomial and show that they all lead to the same polynomial. This resulting polynomial is known in the literature under a few different names including the ribbon graph polynomial, and 2-variable Bollobas-Riordan polynomial.
  Our overall aim here is to use this discussion as a mechanism for providing a gentle introduction to the topic of Tutte polynomials for graphs embedded in surfaces.</description>

      <title>On generic $\Delta$-modular integer matrices with two rows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The column number question asks for the maximal number of columns of an integer matrix with the property that all its rank size minors are bounded by a fixed parameter $\Delta$ in absolute value. Polynomial upper bounds have been proved in various settings in recent years, with consequences for algorithmic questions in integer linear programming. In this paper, we focus on the exact determination of the maximal column number of such matrices with two rows and no vanishing $2$-minors. We prove that for large enough $\Delta$, this number is a quasi-linear function, non-decreasing and always even. Such basic structural properties of column number functions are barely known, but expected to hold in other settings as well.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphs for disjoint union of vertex-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $F$, let ${\rm EX}(n,F)$ be the set of $F$-free graphs of order $n$ with the maximum number of edges. The graph $F$ is called vertex-critical, if the deletion of its some vertex induces a graph with smaller chromatic number. For example, an odd wheel (obtained by connecting a vertex to a cycle of even length) is a vertex-critical graph with chromatic number 3. For $h\geq2$, let $F_{1},F_{2},...,F_{h}$ be vertex-critical graphs with the same chromatic number. Let $\cup_{1\leq i\leq h}F_{i}$ be the disjoint union of them. In this paper, we characterize the graphs in ${\rm EX}(n,\cup_{1\leq i\leq h}F_{i})$, when there is a proper order among the graphs $F_{1},F_{2},...,F_{h}$. This solves a conjecture (on extremal problem for disjoint union of odd wheels) proposed by Xiao and Zamora \cite{XZ}.</description>

      <title>Self-affine quadrangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadrangle in the Euclidean plane is called $n$-self-affine if it has a dissection into $n$ affine images of itself. All convex quadrangles are known to be $n$-self-affine for every $n \ge 5$. The only $2$-self-affine convex quadrangles are trapezoids. Here we characterize all $3$-self-affine convex quadrangles, obtaining $5$ one-parameter families and $13$ singular examples of affine types. This way we reduce the quest for all $n$-self-affine convex quadrangles to the open case $n=4$.
  In addition, we show that there are $n$-self-affine non-convex quadrangles for all $n \ge 3$, but not for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Coarse cops and robber in graphs and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators.
  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\infty$.
  We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.</description>

      <title>Homochiral inflation for the aperiodic monotile Tile(1,1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered chiral monotile Tile(1,1) is tiling the plane in a quasiperiodic fashion by taking twelve different orientations when applying $2\pi/12$ rotation. An homochiral inflation construction of such a quasiperiodic tiling is proposed where the chirality of the monotile is completely fixed at all inflation steps, avoiding to exchange its chirality between two successive steps. Doing so, the twelve possible orientations of the monotile are explicitly coded and the key difference between odd and even orientations is taken into account. The tiling is decomposed using only two different clusters, $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$, each of them taking six possible orientations. This gives a total set of twelve metatiles, which assembly can be mapped onto a triangular lattice. This approach allows to properly separate rotation and translation symmetry elements relating monotiles together. As all possible orientations of the two clusters are already incorporated in the twelve metatiles, positions of adjacent metatiles are given by translations which are along three equivalent directions ($2\pi/3$ rotation) as evidenced by junction lines. Finally, thanks to the homochiral inflation, the orientation distribution of the monotile at each inflation step is computed.</description>

      <title>A Note on Weak Saturation Number of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we estimate the weak saturation numbers of trees. As a case study, we examine caterpillars and obtain several tight estimates. In particular, this implies that for any $\alpha\in [1,2]$, there exist caterpillars with $k$ vertices whose weak saturation numbers are of order $k^\alpha$. We call a tree good if its weak saturation number is exactly its edge number minus one. We provide a sufficient condition for a tree to be a good tree. With the additional property that all leaves are at even distances from each other, this condition fully characterizes good trees. The latter result also provides counterexamples, demonstrating that Theorem 8 of a paper by Faudree, Gould and Jacobson (R. J. Faudree, R. J. Gould, and M. S. Jacobson. Weak saturation numbers for sparse graphs. {\it Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory}, 33(4): 677-693, 2013.) is incorrect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two new families of permutation group polynomials over finite fields of arbitrary characteristic, which are special types of bivariate local permutation polynomials. For each family, we explicitly construct their companions. Furthermore, we precisely determine the total number of permutation group polynomials equivalent to the proposed families. Moreover, we resolve the problem of enumerating permutation group polynomials that are equivalent to $e$-Klenian polynomials over finite fields for $e\geq 1$, a problem previously noted as nontrivial by Gutierrez and Urroz (2023).</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles, the regions surrounded by them and labeled Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in arrangements of circles and the regions surrounded by them. {\it Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs} have been fundamental and strong tools in studying shapes of regions surrounded by real algebraic curves, since around 2020. They are natural graphs the regions naturally collapse to and were first formulated by Sorea with several researchers. Studying shapes of such regions is one of fundamental studies in real algebraic geometry and combinatorics for example. This is surprisingly new and recently developing.
  Our study introduces labels on vertices and edges of such graphs encoding information of the circles where we concentrate on regions surrounded by circles. The author studied local changes of Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs by addition of circles under certain rules before and we discuss changes of new types. The author has started related studies motivated by singularity theory of real algebraic maps and found first that our regions are the images of natural real algebraic maps, generalizing natural projections of spheres.</description>

      <title>From descriptive to distributed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past couple of years a rich connection has been found between the fields of descriptive set theory and distributed computing. Frequently, and less surprisingly, finitary algorithms can be adopted to the infinite setting, resulting in theorems about infinite, definable graphs. In this survey, we take a different perspective and illustrate how results and ideas from descriptive set theory provide new insights and techniques to the theory of distributed computing. We focus on the two classical topics from graph theory, vertex and edge colorings. After summarizing the up-to-date results from both areas, we discuss the adaptation of Marks' games method to the LOCAL model of distributed computing and the development of the multi-step Vizing's chain technique, which led to the construction of the first non-trivial distributed algorithms for Vizing colorings. We provide a list of related open problems to complement our discussion. Finally, we describe an efficient deterministic distributed algorithm for Brooks coloring on graphs of subexponential growth.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study different variants of the Cops-and-Robber game with respect to cop- and robber\-/monotonicity.
  We study a visible and invisible robber and variants where the robber is lazy, thus can only move when the cops announce to move on top of him.
  In all four combinations, we also vary the number $s$ of edges that the robber can traverse in a single round, called speed.
  We complete the study of the unbounded speed case by showing that, besides the active variants, also the visible lazy variant has both the cop- and robber\-/monotonicity property.
  Furthermore, we prove that the cop\-/monotone invisible lazy copwidth characterizes path-width, while the non\-/monotone and robber\-/monotone is known to characterize tree-width, thus these variants differ even in the unbounded speed case.
  We find that, even with speed restriction, the cop\-/monotone invisible copwidth and the robber\-/monotone invisible active copwidth all characterize path-width.
  On the other hand, we show that the path-width of a graph can be arbitrarily larger than the number of cops needed to win the non\-/monotone invisible active variant.
  To complete our study of cop\-/monotone variants, we show that also in the visible variants the cop\-/monotone copwidth can be arbitrarily larger than the non\-/monotone.
  Regarding robber\-/monotonicity, for all speeds $s\geq 4$, we give graphs where the non\-/monotone and robber\-/monotone copwidth differ.
  On the other hand, we prove that there is a function that bounds the robber\-/monotone copwidth in terms of the non\-/monotone copwidth and the speed, thus the gap between the variants is bounded.
  This proof also yields that a graph class has bounded expansion if and only if, for every speed $s$, the number of cops needed in any robber\-/monotone lazy variant is bounded by some constant $c(s)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transmission of a vertex in a connected graph is the sum of distances from that vertex to all the other vertices. A connected graph is transmission irregular if any two distinct vertices have different transmissions. We present an efficient algorithm that generates all the transmission irregular trees up to a given order, up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Skew odd orthogonal characters and interpolating Schur polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two vertex operators to realize skew odd orthogonal characters $so_{\lambda/\mu}(x^{\pm})$ and derive the Cauchy identity for the skew characters via Toeplitz-Hankel-type determinant similar to the Schur functions. The method also gives new proofs of the Jacobi--Trudi identity and Gelfand--Tsetlin patterns for $so_{\lambda/\mu}(x^{\pm})$. Moreover, combining the vertex operators related to characters of types $C,D$ (\cite{Ba1996,JN2015}) and the new vertex operators related to $B$-type characters, we obtain three families of symmetric polynomials that interpolate among characters of $SO_{2n+1}(\mathbb{C})$, $SO_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ and $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$, Their transition formulas are also explicitly given among symplectic and/or orthogonal characters and odd orthogonal characters.</description>

      <title>Directed branch-width: A directed analogue of tree-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gurski and Wanke showed that a graph class C has bounded tree-width if and only if its associated class of directed line graphs has bounded clique-width. Inevitably -- asking whether this relationship lifts to directed graphs -- we introduce a new digraph width measure: we obtain it by investigating digraphs whose directed line graphs have bounded cliquewidth. Thus, to generalize Gurski and Wanke's aforementioned result, we introduce a natural generalization of branch-width to digraphs and we name it accordingly.
  Directed branch-width is a genuinely directed width-measure insofar as it cannot be used to bound the value of the underlying undirected tree-width. Despite this, the two measures are still closely related: the directed branch-width of a digraph D can differ from the branch-width of its underlying undirected graph only at sources and sinks. This relationship allows us to extend a range of algorithmic results from directed graphs with bounded underlying treewidth to the strictly larger class of digraphs having bounded directed branch-width.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the extremal trees that maximize the number of almost-perfect matchings, which are matchings covering all but one or two vertices, and those that maximize the number of strong almost-perfect matchings, which are matchings missing only one or two leaves. We also determine the trees that minimize the number of maximal matchings. We apply these results to extremal problems on the weighted Hosoya index for several choices of vertex-degree-based weight function.</description>

      <title>Euclidean sets with only one distance modulo a prime ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. If the squared distance between any two distinct points in $X$ is an odd integer, then the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $d+2$, as shown by Rosenfeld (1997) or Smith (1995). They proved that there exists a $(d+2)$-point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ having only odd integral squared distances if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$. The distances can be interpreted as an element of the finite field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We generalize this result for a local ring $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ as follows. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field that can be embedded into $\mathbb{R}$. Fix an embedding of $K$ into $\mathbb{R}$, and $K$ is interpreted as a subfield of $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A=O_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$, and $\mathfrak{p}$ a prime ideal of $O_K$. Let $(A_\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p})$ be the local ring obtained from the localization $(A\setminus \mathfrak{p})^{-1} A$, which is interpreted as a subring of $\mathbb{R}$. If the squared distances of $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are in $A_\mathfrak{p}$ and each squared distance is congruent to some constant $k \not\equiv 0 $ modulo $\mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$, then $|X| \leq d+2$, as shown by Nozaki (2023). In this paper, we prove that there exists a set $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ attaining the upper bound $|X| \leq d+2$ if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$ when the finite field $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic 2, and $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ when $A_\mathfrak{p}/ \mathfrak{p} A_\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic $p$ odd. We also provide examples attaining this upper bound.</description>

      <title>A Note on Extension Properties and Representations of Matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss several extension properties of matroids and polymatroids and their application as necessary conditions for the existence of different matroid representations, namely linear, folded linear, algebraic, and entropic representations. Iterations of those extension properties are checked for matroids on eight and nine elements by means of computer-aided explorations, finding in that way several new examples of non-linearly representable matroids. A special emphasis is made on sparse paving matroids on nine points containing the tic-tac-toe configuration. We present a new, more clear description of that family and we analyze extension properties on those matroids and their duals.</description>

      <title>Global rigidity of random graphs in $\mathbb{R}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of reconstructing a set $P\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of distinct points, where the only information available about $P$ consists of the distances between some of the pairs of points. More precisely, we examine which properties of the graph $G$ of known distances, defined on the vertex set $P$, ensure that $P$ can be uniquely reconstructed up to isometry. We prove that as soon as the random graph process has minimum degree 2, with high probability it can reconstruct all distances within any point set in $\mathbb{R}$. This resolves a conjecture of Benjamini and Tzalik. We also study the feasibility and limitations of reconstructing the distances within almost all points using much sparser random graphs. In doing so, we resolve a question posed by Gir\~ao, Illingworth, Michel, Powierski, and Scott.</description>

      <title>Generating functions for fixed points of the Mullineux map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mullineux defined an involution on the set of $e$-regular partitions of $n$. When $e=p$ is prime, these partitions label irreducible symmetric group modules in characteristic $p$. Mullineux's conjecture, since proven, was that this ``Mullineux map" described the effect on the labels of taking the tensor product with the one-dimensional signature representation. Counting irreducible modules fixed by this tensor product is related to counting irreducible modules for the alternating group $A_n$ in prime characteristic. In 1991, Andrews and Olsson worked out the generating function counting fixed points of Mullineux's map when $e=p$ is an odd prime (providing evidence in support of Mullineux's conjecture). In 1998, Bessenrodt and Olsson counted the fixed points in a $p$-block of weight $w$. We extend both results to arbitrary $e$, and determine the corresponding generating functions. When $e$ is odd but not prime the extension is immediate, while $e$ even requires additional work and the results, which are different, have not appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>Path eccentricity of $k$-AT-free graphs and application on graphs with the consecutive ones property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central path problem is a variation on the single facility location problem. The aim is to find, in a given connected graph $G$, a path $P$ minimizing its eccentricity, which is the maximal distance from $P$ to any vertex of the graph $G$. The path eccentricity of $G$ is the minimal eccentricity achievable over all paths in $G$. In this article we consider the path eccentricity of the class of the $k$-AT-free graphs. They are graphs in which any set of three vertices contains a pair for which every path between them uses at least one vertex of the closed neighborhood at distance $k$ of the third. We prove that they have path eccentricity bounded by $k$.
  Moreover, we answer a question of G\'omez and Guti\'errez asking if there is a relation between path eccentricity and the consecutive ones property. The latter is the property for a binary matrix to admit a permutation of the rows placing the 1's consecutively on the columns. It was already known that graphs whose adjacency matrices have the consecutive ones property have path eccentricity at most 1, and that the same remains true when the augmented adjacency matrices (with ones on the diagonal) has the consecutive ones property. We generalize these results as follow. We study graphs whose adjacency matrices can be made to satisfy the consecutive ones property after changing some values on the diagonal, and show that those graphs have path eccentricity at most 2, by showing that they are 2-AT-free.</description>

      <title>An activities expansion of the transition polynomial of a multimatroid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted transition polynomial of a multimatroid is a generalization of the Tutte polynomial. By defining the activity of a skew class with respect to a basis in a multimatroid, we obtain an activities expansion for the weighted transition polynomial. We also decompose the set of all transversals of a multimatroid as a union of subsets of transversals. Each term in the decomposition has the structure of a boolean lattice, and each transversal belongs to a number of terms depending only on the sizes of some of its skew classes. Further expressions for the transition polynomial of a multimatroid are obtained via an equivalence relation on its bases and by extending Kochol's theory of compatible sets.
  We apply our multimatroid results to obtain a result of Morse about the transition polynomial of a delta-matroid and get a partition of the boolean lattice of subsets of elements of a delta-matroid determined by the feasible sets. Finally, we describe how multimatroids arise from graphs embedded in surfaces and apply our results to obtain an activities expansion for the topological transition polynomial. Our work extends results for the Tutte polynomial of a matroid.</description>

      <title>A note on the 2-Factor Hamiltonicity Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2-factor Hamiltonicity Conjecture by Funk, Jackson, Labbate, and Sheehan [JCTB, 2003] asserts that all cubic, bipartite graphs in which all 2-factors are Hamiltonian cycles can be built using a simple operation starting from $K_{3,3}$ and the Heawood graph.
  We discuss the link between this conjecture and matching theory, in particular by showing that this conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the two exceptional graphs in the conjecture are the only cubic braces in which all 2-factors are Hamiltonian cycles, where braces are connected, bipartite graphs in which every matching of size at most two is contained in a perfect matching. In the context of matching theory this conjecture is especially noteworthy as $K_{3,3}$ and the Heawood graph are both strongly tied to the important class of Pfaffian graphs, with $K_{3,3}$ being the canonical non-Pfaffian graph and the Heawood graph being one of the most noteworthy Pfaffian graphs.
  Our main contribution is a proof that the Heawood graph is the only Pfaffian, cubic brace in which all 2-factors are Hamiltonian cycles. This is shown by establishing that, aside from the Heawood graph, all Pfaffian braces contain a cycle of length four, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: A (di)graph $\Gamma$ generates a commutative association scheme $\mathfrak{X}$ if and only if the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$ generates the Bose-Mesner algebra of $\mathfrak{X}$. In [17, Theorem 1.1], Monzillo and Penji\'{c} proved that, except for amorphic symmetric association schemes, every $3$-class association scheme can be generated by the adjacency matrix of a (di)graph. In this paper, we characterize when a commutative association scheme with exactly one pair of nonsymmetric relations can be generated by a digraph under certain assumptions. As an application, we show that each nonsymmetric $4$-class association scheme can be generated by a digraph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the cover number of a graph $G$ by a graph class $\mathcal P$ as the minimum number of graphs of class $\mathcal P$ required to cover the edge set of $G$. Taking inspiration from a paper by Harary, Hsu and Miller, we find an exact formula for the cover number by the graph classes $\{ G \mid \chi(G) \leq f(\omega(G))\}$ for an arbitrary non-decreasing function $f$.
  After this, we establish a chain of inequalities with five cover numbers, the one by the class $\{ G \mid \chi(G) = \omega(G)\}$, by the class of perfect graphs, generalized split graphs, co-unipolar graphs and finally by bipartite graphs. We prove that at each inequality, the difference between the two sides can grow arbitrarily large. We also prove that the cover number by unipolar graphs cannot be expressed in terms of the chromatic or the clique number.</description>

Abstract: Which polygons admit two (or more) distinct lattice tilings of the plane? We call such polygons double tiles. It is well-known that a lattice tiling is always combinatorially isomorphic either to a grid of squares or to a grid of regular hexagons. We focus on the special case of the double tile problem where both tilings are in the square class. For this special case, we give an explicit description of all double tiles. We establish the result for polyominoes first; then, with little additional effort, we extend the proof to general polygons. Central to the description is a certain finite set of transformations which we apply iteratively to a base shape in order to obtain one family of "fractal-like" polyominoes. The double tiles are then given by these polyominoes together with particular "deformations" of them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of claw-free planar graphs dates back to Plummer's work in 1989. Plummer showed that the maximum degree of every 3-connected claw-free planar graph is at most 6. In this paper, we first show that the bound holds for all, not necessarily 3-connected, claw-free planar graphs. We then establish an analogous result for claw-free 1-planar graphs. Specifically, we show that the maximum degree of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 10, and the bound is tight. In addition, we show that the maximum degree of claw-free optimal 1-planar graphs is at most 8. Finally, we determine the upper bound on the vertex-connectivity of claw-free 1-planar graphs, which implies that every 7-connected 1-planar graph contains induced claws.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Lovasz theta function via walk generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new characterization of the Lovasz theta function is provided by relating it to the (weighted) walk-generating function, thus establishing a relationship between two seemingly quite distinct concepts in algebraic graph theory. An application of this new characterization is given by showing how it straightforwardly entails multiple natural generalizations of the Hoffman upper bound (on both the independence number and Lovasz number) to arbitrary non-regular graphs. These new bounds possess properties that make them advantageous to previously derived such generalizations. It will also be shown that the Lovasz theta function equals a natural relaxation of the independence number, here dubbed the spherical independence number -- the determination of which involves producing a vector corresponding to a generalized maximum independent set which might be significant for the maximum independent set problem. Lastly, the derivation of the new characterization involves proving a certain analysis result which may in itself be of interest.</description>

      <title>On Strongly Regular Graphs and the Friendship Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative proof of the celebrated friendship theorem, originally established by Erd\H{o}s, R\'{e}nyi, and S\'{o}s (1966). The proof is based on a closed-form expression for the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of strongly regular graphs, which was recently derived by the author. Leveraging this expression, the paper also establishes new necessary conditions for a strongly regular graph to be a spanning subgraph or an induced subgraph of another strongly regular graph. In the case of induced subgraphs, the analysis further incorporates a property of graph energies.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Inequality on Three Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be upward closed set systems in the lattice of $\{0,1\}^n$. The celebrated Harris-Kleitman inequality implies that if $|X|=\alpha 2^n$, $|Y|=\beta 2^n$, the density of the set of points in exactly one of $X$ and $Y$ is maximal when $X$ and $Y$ are independent, meaning $|X\cap Y|=\alpha\beta 2^n$. Is the same true of three upward closed systems, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$? Suppose $|X|=|Y|=|Z|$. Kahn asked whether the set of points in exactly one of $X$, $Y$, $Z$ has density at most $\frac49$. We answer this question in the negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.10414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich and varied ways that genetic material can be passed between species has motivated extensive research into the theory of phylogenetic networks. Features that align with biological processes, or with desirable mathematical properties, have been used to define classes and prove results, with the goal of developing the theoretical foundations for network reconstruction methods. We may have now reached the point where a collection of recent results can be drawn together to make one class of network, the \emph{normal} networks, a leading contender, sitting in the sweet spot between biological relevance and mathematical tractability.</description>

      <title>On the action of the Weyl group on canonical bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study representations of simply-laced Weyl groups which are equipped with canonical bases. Our main result is that for a large class of representations, the separable elements of the Weyl group $W$ act on these canonical bases by bijections up to lower-order terms. Examples of this phenomenon include the action of separable permutations on the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of irreducible representations for the symmetric group, and the action of separable elements of $W$ on dual canonical bases of weight zero in tensor product representations of a Lie algebra. Our methods arise from categorical representation theory, and in particular the study of the perversity of Rickard complexes acting on triangulated categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conjugacy class growth function in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. That is, the number of elements in the ball of radius $n$ in the Cayley graph which intersect a fixed conjugacy class. In the class of virtually abelian groups, we prove that this function is always asymptotically equivalent to a polynomial. Furthermore, we show that in any affine Coxeter group, the degree of polynomial growth of a conjugacy class is equivalent to the reflection length of any element of that class.</description>

      <title>State Transfer and Readout Times for Trees of Diameter 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the state transfer properties of continuous time quantum walks on trees of diameter 4. We characterize all pairs of strongly cospectral vertices in trees of diameter 4, finding that they fall into pairs of three different types. For each type, we construct an infinite family of diameter 4 trees for which there is pretty good state transfer between the pair of strongly cospectral vertices. Moreover, for two of those types, for each tree in the infinite family, we give an explicit sequence of readout times at which the fidelity of state transfer converges to $1$. For strongly cospectral vertices of the remaining type, we identify a sequence of trees and explicit readout times so that the fidelity of state transfer between the strongly cospectral vertices approaches $1.$
  We also prove a result of independent interest: for a graph with the property that the fidelity of state transfer between a pair of vertices at time $t_k$ converges to $1$ as $k \rightarrow \infty,$ then the derivative of the fidelity at $t_k$ converges to $0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty. $</description>

      <title>Standard Lyndon loop words: weighted orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the study of standard Lyndon loop words from [A.Negut, A.Tsymbaliuk, "Quantum loop groups and shuffle algebras via Lyndon words", Adv. Math. 439 (2024), Paper No. 109482] to a more general class of orders on the underlying alphabet, as suggested in Remark 3.15 of loc.cit. The main new ingredient is the exponent-tightness of these words, which also allows to generalize the construction of PBW bases of the untwisted quantum loop algebra via the combinatorics of loop words.</description>

      <title>The CEGM NLSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying quantum field theories through geometric principles has revealed deep connections between physics and mathematics, including the discovery by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM) of a generalization of biadjoint scalar amplitudes. However, extending this to generalizations of other quantum field theories remains a central challenge. Recently it has been discovered that the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) emerges after a certain zero-preserving deformation from $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$. In this work, we find a much richer story of zero-preserving deformations in the CEGM context, yielding generalized NLSM amplitudes. We prove an explicit formula for the residual embedding of an $n$-point NLSM amplitude in a mixed $n+2$ point generalized NLSM amplitude, which provides a strong consistency check on our generalization. We show that the dimension of the space of pure kinematic deformations is $\gcd(k,n)-1$, we introduce a deformation-compatible modification of the Global Schwinger Parameterization, and we include a new proof, using methods from matroidal blade arrangements, of the linear independence for the set of planar kinematic invariants for CEGM amplitudes. Our framework is compatible with string theory through recent generalizations of the Koba-Nielsen string integral to any positive configuration space $X^+(k,n)$, where the usual Koba-Nielsen string integral corresponds to $X(2,n) = \mathcal{M}_{0,n}$.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets and variants in chordal bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal dominating sets with polynomial delay in bipartite graphs is a long-standing open problem. To date, even the subcase of chordal bipartite graphs is open, with the best known algorithm due to Golovach, Heggernes, Kant\'e, Kratsch, Saether, and Villanger running in incremental-polynomial time. We improve on this result by providing a polynomial delay and space algorithm enumerating minimal dominating sets in chordal bipartite graphs. Additionally, we show that the total and connected variants admit polynomial and incremental-polynomial delay algorithms, respectively, within the same class. This provides an alternative proof of a result by Golovach et al. for total dominating sets, and answers an open question for the connected variant. Finally, we give evidence that the techniques used in this paper cannot be generalized to bipartite graphs for (total) minimal dominating sets, unless P = NP, and show that enumerating minimal connected dominating sets in bipartite graphs is harder than enumerating minimal transversals in general hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>
