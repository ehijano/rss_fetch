      <title>Corrected Correlation Estimates for Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-analysis allows rigorous aggregation of estimates and uncertainty across multiple studies. When a given study reports multiple estimates, such as log odds ratios (ORs) or log relative risks (RRs) across exposure groups, accounting for within-study correlations improves accuracy and efficiency of meta-analytic results. Canonical approaches of Greenland-Longnecker and Hamling estimate pseudo cases and non-cases for exposure groups to obtain within-study correlations. However, currently available implementations for both methods fail on simple examples.
  We review both GL and Hamling methods through the lens of optimization. For ORs, we provide modifications of each approach that ensure convergence for any feasible inputs. For GL, this is achieved through a new connection to entropic minimization. For Hamling, a modification leads to a provably solvable equivalent set of equations given a specific initialization. For each, we provide implementations a guaranteed to work for any feasible input.
  For RRs, we show the new GL approach is always guaranteed to succeed, but any Hamling approach may fail: we give counter-examples where no solutions exist. We derive a sufficient condition on reported RRs that guarantees success when reported variances are all equal.</description>

      <title>Propensity Score Analysis with Guaranteed Subgroup Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the causal treatment effects by subgroups is important in observational studies when the treatment effect heterogeneity may be present. Existing propensity score methods rely on a correctly specified propensity score model. Model misspecification results in biased treatment effect estimation and covariate imbalance. We proposed a new algorithm, the propensity score analysis with guaranteed subgroup balance (G-SBPS), to achieve covariate mean balance in all subgroups. We further incorporated nonparametric kernel regression for the propensity scores and developed a kernelized G-SBPS (kG-SBPS) to improve the subgroup mean balance of covariate transformations in a rich functional class. This extension is more robust to propensity score model misspecification. Extensive numerical studies showed that G-SBPS and kG-SBPS improve both subgroup covariate balance and subgroup treatment effect estimation, compared to existing approaches. We applied G-SBPS and kG-SBPS to a dataset on right heart catheterization to estimate the subgroup average treatment effects on the hospital length of stay and a dataset on diabetes self-management training to estimate the subgroup average treatment effects for the treated on the hospitalization rate.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal patterns of diurnal temperature: a random matrix approach I-case of India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spatio-temporal gridded daily diurnal temperature range (DTR) data across India during the 72-year period 1951--2022. We augment this data with information on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and on the climatic regions (Stamp's and Koeppen's classification) and four seasons of India.
  We use various matrix theory approaches to trim out strong but routine signals, random matrix theory to remove noise, and novel empirical generalised singular-value distributions to establish retention of essential signals in the trimmed data. We make use of the spatial Bergsma statistics to measure spatial association and identify temporal change points in the spatial-association.
  In particular, our investigation captures a yet unknown change-point over the 72 years under study with drastic changes in spatial-association of DTR in India. It also brings out changes in spatial association with regard to ENSO.
  We conclude that while studying/modelling Indian DTR data, due consideration should be granted to the strong spatial association that is being persistently exhibited over decades, and provision should be kept for potential change points in the temporal behaviour, which in turn can bring moderate to dramatic changes in the spatial association pattern.
  Some of our analysis also reaffirms the conclusions made by other authors, regarding spatial and temporal behavior of DTR, adding our own insights. We consider the data from the yearly, seasonal and climatic zones points of view, and discover several new and interesting statistical structures which should be of interest, especially to climatologists and statisticians. Our methods are not country specific and could be used profitably for DTR data from other geographical areas.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric canonical correlation analysis of Riemannian and high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical model for the integrative analysis of Riemannian-valued functional data and high-dimensional data. We apply this model to explore the dependence structure between each subject's dynamic functional connectivity -- represented by a temporally indexed collection of positive definite covariance matrices -- and high-dimensional data representing lifestyle, demographic, and psychometric measures. Specifically, we employ a reformulation of canonical correlation analysis that enables efficient control of the complexity of the functional canonical directions using tangent space sieve approximations. Additionally, we enforce an interpretable group structure on the high-dimensional canonical directions via a sparsity-promoting penalty. The proposed method shows improved empirical performance over alternative approaches and comes with theoretical guarantees. Its application to data from the Human Connectome Project reveals a dominant mode of covariation between dynamic functional connectivity and lifestyle, demographic, and psychometric measures. This mode aligns with results from static connectivity studies but reveals a unique temporal non-stationary pattern that such studies fail to capture.</description>

      <title>Detection of a structural break in intraday volatility pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop theory leading to testing procedures for the presence of a change point in the intraday volatility pattern. The new theory is developed in the framework of Functional Data Analysis. It is based on a model akin to the stochastic volatility model for scalar point-to-point returns. In our context, we study intraday curves, one curve per trading day. After postulating a suitable model for such functional data, we present three tests focusing, respectively, on changes in the shape, the magnitude and arbitrary changes in the sequences of the curves of interest. We justify the respective procedures by showing that they have asymptotically correct size and by deriving consistency rates for all tests. These rates involve the sample size (the number of trading days) and the grid size (the number of observations per day). We also derive the corresponding change point estimators and their consistency rates. All procedures are additionally validated by a simulation study and an application to US stocks.</description>

      <title>Marginal Analysis of Count Time Series in the Presence of Missing Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series in real-world applications often have missing observations, making typical analytical methods unsuitable. One method for dealing with missing data is the concept of amplitude modulation. While this principle works with any data, here, missing data for unbounded and bounded count time series are investigated, where tailor-made dispersion and skewness statistics are used for model diagnostics. General closed-form asymptotic formulas are derived for such statistics with only weak assumptions on the underlying process. Moreover, closed-form formulas are derived for the popular special cases of Poisson and binomial autoregressive processes, always under the assumption that missingness occurs. The finite-sample performances of the considered asymptotic approximations are analyzed with simulations. The practical application of the corresponding dispersion and skewness tests under missing data is demonstrated with three real-data examples.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Longitudinal Disparities: an Application to the Fetal Growth-Singletons Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing health disparities among different demographic groups is a key challenge in public health. Despite many efforts, there is still a gap in understanding how these disparities unfold over time. Our paper focuses on this overlooked longitudinal aspect, which is crucial in both clinical and public health settings. In this paper, we introduce a longitudinal disparity decomposition method that decomposes disparities into three components: the explained disparity linked to differences in the exploratory variables' conditional distribution when the modifier distribution is identical between majority and minority groups, the explained disparity that emerges specifically from the unequal distribution of the modifier and its interaction with covariates, and the unexplained disparity. The proposed method offers a dynamic alternative to the traditional Peters-Belson decomposition approach, tackling both the potential reduction in disparity if the covariate distributions of minority groups matched those of the majority group and the evolving nature of disparity over time. We apply the proposed approach to a fetal growth study to gain insights into disparities between different race/ethnicity groups in fetal developmental progress throughout the course of pregnancy.</description>

      <title>Testing Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economists are often interested in the mechanisms by which a particular treatment affects an outcome. This paper develops tests for the ``sharp null of full mediation'' that the treatment $D$ operates on the outcome $Y$ only through a particular conjectured mechanism (or set of mechanisms) $M$. A key observation is that if $D$ is randomly assigned and has a monotone effect on $M$, then $D$ is a valid instrumental variable for the local average treatment effect (LATE) of $M$ on $Y$. Existing tools for testing the validity of the LATE assumptions can thus be used to test the sharp null of full mediation when $M$ and $D$ are binary. We develop a more general framework that allows one to test whether the effect of $D$ on $Y$ is fully explained by a potentially multi-valued and multi-dimensional set of mechanisms $M$, allowing for relaxations of the monotonicity assumption. We further provide methods for lower-bounding the size of the alternative mechanisms when the sharp null is rejected. An advantage of our approach relative to existing tools for mediation analysis is that it does not require stringent assumptions about how $M$ is assigned; on the other hand, our approach helps to answer different questions than traditional mediation analysis by focusing on the sharp null rather than estimating average direct and indirect effects. We illustrate the usefulness of the testable implications in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>(Empirical) Bayes Approaches to Parallel Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Bayes and Empirical Bayes (EB) approaches for dealing with violations of parallel trends. In the Bayes approach, the researcher specifies a prior over both the pre-treatment violations of parallel trends $\delta_{pre}$ and the post-treatment violations $\delta_{post}$. The researcher then updates their posterior about the post-treatment bias $\delta_{post}$ given an estimate of the pre-trends $\delta_{pre}$. This allows them to form posterior means and credible sets for the treatment effect of interest, $\tau_{post}$. In the EB approach, the prior on the violations of parallel trends is learned from the pre-treatment observations. We illustrate these approaches in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Redefining the Shortest Path Problem Formulation of the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model: Pairwise Likelihood Ratios, Prior Knowledge, and Path Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective causal discovery is essential for learning the causal graph from observational data. The linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) operates under the assumption of a linear data generating process with non-Gaussian noise in determining the causal graph. Its assumption of unmeasured confounders being absent, however, poses practical limitations. In response, empirical research has shown that the reformulation of LiNGAM as a shortest path problem (LiNGAM-SPP) addresses this limitation. Within LiNGAM-SPP, mutual information is chosen to serve as the measure of independence. A challenge is introduced - parameter tuning is now needed due to its reliance on kNN mutual information estimators. The paper proposes a threefold enhancement to the LiNGAM-SPP framework.
  First, the need for parameter tuning is eliminated by using the pairwise likelihood ratio in lieu of kNN-based mutual information. This substitution is validated on a general data generating process and benchmark real-world data sets, outperforming existing methods especially when given a larger set of features. The incorporation of prior knowledge is then enabled by a node-skipping strategy implemented on the graph representation of all causal orderings to eliminate violations based on the provided input of relative orderings. Flexibility relative to existing approaches is achieved. Last among the three enhancements is the utilization of the distribution of paths in the graph representation of all causal orderings. From this, crucial properties of the true causal graph such as the presence of unmeasured confounders and sparsity may be inferred. To some extent, the expected performance of the causal discovery algorithm may be predicted. The refinements above advance the practicality and performance of LiNGAM-SPP, showcasing the potential of graph-search-based methodologies in advancing causal discovery.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the invariant measure of a multidimensional diffusion from noisy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for estimating the invariant density of a multidimensional diffusion when dealing with high-frequency observations blurred by independent noises. We consider the intermediate regime, where observations occur at discrete time instances $k\Delta_n$ for $k=0,\dots,n$, under the conditions $\Delta_n\to 0$ and $n\Delta_n\to\infty$. Our methodology involves the construction of a kernel density estimator that uses a pre-averaging technique to proficiently remove noise from the data while preserving the analytical characteristics of the underlying signal and its asymptotic properties. The rate of convergence of our estimator depends on both the anisotropic regularity of the density and the intensity of the noise. We establish conditions on the intensity of the noise that ensure the recovery of convergence rates similar to those achievable without any noise. Furthermore, we prove a Bernstein concentration inequality for our estimator, from which we derive an adaptive procedure for the kernel bandwidth selection.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks with Causal Graph Constraints: A New Approach for Treatment Effects Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning techniques for the estimation of treatment effects. Most of the best-performing methods rely on representation learning strategies that encourage shared behavior among potential outcomes to increase the precision of treatment effect estimates. In this paper we discuss and classify these models in terms of their algorithmic inductive biases and present a new model, NN-CGC, that considers additional information from the causal graph. NN-CGC tackles bias resulting from spurious variable interactions by implementing novel constraints on models, and it can be integrated with other representation learning methods. We test the effectiveness of our method using three different base models on common benchmarks. Our results indicate that our model constraints lead to significant improvements, achieving new state-of-the-art results in treatment effects estimation. We also show that our method is robust to imperfect causal graphs and that using partial causal information is preferable to ignoring it.</description>

      <title>Debiased Distribution Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern compression methods can summarize a target distribution $\mathbb{P}$ more succinctly than i.i.d. sampling but require access to a low-bias input sequence like a Markov chain converging quickly to $\mathbb{P}$. We introduce a new suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratic time, Stein Kernel Thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb {P}$. For larger-scale compression tasks, Low-rank SKT achieves the same feat in sub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may be of independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex or constant-preserving weights, Stein Recombination and Stein Cholesky achieve even greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as $\operatorname{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are new guarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay of kernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. In our experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.</description>

      <title>Pretraining and the Lasso</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretraining is a popular and powerful paradigm in machine learning. As an example, suppose one has a modest-sized dataset of images of cats and dogs, and plans to fit a deep neural network to classify them from the pixel features. With pretraining, we start with a neural network trained on a large corpus of images, consisting of not just cats and dogs but hundreds of other image types. Then we fix all of the network weights except for the top layer (which makes the final classification) and train (or "fine tune") those weights on our dataset. This often results in dramatically better performance than the network trained solely on our smaller dataset.
  In this paper, we ask the question "Can pretraining help the lasso?". We develop a framework for the lasso in which an overall model is fit to a large set of data, and then fine-tuned to a specific task on a smaller dataset. This latter dataset can be a subset of the original dataset, but does not need to be. We find that this framework has a wide variety of applications, including stratified models, multinomial targets, multi-response models, conditional average treatment estimation and even gradient boosting.
  In the stratified model setting, the pretrained lasso pipeline estimates the coefficients common to all groups at the first stage, and then group specific coefficients at the second "fine-tuning" stage. We show that under appropriate assumptions, the support recovery rate of the common coefficients is superior to that of the usual lasso trained only on individual groups. This separate identification of common and individual coefficients can also be useful for scientific understanding.</description>

      <title>R-VGAL: A Sequential Variational Bayes Algorithm for Generalised Linear Mixed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models with random effects, such as generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), are often used for analysing clustered data. Parameter inference with these models is difficult because of the presence of cluster-specific random effects, which must be integrated out when evaluating the likelihood function. Here, we propose a sequential variational Bayes algorithm, called Recursive Variational Gaussian Approximation for Latent variable models (R-VGAL), for estimating parameters in GLMMs. The R-VGAL algorithm operates on the data sequentially, requires only a single pass through the data, and can provide parameter updates as new data are collected without the need of re-processing the previous data. At each update, the R-VGAL algorithm requires the gradient and Hessian of a "partial" log-likelihood function evaluated at the new observation, which are generally not available in closed form for GLMMs. To circumvent this issue, we propose using an importance-sampling-based approach for estimating the gradient and Hessian via Fisher's and Louis' identities. We find that R-VGAL can be unstable when traversing the first few data points, but that this issue can be mitigated by using a variant of variational tempering in the initial steps of the algorithm. Through illustrations on both simulated and real datasets, we show that R-VGAL provides good approximations to the exact posterior distributions, that it can be made robust through tempering, and that it is computationally efficient.</description>

Abstract: Are asymptotic confidence sequences and anytime $p$-values uniformly valid for a nontrivial class of distributions $\mathcal{P}$? We give a positive answer to this question by deriving distribution-uniform anytime-valid inference procedures. Historically, anytime-valid methods -- including confidence sequences, anytime $p$-values, and sequential hypothesis tests that enable inference at stopping times -- have been justified nonasymptotically. Nevertheless, asymptotic procedures such as those based on the central limit theorem occupy an important part of statistical toolbox due to their simplicity, universality, and weak assumptions. While recent work has derived asymptotic analogues of anytime-valid methods with the aforementioned benefits, these were not shown to be $\mathcal{P}$-uniform, meaning that their asymptotics are not uniformly valid in a class of distributions $\mathcal{P}$. Indeed, the anytime-valid inference literature currently has no central limit theory to draw from that is both uniform in $\mathcal{P}$ and in the sample size $n$. This paper fills that gap by deriving a novel $\mathcal{P}$-uniform strong Gaussian approximation theorem. We apply some of these results to obtain an anytime-valid test of conditional independence without the Model-X assumption, as well as a $\mathcal{P}$-uniform law of the iterated logarithm.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at AUROC and AUPRC under Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06091</link>

Abstract: In machine learning (ML), a widespread adage is that the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric for model comparison to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for binary classification tasks with class imbalance. This paper challenges this notion through novel mathematical analysis, illustrating that AUROC and AUPRC can be concisely related in probabilistic terms. We demonstrate that AUPRC, contrary to popular belief, is not superior in cases of class imbalance and might even be a harmful metric, given its inclination to unduly favor model improvements in subpopulations with more frequent positive labels. This bias can inadvertently heighten algorithmic disparities. Prompted by these insights, a thorough review of existing ML literature was conducted, utilizing large language models to analyze over 1.5 million papers from arXiv. Our investigation focused on the prevalence and substantiation of the purported AUPRC superiority. The results expose a significant deficit in empirical backing and a trend of misattributions that have fuelled the widespread acceptance of AUPRC's supposed advantages. Our findings represent a dual contribution: a significant technical advancement in understanding metric behaviors and a stark warning about unchecked assumptions in the ML community.

      <title>Composite likelihood inference for the Poisson log-normal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14390</link>

Abstract: Inferring parameters of a latent variable model can be a daunting task when the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observed ones is intractable. Variational approaches prove to be computationally efficient but, possibly, lack theoretical guarantees on the estimates, while sampling based solutions are quite the opposite. Starting from already available variational approximations, we define a first Monte Carlo EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimators, focusing on the Poisson log-normal model which provides a generic framework for the analysis of multivariate count data. We then extend this algorithm to the case of a composite likelihood in order to be able to handle higher dimensional count data.</description>

      <title>Effect of Systematic Uncertainties on Density and Temperature Estimates in Coronae of Capella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10427</link>

Abstract: We estimate the coronal density of Capella using the O VII and Fe XVII line systems in the soft X-ray regime that have been observed over the course of the Chandra mission. Our analysis combines measures of error due to uncertainty in the underlying atomic data with statistical errors in the Chandra data to derive meaningful overall uncertainties on the plasma density of the coronae of Capella. We consider two Bayesian frameworks. First, the so-called pragmatic-Bayesian approach considers the atomic data and their uncertainties as fully specified and uncorrectable. The fully-Bayesian approach, on the other hand, allows the observed spectral data to update the atomic data and their uncertainties, thereby reducing the overall errors on the inferred parameters. To incorporate atomic data uncertainties, we obtain a set of atomic data replicates, the distribution of which captures their uncertainty. A principal component analysis of these replicates allows us to represent the atomic uncertainty with a lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution. A $t$-distribution approximation of the uncertainties of a subset of plasma parameters including a priori temperature information, obtained from the temperature-sensitive-only Fe XVII spectral line analysis, is carried forward into the density- and temperature-sensitive O VII spectral line analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model fitting is implemented including Multi-step Monte Carlo Gibbs Sampler and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis recovers an isothermally approximated coronal plasma temperature of $\approx$5 MK and a coronal plasma density of $\approx$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, with uncertainties of 0.1 and 0.2 dex respectively.</description>
