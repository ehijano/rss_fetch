      <title>Kibble-Zurek Behavior in the Boundary-obstructed Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator when the system is slowly quenched across the boundary-obstructed phase transition, which is characterized by edge band gap closing.
  We find that the number of excitations produced after the quench exhibits power-law scaling behaviors with the quench rate. Boundary conditions can drastically modify the scaling behaviors: The scaling exponent is found to be $\alpha=1/2$ for hybridized and fully open boundary conditions, and $\alpha=2$ for periodic boundary condition. We argue that the exponent $\alpha=1/2$ cannot be explained by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism unless we adopt an effective dimension $d^{\rm eff}=1$ instead of the real dimension $d=2$. For comparison, we also investigate the slow quench dynamics across the bulk-obstructed phase transitions and a single multicritical point, which obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with dimension $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in single particle Brownian motion without drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) arise from qualitative changes in the long-time behavior of stochastic trajectories, often observed in systems with kinetic constraints or driven out of equilibrium. Here we demonstrate that first-order DPTs can occur even in the large deviations of a single Brownian particle without drift, but only when the system's dimensionality exceeds four. These DPTs are accompanied by temporal phase separations in the trajectories and exhibit dimension-dependent order due to the threshold behavior for bound state formation in Schr\"{o}dinger operators. We also discover second-order DPTs in one-dimensional Brownian motion, characterized by universal exponents in the rate function of dynamical observables. Our results establish a novel framework linking classical DPTs to quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Corrections of Electron-Phonon coupling for Second-Order Structural Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural phase transitions are accompanied by a movement of one nucleus (or a few) in the crystallographic unit cell. If the nucleus movement is continuous, a second order phase transition without latent heat results, whereas an abrupt nucleus displacement indicates a first order phase transition with accompanying latent heat. In this paper an Hamiltonian including electron-phonon coupling (EPC) as proposed by Kristoffel and Konsel\cite{Kristoffel1973} is taken. Contrary to their treatment, both the kinetic energy of the nucleus and its position are treated. The interaction of the many electron system with the single nucleus is taken into account by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and perturbative expressions for the free energies are derived. The nuclei corrections due to the entangled electrons are found to be minor, but highlight the importance of the symmetry breaking at low temperature. Furthermore the free energy for a canonical ensemble is computed, whereas Kristoffel and Konsel used a grand canonical ensemble, which allows to derive more stringent bounds on the free energy. For the zero-order nucleus correction the shift of the phase transition temperature by evaluating the free energy is deduced.</description>

      <title>Computational Phase Transitions in Two-Dimensional Antiferromagnetic Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational phase transition in a classical or quantum system is a non-analytic change in behavior of an order parameter which can only be observed with the assistance of a nontrivial classical computation. Such phase transitions, and the computational observables which detect them, play a crucial role in the optimal decoding of quantum error-correcting codes and in the scalable detection of measurement-induced phenomena. In this work we show that computational phase transitions and observables can also provide important physical insight on the phase diagram of a classical statistical physics system, specifically in the context of the dislocation-mediated melting of a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AF) crystal. In the solid phase, elementary dislocations disrupt the bipartiteness of the underlying square lattice, and as a result, pairs of dislocations are linearly confined by string-like AF domain walls. It has previously been argued that a novel AF tetratic phase can arise when double dislocations proliferate while elementary dislocations remain bound. However, since elementary dislocations carry AF Ising gauge flux, no local order parameter can distinguish between AF and paramagnetic (PM) tetratic regimes, and consequently there is no thermodynamic phase transition separating the two regimes. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to algorithmically construct a staggered magnetization which distinguishes the AF and PM tetratic regimes by "pairing" dislocations, which requires an increasingly nontrivial classical computation as elementary dislocation pairs increase in density and unbind. We discuss both algorithm-dependent and "intrinsic" algorithm-independent computational phase transitions in this setting, the latter of which includes a transition in one's ability to consistently sort atoms into two sublattices to construct a well-defined staggered magnetization.</description>

      <title>Optimal closed-loop control of active particles and a minimal information engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To establish general principles of optimal control of active matter, we study the elementary problem of moving an active particle by a trap with minimum work input. We show analytically that (open-loop) optimal protocols are not affected by activity, but work fluctuations are always increased. For closed-loop protocols, which rely on initial measurements of the self-propulsion, the average work has a minimum for a finite persistence time. Using these insights, we derive an optimal cyclic active information engine, which is found to have a higher precision and information efficiency when operated with a run-and-tumble particle than for an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and, we argue, than for any other type of active particle.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in driven periodic systems: from weak to strong damping regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider diffusion of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential and driven by an unbiased time periodic force of a moderate frequency. The study is focused on the dependence of its diffusion coefficient $D$ on the damping $\gamma$ ranging from the weak to strong one. We reveal the mechanisms of counterintutive effects in which diffusion can increase despite the grow of friction and exhibits both minima and maxima. Their origin is explained by analysis of the deterministic dynamics perturbed by thermal fluctuations. In the weak damping regime the maximum of diffusion is induced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits when the friction increases. In the strong dissipation regime the effect is caused by bifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating symmetrically around the potential maximum and their displacement towards the potential minimum when the damping coefficient increases. It induces the change of the effective barrier of the periodic potential and its vanishing at the maximum of $D$.</description>

      <title>Tuning the kinetics of intracellular transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of complex mechanisms, from chemical reaction pathways to active fluctuations, orchestrate molecular transport in intracellular environments. Despite significant recent progress in visualizing and probing these processes, little is known about how tunable the resulting dynamics is through external physical controllers. Here, we demonstrate that coarse-grained, reinforcement learning-based protocols can be developed to achieve highly localized and targeted cargo transport by kinesin motors on intracellular tracks. These protocols can be implemented in practice using optical tweezers, and their feasibility is showcased within experimentally relevant parameter regimes. Our results open new avenues for targeted control of intracellular transport processes, especially when opportunities for control are limited.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in (2 + 1)D subsystem-symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of unitary evolution and projective measurements is a modern interest in the study of many-body entanglement. On the one hand, the competition between these two processes leads to the recently-discovered measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). On the other, measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a well-known computational model studying how measurements simulate unitary evolution utilizing the entanglement of special resources such as the 2D cluster state. The entanglement properties enabling MBQC may be attributed to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders, particularly subsystem symmetric (SSPT) orders. It was recently found that the 1D cluster state may be associated with an SPT phase in random circuits respecting a global $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry, and furthermore that all phase transitions in this scenario belong to the same universality class. As resources with greater computational power feature greater symmetry, it is fruitful to investigate further any relationship between levels of symmetry in MIPTs and MBQC. In this paper we investigate MIPTs on a torus with three levels of symmetry-respecting unitary evolution interspersed by measurements. Although we find two area-law phases and one volume-law phase with distinct entanglement structures for each ensemble, the phase transition from the volume-law phase to the area-law phase associated with the 2D cluster state has variable correlation length exponent $\nu$. Whereas $\nu\approx 0.90$ for unconstrained Clifford unitaries and $\nu\approx 0.83$ for globally-symmetric Cliffords, subsystem-symmetric Cliffords feature a much smaller value $\nu\approx 0.38$. It is speculated that the hierarchy of distinct transitions seen in these random monitored quantum circuit models might have consequences for computational universality in MBQC.</description>

      <title>Comparison of integral equation theories of the liquid state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ornstein-Zernike equation is a powerful tool in liquid state theory for predicting structural and thermodynamic properties of fluids. Combined with a suitable closure, it has been shown to reproduce e.g. the static structure factor, pressure, and compressibility of liquids to a great degree of accuracy. However, out of the multitude of closures that exist for the Ornstein-Zernike equation, it is hard to predict a priori which closure will give the most accurate predictions for the system at hand. To alleviate this problem, we compare the predictive power of many closures on a curated set of representative benchmark systems, including those with hard-sphere, inverse power-law, Gaussian core, and Lennard-Jones particles, in three and two dimensions. For example, we find that the well-known and highly used Percus-Yevick closure gives significantly worse predictions than lesser-known closures of equal complexity in all cases studied. We anticipate that the trends observed in our results will aid in making more informed decisions regarding closure choices. To facilitate the adoption of more modern closure theories, we also have packaged, documented, and distributed the code necessary to numerically solve the equations for a given closure and pair interaction potential.</description>

      <title>Hybrid particle-phase field model and renormalized surface tension in dilute suspensions of nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-phase field model and a hybrid particle-phase field model to simulate dilute colloidal sedimentation and flotation near a liquid-gas interface (or fluid-fluid interface in general). Both models are coupled to the incompressible Stokes equation, which is solved numerically using a combination of sine and regular Fourier transforms to account for the no-slip boundary conditions at the boundaries. The continuum two-phase field model allows us to analytically solve the equilibrium interfacial profile using a perturbative approach, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Notably, we show that strong coupling to particle dynamics can significantly alter the liquid-gas interface, thereby modifying the liquid-gas interfacial tension. In particular, we show that the renormalized surface tension is monotonically decreasing with increasing colloidal particle concentration and decreasing buoyant mass.</description>

Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a sampling algorithm relying on a collective variable (CV) of mid-size dimension modelled by a normalizing flow and using non-equilibrium dynamics to propose full configurational moves from the proposition of a refreshed value of the CV made by the flow. The algorithm takes the form of a Markov chain with non-local updates, allowing jumps through energy barriers across metastable states. The flow is trained throughout the algorithm to reproduce the free energy landscape of the CV. The output of the algorithm are a sample of thermalized configurations and the trained network that can be used to efficiently produce more configurations. We show the functioning of the algorithm first on a test case with a mixture of Gaussians. Then we successfully test it on a higher dimensional system consisting in a polymer in solution with a compact and an extended stable state separated by a high free energy barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like the letters in the alphabet forming words, reusing components of a heterogeneous mixture is an efficient strategy for assembling a large number of target structures. Examples range from synthetic DNA origami to proteins self-assembling into complexes. The standard self-assembly paradigm views target structures as free-energy minima of a mixture. While this is an appealing picture, at high speed structures may be kinetically trapped in local minima, reducing self-assembly accuracy. How then can high speed, high accuracy, and combinatorial usage of components coexist? We propose to reconcile these three concepts not by avoiding kinetic traps, but by exploiting them to encode target structures. This can be achieved by sculpting the kinetic pathways of the mixture, instead of its free-energy landscape. We formalize these ideas in a minimal toy model, for which we analytically estimate the encoding capacity and kinetic characteristics, in agreement with simulations. Our results may be generalized to other soft-matter systems capable of computation, such as liquid mixtures or elastic networks, and pave the way for high-dimensional information processing far from equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We study mass-type surface defects in a free scalar and Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ theories. We obtain exact results for the free scalar defect, including its RG flow and defect Weyl anomaly. We classify phases of such defects at the WF fixed point near four dimensions, whose perturbative RG flow is investigated. We propose an IR effective action for the non-perturbative regime and check its self-consistency.</description>

      <title>Machine learning analysis of dimensional reduction conjecture for nonequilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently proposed dimensional reduction conjecture in driven disordered systems using a machine learning technique. The conjecture states that a static snapshot of a disordered system driven at a constant velocity is equal to a space-time trajectory of its lower-dimensional pure counterpart. This suggests that the three-dimensional (3D) random field XY model exhibits the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition when driven out of equilibrium. To verify the conjecture directly by observing configurations of the system, we utilize the capacity of neural networks to detect subtle features of images. Specifically, we train neural networks to differentiate snapshots of the 3D driven random field XY model from space-time trajectories of the two-dimensional pure XY model. Our results demonstrate that the network cannot distinguish between the two, confirming the dimensional reduction conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>
