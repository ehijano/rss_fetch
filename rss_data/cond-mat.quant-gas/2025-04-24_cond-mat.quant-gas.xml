      <title>Synthetic Horizons and Thermalization in an Atomic Chain and its Relation to Quantum Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sine model, a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian featuring hoppings with a sinusoidal dependence on position, and demonstrate the formation of synthetic horizons where electronic wave packets exhibit exponential slowdown. Interestingly, employing the exact transformation between this model and the Harper equation, which describes the eigenstates of a square lattice tight-binding model subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, we find that analogous semi-classical horizons can emerge in a quantum Hall setup at half-filling for specific values of the magnetic flux. Furthermore, by applying sudden quenches to the sine model's hopping profile, we observe the emergence of thermal states characterized by an Unruh temperature. Our numerical calculations of this temperature reveal a non-universal behavior, suggesting the involvement of physical mechanisms beyond a simple low-energy description.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the idea of quantum turbulence was first proposed by Feynman, and later realized in experiments of superfluid helium and Bose-Einstein condensates, much emphasis has been put in finding signatures that distinguish quantum turbulence from its classical counterpart. Here we show that quantum turbulence in rotating condensates is fundamentally different from the classical case. While rotating quantum turbulence develops a negative temperature state with self-organization of the kinetic energy in quantized vortices, it also displays an anisotropic dissipation mechanism and a different, non-Kolmogorovian, scaling of the energy at small scales. This scaling is compatible with Vinen turbulence and is also found in recent simulations of condensates with multicharged vortices. An elementary explanation for the scaling is presented in terms of disorder in the vortices positions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field suppression of tomographic electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wave numbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F\"orster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</description>
