      <title>Dynamic renormalization of scalar active field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Active Model B+, a scalar field theory extending the paradigmatic Model B for equilibrium coexistence through including terms that do not arise from an underlying free energy functional and thus break detailed balance. In the first part of the manuscript, we provide a pedagogical and self-contained introduction to one-loop dynamic renormalization. We then address the technical challenge of complex vertex functions through developing a symbolic computer algebra code that allows us to obtain the graphical corrections of model parameters. We argue that the additional terms of Active Model B+ imply the generation of, potentially relevant, higher-order terms; strongly restricting the parameter regime in which we can apply a perturbative renormalization scheme. Moreover, we elucidate the role of the cubic coefficient, which, in contrast to passive Model B, is incessantly generated by the new terms. Analyzing its behavior with and without field shift near the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find that additional fixed points in the one-loop flow equations are likely artifacts. Additionally, we characterize the renormalization flow of perturbatively accessible field theories derived from Active Model B+.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from unitary dynamics in generic quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the preparation of a quantum state using a circuit of depth $t$ from a factorized state of $N$ sites. We argue that in the appropriate scaling limit of large $t$ and $N$, the overlap between states evolved under generic many-body chaotic dynamics belongs to a family of universal distribution that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. This is a consequence of a mapping in the space of replicas to a model of dilute domain walls. Our result provides a rare example in which analysis at an arbitrary number of replicas is possible, giving rise to the complete overlap distribution. Our general picture is derived and corroborated by the exact solution of the random phase model and of an emergent random matrix model given by the Ginibre ensemble. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics at the Quantum-Classical Boundary: A Self-Consistent Framework Based on Adiabatic-Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic thermal machines promise to play an important role in future quantum technologies. Making such devices widely applicable will require effective strategies to channel their output into easily accessible storage systems like classical degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that makes it possible to model such quantum-classical hybrid devices in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Our approach is based on the assumption that the quantum part of the device is subject to strong decoherence and dissipation induced by a thermal reservoir. Due to the ensuing separation of time scales between slowly evolving classical and fast relaxing quantum degrees of freedom, the dynamics of the hybrid system can be described by means of adiabatic-response theory. We show that, upon including fluctuations in a minimally consistent way, the resulting equations of motion can be equipped with a first and second law, both on the ensemble level and on the level of individual trajectories of the classical part of the system, where thermodynamic quantities like heat and work become stochastic variables. As an application of our theory, we work out a physically transparent model of a quantum-classical hybrid engine, whose working system consists of a chain of Rydberg atoms, which is confined in an optical cavity and driven by periodic temperature variations. We show by means of numerical simulations that the engine can sustain periodic oscillations of a movable mirror, which acts as a classical load, against external friction and extract the full distributions of input heat and output work. By making the statistics of thermodynamic processes in quantum-classical hybrid systems accessible without the need to further specify a measurement protocol, our work contributes towards bridging the long-standing gap between classical and quantum stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong Markov dissipation in driven-dissipative quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation, which describes Markovian quantum dynamics under dissipation, is usually derived under the weak system-bath coupling assumption. Strong system-bath coupling often leads to non-Markov evolution. The singular-coupling limit is known as an exception: it yields a Lindblad equation with an arbitrary strength of dissipation. However, the singular-coupling limit requires high-temperature limit of the bath, and hence the system ends up in a trivial infinite-temperature state, which is not desirable in the context of quantum control. In this work, it is shown that we can derive a Markovian Lindblad equation for an arbitrary strength of the system-bath coupling by considering a new scaling limit that is called the singular-driving limit, which combines the singular-coupling limit and fast periodic driving. In contrast to the standard singular-coupling limit, an interplay between dissipation and periodic driving results in a nontrivial steady state.</description>

      <title>A bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes: from hard walls to absorbing boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. We show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Quantum effective dynamics of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics described by the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra. Our formulation of the effective theory is based in the standard procedure in conformal field theory, in which the Hilbert space is completely known a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the sym- metry algebra, and not by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian. For the purposes of comparison with alternative effective theories based on quantum hydrodynamics, we consider one chirality and study the hamiltonian equation of motion of the density field, which is shown to obey the quantum Benjamin- Ono equation, in agreement with previous hydrodynamic results. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. We consider this result to be a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoric and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <title>Onsager's "Ideal Turbulence" Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lars Onsager in 1945-1949 made an exact analysis of the high Reynolds-number limit for individual turbulent flow realizations modeled by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, motivated by experimental observations that dissipation of kinetic energy does not vanish. I review here developments spurred by his key idea, that such flows are well-described by distributional or "weak" solutions of ideal Euler equations. 1/3 H\"older singularities of the velocity field were predicted by Onsager and since observed. His theory describes turbulent energy cascade without probabilistic assumptions and yields a local, deterministic version of the Kolmogorov 4/5th law. The approach is closely related to renormalization group methods in physics and envisages "conservation-law anomalies", as discovered later in quantum field theory. There are also deep connections with Large-Eddy Simulation modeling. More recently, dissipative Euler solutions of the type conjectured by Onsager have been constructed and his 1/3 H\"older singularity proved to be the sharp threshold for anomalous dissipation. This progress has been achieved by an unexpected connection with work of John Nash on isometric embeddings of low regularity or "convex integration" techniques. The dissipative Euler solutions yielded by this method are wildly non-unique for fixed initial data, suggesting "spontaneously stochastic" behavior of high-Reynolds number solutions. I focus in particular on applications to wall-bounded turbulence, leading to novel concepts of spatial cascades of momentum, energy and vorticity to or from the wall as deterministic, space-time local phenomena. This theory thus makes testable predictions and offers new perspectives on Large-Eddy Simulation in presence of solid walls.</description>

      <title>Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal forces violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, much less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive the fundamental field theory of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from microscopic dynamics, leading to a generic framework termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this intrinsic nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between force nonreciprocity and competition. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

Abstract: Can many-body systems be beneficial to designing quantum technologies?

      <title>Quantum phase transition and critical behavior between the gapless topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase transition between gapped topological phases represents a class of unconventional criticality beyond the Landau paradigm. However, recent research has shifted attention to topological phases without a bulk gap, where the phase transitions between them are still elusive. In this work, based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group techniques, we investigate the critical behaviors of the extended quantum XXZ model obtained by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation. Using fidelity susceptibility as a diagnostic, we obtain a complete phase diagram, which includes both topological nontrivial and trivial gapless phases. Furthermore, as the XXZ-type anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ varies, both the critical points $h_c$ and correlation length exponent $\nu$ remain the same as in the $\Delta=0$ case, characterized by $c=3/2$ (Ising + free boson) conformal field theory. Our results indicate that fidelity susceptibility can effectively detect and reveal a stable unconventional critical line between the topologically distinct gapless phases for general $\Delta$. This work serves as a valuable reference for further research on phase transitions within the gapless topological phase of matter.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary dynamics of a quantum system initialized in a selected basis state yields, generically, a state that is a superposition of all the basis states. This process, associated with the quantum information scrambling and intimately tied to the resource theory of coherence, may be viewed as a gradual delocalization of the system's state in the Hilbert space. This work analyzes the Hilbert space delocalization under dynamics of random quantum circuits, which serve as a minimal model of chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems. We employ analytical methods based on the replica trick and Weingarten calculus to investigate the time evolution of the participation entropies which quantify the Hilbert space delocalization. We demonstrate that the participation entropies approach, up to a fixed accuracy, their long-time saturation value in times that scale logarithmically with the system size. Exact numerical simulations and tensor network techniques corroborate our findings.</description>

Abstract: Animal behavior is shaped by a myriad of mechanisms acting on a wide range of scales, which hampers quantitative reasoning and the identification of general principles. Here, we combine data analysis and theory to investigate the relationship between behavioral plasticity and heavy-tailed statistics often observed in animal behavior. Specifically, we first leverage high-resolution recordings of C. elegans locomotion to show that stochastic transitions among long-lived behaviors exhibit heavy-tailed first passage time distributions and correlation functions. Such heavy tails can be explained by slow adaptation of behavior over time. This particular result motivates our second step of introducing a general model where we separate fast dynamics on a quasi-stationary multi-well potential, from non-ergodic, slowly varying modes. We then show that heavy tails generically emerge in such a model, and we provide a theoretical derivation of the resulting functional form, which can become a power law with exponents that depend on the strength of the fluctuations. Finally, we provide direct support for the generality of our findings by testing them in a C. elegans mutant where adaptation is suppressed and heavy tails thus disappear, and recordings of larval zebrafish swimming behavior where heavy tails are again prevalent.</description>

      <title>Bounding the approach to oligarchy in a variant of the yard-sale model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the Gini coefficient of economic inequality under the dynamics of a modified Yard-Sale Model of kinetic asset exchange. A variant of the Yard-Sale Model is introduced by modifying the underlying binary transaction of the classical system. It is shown that the Gini coefficient is monotone under the resulting dynamics but the approach to oligarchy, as measured by the Gini index, can be bounded by a first-order differential inequality used in conjunction with the differential Gronwall inequality. This result is in the spirit of entropy -- entropy production inequalities for diffusive PDE. The asymptotics of the modified system, with a redistributive tax, are derived and shown to agree with the original, taxed Yard-Sale Model, which implies the modified system is as suitable for matching real wealth distributions. The Gini -- Gini production inequality is shown to hold for a broader class of models.</description>

      <title>Escaping fronts in local quenches of a confining spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider local quenches from initial states generated by a single spin-flip in either the true or the false vacuum state of the confining quantum Ising spin chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Contrary to global quenches, where the light-cone behaviour is strongly suppressed, we find a significant light-cone signal propagating with a nonzero velocity besides the expected localised oscillating component. Combining an analytic representation of the initial state with a numerical description of the relevant excitations using the two-fermion approximation, we can construct the spectrum of post-quench excitations and their overlaps with the initial state, identifying the underlying mechanism. For confining quenches built upon the true vacuum, the propagating signal consists of superpositions of left and right-moving mesons escaping confinement. In contrast, for anti-confining quenches built upon the false vacuum it is composed of superpositions of left and right-moving bubbles which escape Wannier-Stark localisation.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of a phase transition in the dynamics of interacting populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-variable differential equations with random coefficients provide powerful models for the dynamics of many interacting species in ecology. These models are known to exhibit a dynamical phase transition from a phase where population sizes reach a fixed point, to a phase where they fluctuate indefinitely. Here we provide a theory for the critical behavior close to the phase transition. We show that timescales diverge at the transition and that temporal fluctuations grow continuously upon crossing it. We further show the existence of three different universality classes, with different sets of critical exponents, depending on the migration rate which couples the system to its surroundings.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Poincar\'e recurrence time and irreversibility in Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the important questions in statistical mechanics is how irreversibility (time's arrow) occurs when Newton equations of motion are time reversal invariant. One objection to irreversibility is based on Poincar\'e's recursion theorem: a classical hamiltonian confined system returns after some time, so-called Poincar\'e recurrence time (PRT), close to its initial configuration. Boltzmann's reply was that for a $N \sim 10^{23} $ macroscopic number of particles, PRT is very large and exceeds the age of the universe. In this paper we compute for the first time, by two different methods, a typical recurrence time $ T(N)$ for a gas of $N$ particles. The first method is the molecular dynamics simulation. We find that $T(N) \sim N^z \exp (y N) $ and determine the exponents $y$ and $z$ for different values of the particle density and temperature. The second method based on Boltzmann's definition of the entropy as phase space volume associated to a macroscopic state, allows to compute $y$ analytically.
  We find an excellent agreement with the simulation in full accordance with Boltzmann's hypotheses, and establish that that $T(N) $ exceeds the age of the Universe for a relatively small number of particles, much smaller than $ 10^{23} $.</description>

      <title>Subspace restricted thermalization in a correlated-hopping model with strong Hilbert space fragmentation characterized by irreducible strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions in which a particle can hop between two neighboring sites only if the sites to the left and right of those two sites have different particle numbers. Using a bond-to-site mapping, this model involving four-site terms can be mapped to an assisted pair-flipping model involving only three-site terms. This model shows strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). We define irreducible strings (IS) to label the different fragments, determine the number of fragments, and the sizes of fragments corresponding to some special IS. In some classes of fragments, the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized completely, and in others it can be seen to have a structure characteristic of models which are not fully integrable. In the largest fragment in our model, the number of states grows exponentially with the system size, but the ratio of this number to the total Hilbert space size tends to zero exponentially in the thermodynamic limit. Within this fragment, we provide numerical evidence that only a weak version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) remains valid; we call this subspace-restricted ETH. To understand the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the model, we study the infinite-temperature time-dependent autocorrelation functions starting from a random initial state; we find that these exhibit a different behavior near the boundary compared to the bulk. Finally we propose an experimental setup to realize our correlated-hopping model.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Bound for Canonical Nonlinearity Under Single-Shot Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We derive the bound for the extended nonlinearity in nonequilibrium state, characterized by the nonlinearity in equilibrium state, Renyi alpha-divergence between equilibrium and nonequilibrium distribution, temperature and work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the stability conditions for a system of interacting fermions that conventionally involve variations of thermodynamic potentials can be rewritten in terms of local one- and two-particle correlators. We illustrate the applicability of this alternative formulation in a multi-orbital model of strongly correlated electrons at finite temperatures, inspecting the lowest eigenvalues of the generalized local charge susceptibility in proximity of the phase-separation region. Additionally to the conventional unstable branches, we address unstable solutions possessing a positive, rather than negative compressibility. Our stability conditions require no derivative of free energy functions with conceptual and practical advantages for actual calculations and offer a clear-cut criterion for analyzing the thermodynamics of correlated complex systems.</description>

      <title>Kinetic glass transition in granular gases and non-linear molecular fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate, both analytically and numerically, the emergence of a kinetic glass transition in two different model systems: a uniformly heated granular gas and a molecular fluid with nonlinear drag. Despite the profound differences between these two physical systems, their behavior in thermal cycles share strong similarities, which stem from the relaxation time diverging algebraically at low temperatures for both systems. When the driving intensity -- -for the granular gas -- or the bath temperature -- for the molecular fluid -- is decreased to sufficiently low values, the kinetic temperature of both systems becomes ``frozen" at a value that depends on the cooling rate through a power law with the same exponent. Interestingly, this frozen glassy state is universal in the following sense: for a suitable rescaling of the relevant variables, its velocity distribution function becomes independent of the cooling rate. Upon reheating, i.e., when either the driving intensity or the bath temperature is increased from this frozen state, hysteresis cycles arise and the apparent heat capacity displays a maximum. The numerical results obtained from the simulations are well described by a perturbative approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lindbladian formalism, as tuned to dissipative and open systems, has been all-pervasive to interpret non-equilibrium steady states of quantum many-body systems. We study the fate of free fermionic and superconducting phases in a dissipative one-dimensional Kitaev model - where the bath acts both as a source and a sink of fermionic particles with different coupling rates. As a function of these two couplings, we investigate the steady state, its entanglement content, and its approach from varying initial states. Interestingly, we find that the steady state phase diagram retains decipherable signatures of ground state critical physics. We also show that early-time fidelity is a useful marker to find a subclass of phase transitions in such situations. Moreover, we show that the survival of critical signatures at late-times, strongly depend on the thermal nature of the steady state. This connection hints at a correspondence between quantum observables and classical magnetism in the steady state of such systems. Our work uncovers interesting connections between dissipative quantum many-body systems, thermalization of a classical spin and many-body quantum critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dynamical invariant based shortcut to equilibration in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using the dynamical invariant also known as the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant, to speed-up the equilibration of a driven open quantum system. This allows us to reverse engineer the time-dependent master equation that describes the dynamics of the open quantum system and systematically derive a protocol that realizes a shortcut to equilibration. The method does not require additional constraints on the timescale of the dynamics beside the Born-Markov approximation and can be generically applied to boost single particle quantum engines significantly. We demonstrate it with the damped harmonic oscillator, and show that our protocol can achieve a high-fidelity control in shorter timescales than simple non-optimized protocols. We find that the system is heated during the dynamics to speed-up the equilibration, which can be considered as an analogue of the Mpemba effect in quantum control.</description>

      <title>Delayed interactions in the noisy voter model through the periodic polling mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of delayed interactions on the stationary distribution of the noisy voter model. We assume that the delayed interactions occur through the periodic polling mechanism and replace the original instantaneous two-agent interactions. In our analysis, we require that the polling period aligns with the delay in announcing poll outcomes. As expected, when the polling period is relatively short, the model with delayed interactions is almost equivalent to the original model. As the polling period increases, oscillatory behavior emerges, but the model with delayed interactions still converges to stationary distribution. The stationary distribution resembles a Beta-binomial distribution, with its shape parameters scaling with the polling period. The observed scaling behavior is non-monotonic. Namely, the shape parameters peak at some intermediate polling period.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the spiral spin liquid and surrounding phases in the square lattice XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiral spin liquids possess a subextensively degenerate ground-state manifold, represented by a continuum of energy minima in reciprocal space. Since a small change of the spiral state wavevector requires a global change of the spin configuration in real space, it is a priori unclear how such systems can fluctuate within the degenerate ground state manifold. Only recently it was proposed that momentum vortices are responsible for the liquidity of the spiral phase and that these systems are closely related to an emergent rank-2 U(1) gauge theory [H. Yan and J. Reuther, Phys. Rev. Research 4, 023175 (2022)]. As a consequence of this gauge structure, four-fold pinch-point singularities were found in a generalized spin correlator. In this article, we use classical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics calculations to embed the previously studied spiral spin liquid into a broader phase diagram of the square lattice XY model. We find a multitude of unusual phases and phase transitions surrounding the spiral spin liquid such as an effective four-state Potts transition into a colinear double-striped phase resulting from the spontaneous breaking of two coupled $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. Since this phase is stabilized by entropic effects selecting the momenta away from the spiral manifold, it undergoes a re-entrance phenomenon at low temperatures into a nematic spiral phase. We also observe a region of parameters where the phase transition into the spiral spin liquid does not break any symmetries and where the critical exponents do not match those of standard universality classes. We study the importance of momentum vortices in driving this phase transition and discuss the possibility of a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of momentum vortices. Finally, we explore the regime where the rank-2 U(1) gauge theory is valid by investigating the four-fold pinch point singularities across the phase diagram</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.08 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. It is suggested that HQDL has relevance to the non-superfluid states of confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems which are semi-Boltzmann-like owing to the suppression of Bosonic correlation.</description>
