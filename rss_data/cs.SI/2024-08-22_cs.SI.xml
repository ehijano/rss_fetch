      <title>A Thorough Comparison Between Independent Cascade and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cascades in social networks with the independent cascade (IC) model and the Susceptible-Infected-recovered (SIR) model. The well-studied IC model fails to capture the feature of node recovery, and the SIR model is a variant of the IC model with the node recovery feature. In the SIR model, by computing the probability that a node successfully infects another before its recovery and viewing this probability as the corresponding IC parameter, the SIR model becomes an "out-going-edge-correlated" version of the IC model: the events of the infections along different out-going edges of a node become dependent in the SIR model, whereas these events are independent in the IC model. In this paper, we thoroughly compare the two models and examine the effect of this extra dependency in the SIR model. By a carefully designed coupling argument, we show that the seeds in the IC model have a stronger influence spread than their counterparts in the SIR model, and sometimes it can be significantly stronger. Specifically, we prove that, given the same network, the same seed sets, and the parameters of the two models being set based on the above-mentioned equivalence, the expected number of infected nodes at the end of the cascade for the IC model is weakly larger than that for the SIR model, and there are instances where this dominance is significant. We also study the influence maximization problem with the SIR model. We show that the above-mentioned difference in the two models yields different seed-selection strategies, which motivates the design of influence maximization algorithms specifically for the SIR model. We design efficient approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees by adapting the reverse-reachable-set-based algorithms, commonly used for the IC model, to the SIR model.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Combining Objective and Subjective Perspectives for Political News Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers and practitioners interested in computational politics rely on automatic content analysis tools to make sense of the large amount of political texts available on the Web. Such tools should provide objective and subjective aspects at different granularity levels to make the analyses useful in practice. Existing methods produce interesting insights for objective aspects, but are limited for subjective ones, are often limited to national contexts, and have limited explainability. We introduce a text analysis framework which integrates both perspectives and provides a fine-grained processing of subjective aspects. Information retrieval techniques and knowledge bases complement powerful natural language processing components to allow a flexible aggregation of results at different granularity levels. Importantly, the proposed bottom-up approach facilitates the explainability of the obtained results. We illustrate its functioning with insights on news outlets, political orientations, topics, individual entities, and demographic segments. The approach is instantiated on a large corpus of French news, but is designed to work seamlessly for other languages and countries.</description>

      <title>Parallel Algorithms for Median Consensus Clustering in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm that finds the consensus of many different clustering solutions of a graph. We formulate the problem as a median set partitioning problem and propose a greedy optimization technique. Unlike other approaches that find median set partitions, our algorithm takes graph structure into account and finds a comparable quality solution much faster than the other approaches. For graphs with known communities, our consensus partition captures the actual community structure more accurately than alternative approaches. To make it applicable to large graphs, we remove sequential dependencies from our algorithm and design a parallel algorithm. Our parallel algorithm achieves 35x speedup when utilizing 64 processing cores for large real-world graphs from single-cell experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved Visual Saliency of Graph Clusters with Orderable Node-Link Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are often used to model relationships between entities. The identification and visualization of clusters in graphs enable insight discovery in many application areas, such as life sciences and social sciences. Force-directed graph layouts promote the visual saliency of clusters, as they bring adjacent nodes closer together, and push non-adjacent nodes apart. At the same time, matrices can effectively show clusters when a suitable row/column ordering is applied, but are less appealing to untrained users not providing an intuitive node-link metaphor. It is thus worth exploring layouts combining the strengths of the node-link metaphor and node ordering. In this work, we study the impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable node-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc diagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can count clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with orderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed layout algorithms, i.e., `Linlog', `Backbone' and `sfdp'. The measured advantage is greater in case of low cluster separability and/or low compactness.

      <title>Dynamical importance and network perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the adjacency matrix of a graph exerts much influence on the behavior of dynamical processes on that graph. It is thus relevant to relate notions of the importance (specifically, centrality measures) of network structures to $\lambda$ and its associated eigenvector. We study a previously derived measure of edge importance known as ``dynamical importance'', which estimates how much $\lambda$ changes when one removes an edge from a graph or adds an edge to it. We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance. Through our analysis and computational experiments, we find that studying dynamical importance can improve understanding of the relationship between network perturbations and dynamical processes on networks.</description>

      <title>Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on the attention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist in leveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper link predictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. We will implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcase benchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Deep Learning for Forecasting Online Advertising Costs: Insights from the Competitive Bidding Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As advertisers increasingly shift their budgets toward digital advertising, accurately forecasting advertising costs becomes essential for optimizing marketing campaign returns. This paper presents a comprehensive study that employs various time-series forecasting methods to predict daily average CPC in the online advertising market. We evaluate the performance of statistical models, machine learning techniques, and deep learning approaches, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our findings reveal that incorporating multivariate models, enriched with covariates derived from competitors' CPC patterns through time-series clustering, significantly improves forecasting accuracy. We interpret the results by analyzing feature importance and temporal attention, demonstrating how the models leverage both the advertiser's data and insights from the competitive landscape. Additionally, our method proves robust during major market shifts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming models that rely solely on individual advertisers' data. This study introduces a scalable technique for selecting relevant covariates from a broad pool of advertisers, offering more accurate long-term forecasts and strategic insights into budget allocation and competitive dynamics in digital advertising.</description>

      <title>PathMLP: Smooth Path Towards High-order Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graphs exhibit increasing heterophily, where nodes no longer tend to be connected to nodes with the same label, challenging the homophily assumption of classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and impeding their performance. Intriguingly, from the observation of heterophilous data, we notice that certain high-order information exhibits higher homophily, which motivates us to involve high-order information in node representation learning. However, common practices in GNNs to acquire high-order information mainly through increasing model depth and altering message-passing mechanisms, which, albeit effective to a certain extent, suffer from three shortcomings: 1) over-smoothing due to excessive model depth and propagation times; 2) high-order information is not fully utilized; 3) low computational efficiency. In this regard, we design a similarity-based path sampling strategy to capture smooth paths containing high-order homophily. Then we propose a lightweight model based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), named PathMLP, which can encode messages carried by paths via simple transformation and concatenation operations, and effectively learn node representations in heterophilous graphs through adaptive path aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on 16 out of 20 datasets, underlining its effectiveness and superiority in alleviating the heterophily problem. In addition, our method is immune to over-smoothing and has high computational efficiency. The source code will be available in https://github.com/Graph4Sec-Team/PathMLP.</description>

      <title>GTFS2STN: Analyzing GTFS Transit Data by Generating Spatiotemporal Transit Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an open standard format for recording transit information, utilized by thousands of transit agencies worldwide. This study introduces GTFS2STN, a novel tool that converts static GTFS transit networks into spatiotemporal networks, connecting bus stops across space and time. This transformation enables comprehensive analysis of transit system accessibility. Additionally, we present a web-based application version of the GTFS2STN tool that allows users to generate spatiotemporal networks online and perform basic analyses, including the creation of isochrone maps from a given origin and the calculation of travel time variability between origin-destination pairs over time. Comparative analysis demonstrates that GTFS2STN produces results similar to those of Mapnificent, an existing open-source tool for generating isochrone maps from GTFS inputs. Compared with Mapnificent, GTFS2STN offers enhanced flexibility for researchers and planners to evaluate transit plans, as it allows users to upload and analyze historical or suggested GTFS feeds from any transit agency. This feature facilitates the assessment of accessibility and travel time variability in transit networks over extended periods, making GTFS2STN a valuable tool for the planning and research for the transit systems.</description>

      <title>What Drives Online Popularity: Author, Content or Sharers? Estimating Spread Dynamics with Bayesian Mixture Hawkes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of content on social media is shaped by intertwining factors on three levels: the source, the content itself, and the pathways of content spread. At the lowest level, the popularity of the sharing user determines its eventual reach. However, higher-level factors such as the nature of the online item and the credibility of its source also play crucial roles in determining how widely and rapidly the online item spreads. In this work, we propose the Bayesian Mixture Hawkes (BMH) model to jointly learn the influence of source, content and spread. We formulate the BMH model as a hierarchical mixture model of separable Hawkes processes, accommodating different classes of Hawkes dynamics and the influence of feature sets on these classes. We test the BMH model on two learning tasks, cold-start popularity prediction and temporal profile generalization performance, applying to two real-world retweet cascade datasets referencing articles from controversial and traditional media publishers. The BMH model outperforms the state-of-the-art models and predictive baselines on both datasets and utilizes cascade- and item-level information better than the alternatives. Lastly, we perform a counter-factual analysis where we apply the trained publisher-level BMH models to a set of article headlines and show that effectiveness of headline writing style (neutral, clickbait, inflammatory) varies across publishers. The BMH model unveils differences in style effectiveness between controversial and reputable publishers, where we find clickbait to be notably more effective for reputable publishers as opposed to controversial ones, which links to the latter's overuse of clickbait.</description>

      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>
