      <title>3DLNews: A Three-decade Dataset of US Local News Articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3DLNews, a novel dataset with local news articles from the United States spanning the period from 1996 to 2024. It contains almost 1 million URLs (with HTML text) from over 14,000 local newspapers, TV, and radio stations across all 50 states, and provides a broad snapshot of the US local news landscape. The dataset was collected by scraping Google and Twitter search results. We employed a multi-step filtering process to remove non-news article links and enriched the dataset with metadata such as the names and geo-coordinates of the source news media organizations, article publication dates, etc. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of 3DLNews by outlining four applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Relevance of Embedding-based Retrieval at Walmart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding-based neural retrieval (EBR) is an effective search retrieval method in product search for tackling the vocabulary gap between customer search queries and products. The initial launch of our EBR system at Walmart yielded significant gains in relevance and add-to-cart rates [1]. However, despite EBR generally retrieving more relevant products for reranking, we have observed numerous instances of relevance degradation. Enhancing retrieval performance is crucial, as it directly influences product reranking and affects the customer shopping experience. Factors contributing to these degradations include false positives/negatives in the training data and the inability to handle query misspellings. To address these issues, we present several approaches to further strengthen the capabilities of our EBR model in terms of retrieval relevance. We introduce a Relevance Reward Model (RRM) based on human relevance feedback. We utilize RRM to remove noise from the training data and distill it into our EBR model through a multi-objective loss. In addition, we present the techniques to increase the performance of our EBR model, such as typo-aware training, and semi-positive generation. The effectiveness of our EBR is demonstrated through offline relevance evaluation, online AB tests, and successful deployments to live production.

      <title>Relevance Filtering for Embedding-based Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In embedding-based retrieval, Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search enables efficient retrieval of similar items from large-scale datasets. While maximizing recall of relevant items is usually the goal of retrieval systems, a low precision may lead to a poor search experience. Unlike lexical retrieval, which inherently limits the size of the retrieved set through keyword matching, dense retrieval via ANN search has no natural cutoff. Moreover, the cosine similarity scores of embedding vectors are often optimized via contrastive or ranking losses, which make them difficult to interpret. Consequently, relying on top-K or cosine-similarity cutoff is often insufficient to filter out irrelevant results effectively. This issue is prominent in product search, where the number of relevant products is often small. This paper introduces a novel relevance filtering component (called "Cosine Adapter") for embedding-based retrieval to address this challenge. Our approach maps raw cosine similarity scores to interpretable scores using a query-dependent mapping function. We then apply a global threshold on the mapped scores to filter out irrelevant results. We are able to significantly increase the precision of the retrieved set, at the expense of a small loss of recall. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on both public MS MARCO dataset and internal Walmart product search data. Furthermore, online A/B testing on the Walmart site validates the practical value of our approach in real-world e-commerce settings.</description>

      <title>Early Exit Strategies for Approximate k-NN Search in Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned dense representations are a popular family of techniques for encoding queries and documents using high-dimensional embeddings, which enable retrieval by performing approximate k nearest-neighbors search (A-kNN). A popular technique for making A-kNN search efficient is based on a two-level index, where the embeddings of documents are clustered offline and, at query processing, a fixed number N of clusters closest to the query is visited exhaustively to compute the result set. In this paper, we build upon state-of-the-art for early exit A-kNN and propose an unsupervised method based on the notion of patience, which can reach competitive effectiveness with large efficiency gains. Moreover, we discuss a cascade approach where we first identify queries that find their nearest neighbor within the closest t &lt;&lt; N clusters, and then we decide how many more to visit based on our patience approach or other state-of-the-art strategies. Reproducible experiments employing state-of-the-art dense retrieval models and publicly available resources show that our techniques improve the A-kNN efficiency with up to 5x speedups while achieving negligible effectiveness losses.

      <title>A GNN Model with Adaptive Weights for Session-Based Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based recommendation systems aim to model users' interests based on their sequential interactions to predict the next item in an ongoing session. In this work, we present a novel approach that can be used in session-based recommendations (SBRs). Our goal is to enhance the prediction accuracy of an existing session-based recommendation model, the SR-GNN model, by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism applied to the graph neural network (GNN) vectors. This mechanism is designed to incorporate various types of side information obtained through different methods during the study. Items are assigned varying degrees of importance within each session as a result of the weighting mechanism. We hypothesize that this adaptive weighting strategy will contribute to more accurate predictions and thus improve the overall performance of SBRs in different scenarios. The adaptive weighting strategy can be utilized to address the cold start problem in SBRs by dynamically adjusting the importance of items in each session, thus providing better recommendations in cold start situations, such as for new users or newly added items. Our experimental evaluations on the Dressipi dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to traditional models in enhancing the user experience and highlighting its potential to optimize the recommendation results in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, large language models are gaining popularity, their achievements are used in many areas, ranging from text translation to generating answers to queries. However, the main problem with these new machine learning algorithms is that training such models requires large computing resources that only large IT companies have. To avoid this problem, a number of methods (LoRA, quantization) have been proposed so that existing models can be effectively fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose an E2E (end to end) audio summarization model using these techniques. In addition, this paper examines the effectiveness of these approaches to the problem under consideration and draws conclusions about the applicability of these methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PLUGH (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=plugh), a modern benchmark that currently consists of 5 tasks, each with 125 input texts extracted from 48 different games and representing 61 different (non-isomorphic) spatial graphs to assess the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for spatial understanding and reasoning. Our evaluation of API-based and open-sourced LLMs shows that while some commercial LLMs exhibit strong reasoning abilities, open-sourced competitors can demonstrate almost the same level of quality; however, all models still have significant room for improvement. We identify typical reasons for LLM failures and discuss possible ways to deal with them. Datasets and evaluation code are released (https://github.com/altsoph/PLUGH).</description>

      <title>Towards Semantic Markup of Mathematical Documents via User Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical documents written in LaTeX often contain ambiguities. We can resolve some of them via semantic markup using, e.g., sTeX, which also has other potential benefits, such as interoperability with computer algebra systems, proof systems, and increased accessibility. However, semantic markup is more involved than "regular" typesetting and presents a challenge for authors of mathematical documents. We aim to smooth out the transition from plain LaTeX to semantic markup by developing semi-automatic tools for authors. In this paper we present an approach to semantic markup of formulas by (semi-)automatically generating grammars from existing sTeX macro definitions and parsing mathematical formulas with them. We also present a GUI-based tool for the disambiguation of parse results and showcase its functionality and potential using a grammar for parsing untyped $\lambda$-terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist website states that the "checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible research, addressing issues of research ethics, societal impact and reproducibility." Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering the checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, the checklist is often filled out at the last moment. In this work, we introduce ACLReady, a retrieval-augmented language model application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with the ACL checklist. To test the effectiveness of the system, we conducted a qualitative study with 13 users which shows that 92% of users found the application useful and easy to use as well as 77% of the users found that the application provided the information they expected.

      <title>Hybrid Student-Teacher Large Language Model Refinement for Cancer Toxicity Symptom Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential for clinical symptom extraction, but their deployment in healthcare settings is constrained by privacy concerns, computational limitations, and operational costs. This study investigates the optimization of compact LLMs for cancer toxicity symptom extraction using a novel iterative refinement approach. We employ a student-teacher architecture, utilizing Zephyr-7b-beta and Phi3-mini-128 as student models and GPT-4o as the teacher, to dynamically select between prompt refinement, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies. Our experiments on 294 clinical notes covering 12 post-radiotherapy toxicity symptoms demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The RAG method proved most efficient, improving average accuracy scores from 0.32 to 0.73 for Zephyr-7b-beta and from 0.40 to 0.87 for Phi3-mini-128 during refinement. In the test set, both models showed an approximate 0.20 increase in accuracy across symptoms. Notably, this improvement was achieved at a cost 45 times lower than GPT-4o for Zephyr and 79 times lower for Phi-3. These results highlight the potential of iterative refinement techniques in enhancing the capabilities of compact LLMs for clinical applications, offering a balance between performance, cost-effectiveness, and privacy preservation in healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>MIDI-to-Tab: Guitar Tablature Inference via Masked Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guitar tablatures enrich the structure of traditional music notation by assigning each note to a string and fret of a guitar in a particular tuning, indicating precisely where to play the note on the instrument. The problem of generating tablature from a symbolic music representation involves inferring this string and fret assignment per note across an entire composition or performance. On the guitar, multiple string-fret assignments are possible for most pitches, which leads to a large combinatorial space that prevents exhaustive search approaches. Most modern methods use constraint-based dynamic programming to minimize some cost function (e.g.\ hand position movement). In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning solution to symbolic guitar tablature estimation. We train an encoder-decoder Transformer model in a masked language modeling paradigm to assign notes to strings. The model is first pre-trained on DadaGP, a dataset of over 25K tablatures, and then fine-tuned on a curated set of professionally transcribed guitar performances. Given the subjective nature of assessing tablature quality, we conduct a user study amongst guitarists, wherein we ask participants to rate the playability of multiple versions of tablature for the same four-bar excerpt. The results indicate our system significantly outperforms competing algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework enabling large language models (LLMs) to enhance their accuracy and reduce hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid RAG system enhanced through a comprehensive suite of optimizations that significantly improve retrieval quality, augment reasoning capabilities, and refine numerical computation ability. We refined the text chunks and tables in web pages, added attribute predictors to reduce hallucinations, conducted LLM Knowledge Extractor and Knowledge Graph Extractor, and finally built a reasoning strategy with all the references. We evaluated our system on the CRAG dataset through the Meta CRAG KDD Cup 2024 Competition. Both the local and online evaluations demonstrate that our system significantly enhances complex reasoning capabilities. In local evaluations, we have significantly improved accuracy and reduced error rates compared to the baseline model, achieving a notable increase in scores. In the meanwhile, we have attained outstanding results in online assessments, demonstrating the performance and generalization capabilities of the proposed system. The source code for our system is released in \url{https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/shizueyy/crag-new}.</description>

Abstract: In the evolving field of personalized news recommendation, understanding the semantics of the underlying data is crucial. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability in news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first framework for news recommendation that leverages the capabilities of LLMs through prompt engineering. This system incorporates a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process, enhancing the LLM-based recommender's ability to align news content with user preferences and interests more effectively. Moreover, this study offers insights into the effective use of LLMs in news recommendation, emphasizing both the advantages and the challenges of incorporating LLMs into recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Item Dissimilarities: Diversifying by Intent in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems that overly focus on short-term engagement prevents users from exploring diverse interests. To tackle this challenge, numerous diversification algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms typically rely on measures of item similarity, aiming to maximize the dissimilarity across items in the final set of recommendations. In this work, we demonstrate the benefits of going beyond item-level similarities by utilizing higher-level user understanding--specifically, user intents that persist across multiple interactions or recommendation sessions--in diversification. Our approach is motivated by the observation that user behaviors on online platforms are largely driven by their underlying intents. Therefore, final recommendations should ensure that a diverse set of intents is accurately represented. While user intent has primarily been studied in the context of search, it is less clear how to incorporate real-time dynamic intent predictions in recommender systems. To address this gap, we develop a probabilistic intent-based whole-page diversification framework for the final stage of a recommender system. Starting with a prior belief of user intents, the proposed framework sequentially selects items for each position based on these beliefs and subsequently updates posterior beliefs about the intents. This approach ensures that different user intents are represented on a page, towards optimizing long-term user experience.
  We experiment with the intent diversification framework on YouTube. Live experiments on a diverse set of intents show that our framework increases Daily Active Users and overall user enjoyment, validating its effectiveness in facilitating long-term planning. Specifically, it enables users to consistently discover and engage with diverse content that aligns with their underlying intents over time, leading to an improved long-term user experience.</description>

      <title>Refl-Spanners: A Purely Regular Approach to Non-Regular Core Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.13442v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regular spanners (characterised by vset-automata) are closed under the algebraic operations of union, join and projection, and have desirable algorithmic properties. The core spanners (introduced by Fagin, Kimelfeld, Reiss, and Vansummeren (PODS 2013, JACM 2015) as a formalisation of the core functionality of the query language AQL used in IBM's SystemT) additionally need string-equality selections and it has been shown by Freydenberger and Holldack (ICDT 2016, Theory of Computing Systems 2018) that this leads to high complexity and even undecidability of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation. We propose an alternative approach to core spanners: by incorporating the string-equality selections directly into the regular language that represents the underlying regular spanner (instead of treating it as an algebraic operation on the table extracted by the regular spanner), we obtain a fragment of core spanners that, while having slightly weaker expressive power than the full class of core spanners, arguably still covers the intuitive applications of string-equality selections for information extraction and has much better upper complexity bounds of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Graph classification is a critical task in numerous multimedia applications, where graphs are employed to represent diverse types of multimedia data, including images, videos, and social networks. Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, labeled graph data can be limited or scarce. To address this issue, we focus on the problem of semi-supervised graph classification, which involves both supervised and unsupervised models learning from labeled and unlabeled data. In contrast to recent approaches that transfer the entire knowledge from the unsupervised model to the supervised one, we argue that an effective transfer should only retain the relevant semantics that align well with the supervised task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named DisenSemi, which learns disentangled representation for semi-supervised graph classification. Specifically, a disentangled graph encoder is proposed to generate factor-wise graph representations for both supervised and unsupervised models. Then we train two models via supervised objective and mutual information (MI)-based constraints respectively. To ensure the meaningful transfer of knowledge from the unsupervised encoder to the supervised one, we further define an MI-based disentangled consistency regularization between two models and identify the corresponding rationale that aligns well with the current graph classification task. Experimental results on a range of publicly accessible datasets reveal the effectiveness of our DisenSemi.</description>
