      <title>Large Language Models as AI Agents for Digital Atoms and Molecules: Catalyzing a New Era in Computational Biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational biophysics, where molecular data is expanding rapidly and system complexity is increasing exponentially, large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems are fundamentally reshaping the field. This perspective article examines the recent advances at the intersection of LLMs, intelligent agents, and scientific computation, with a focus on biophysical computation. Building on these advancements, we introduce ADAM (Agent for Digital Atoms and Molecules), an innovative multi-agent LLM-based framework. ADAM employs cutting-edge AI architectures to reshape scientific workflows through a modular design. It adopts a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture that combines LLM-driven semantic tools with deterministic symbolic computations. Moreover, its ADAM Tool Protocol (ATP) enables asynchronous, database-centric tool orchestration, fostering community-driven extensibility. Despite the significant progress made, ongoing challenges call for further efforts in establishing benchmarking standards, optimizing foundational models and agents, and building an open collaborative ecosystem. ADAM is accessible at https://sidereus-ai.com.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>PYSED: A tool for extracting kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and lifetime from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy of thermal transport properties across diverse materials. However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights from these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED, a Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method, designed to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and extract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By integrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED method across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven MD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon nanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strength and twist angle in two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED method effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for metal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike propagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that phonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral trajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed phonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal transport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Interfacial Thermal Transport in van der Waals Heterostructures via Hybrid Machine Learning and Registry-Dependent Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit remarkable thermal anisotropy due to their strong intralayer covalent bonding and weak interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interactions. However, accurately modeling their thermal transport properties remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the computational limitations of density functional theory (DFT) and the inaccuracies of classical force fields in non-equilibrium regimes. To address this, we use a recently developed hybrid computational framework that combines machine learning potential (MLP) for intralayer interactions with registry-dependent interlayer potential (ILP) for anisotropic vdW interlayer interaction, achieving near quantum mechanical accuracy. This approach demonstrates exceptional agreement with DFT calculations and experimental data for TMD systems, accurately predicting key properties such as lattice constants, bulk modulus, moir\'e reconstruction, phonon spectra, and thermal conductivities. The scalability of this method enables accurate simulations of TMD heterostructures with large-scale moir\'e superlattices, making it a transformative tool for the design of TMD-based thermal metamaterials and devices, bridging the gap between accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</description>

      <title>A Practical Framework for Simulating Time-Resolved Spectroscopy Based on a Real-time Dyson Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing electron dynamics in molecules and solids, revealing transient phenomena on sub-femtosecond timescales. The interpretation of experimental results is often enhanced by parallel numerical studies, which can provide insight and validation for experimental hypotheses. However, developing a theoretical framework for simulating time-resolved spectra remains a significant challenge. The most suitable approach involves the many-body non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, which accounts for crucial dynamical many-body correlations during time evolution. While these dynamical correlations are essential for observing emergent behavior in time-resolved spectra, they also render the formalism prohibitively expensive for large-scale simulations. Substantial effort has been devoted to reducing this computational cost -- through approximations and numerical techniques -- while preserving the key dynamical correlations. The ultimate goal is to enable first-principles simulations of time-dependent systems ranging from small molecules to large, periodic, multidimensional solids. In this perspective, we outline key challenges in developing practical simulations for time-resolved spectroscopy, with a particular focus on Green's function methodologies. We highlight a recent advancement toward a scalable framework: the real-time Dyson expansion (RT-DE). We introduce the theoretical foundation of RT-DE and discuss strategies for improving scalability, which have already enabled simulations of system sizes beyond the reach of previous fully dynamical approaches. We conclude with an outlook on future directions for extending RT-DE to first-principles studies of dynamically correlated, non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>superB/NRPy: Scalable, Task-Based Numerical Relativity for 3G Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and computationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The Python-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR, including the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages curvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios. Historically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To address this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that enables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory Charm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the structured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its correctness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP version on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in cylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to $\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong scaling, achieving an $\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared to the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This scalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork for future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme parameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates with other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the general relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future coupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Automatic Design of Efficient Underwater Gliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals, utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean exploration and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Emergent Synaptic Plasticity from Tunable Dynamics of Probabilistic Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic (p-) computing, which leverages the stochasticity of its building blocks (p-bits) to solve a variety of computationally hard problems, has recently emerged as a promising physics-inspired hardware accelerator platform. A functionality of importance for p-computers is the ability to program-and reprogram-the interaction strength between arbitrary p-bits on-chip. In natural systems subject to random fluctuations, it is known that spatiotemporal noise can interact with the system's nonlinearities to render useful functionalities. Leveraging that principle, here we introduce a novel scheme for tunable coupling that inserts a ''hidden'' p-bit between each pair of computational p-bits. By modulating the fluctuation rate of the hidden p-bit relative to the synapse speed, we demonstrate both numerically and analytically that the effective interaction between the computational p-bits can be continuously tuned. Moreover, this tunability is directional, where the effective coupling from one computational p-bit to another can be made different from the reverse. This synaptic-plasticity mechanism could open new avenues for designing (re-)configurable p-computers and may inspire novel algorithms that leverage dynamic, hardware-level tuning of stochastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Tensile Behavior and Dislocation Dynamics in Cu and Ag Nanowires: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using molecular dynamics simulations, the research examine how copper and silver nanowires respond to tensile loading in order to clarify their nanoscale deformation mechanisms. The results demonstrate that these two metal nanowires follow notably different stress - strain trends, with silver wires exhibiting greater elastic stiffness and higher yield points at equivalent diameters - an effect likely rooted in silver's stronger atomic bonding and more stable microstructure. A pronounced size effect is observed: as the wire diameter diminishes, both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increase substantially, a behavior driven by the higher proportion of surface atoms that enhance dislocation nucleation and mobility. Atomistic analyses further underscore the dominant role of dislocations during plastic deformation, and in particular reveal that surface - initiated dislocations in thinner wires critically affect their fracture behavior.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Adjoint Method for Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and implement a second-order adjoint method to compute exact gradients and Hessians for a prototypical quantum optimal control problem, that of solving for the minimal energy applied electric field that drives a molecule from a given initial state to a desired target state. For small to moderately sized systems, we demonstrate a vectorized GPU implementation of a second-order adjoint method that computes both Hessians and gradients with wall times only marginally more than those required to compute gradients via commonly used first-order adjoint methods. Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a trust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a first-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to find optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the second-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The Colebrook-White equation is the widely used basis for the calculation of the friction factor lambda for flows in pipes and ducts. Because this equation is implicit in lambda, many solutions have been developed to ease the calculation in order to reduce the effort and to reach a sufficient accuracy. Clamond has proposed in 2008 an iterative solution that requires maximally two iterations to obtain the machine double precision. Here an improvement of this solution is presented, that achieves already with one iteration a maximal error of 2.79E-7, what is more than sufficient for most engineering purposes. This solution is compared in a chart of CPU time versus accuracy with 28 solutions from the literature and in the group of the fastest solutions, that require only two calls of the logarithm function, it proved to be by far the most accurate one.</description>
