      <title>Charge transport in organic semiconductors from the mapping approach to surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how to simulate charge diffusion in organic semiconductors using a recently introduced mixed quantum-classical method, the mapping approach to surface hopping. In contrast to standard fewest-switches surface hopping, this method propagates the classical degrees of freedom deterministically on the most populated adiabatic electronic state. This correctly preserves the equilibrium distribution of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons, allowing one to time-average along trajectories to improve the statistical convergence of the calculation. We illustrate the method with an application to a standard model for the charge transport in the direction of maximum mobility in crystalline rubrene. Because of its consistency with the quantum-classical equilibrium distribution, the present method gives a time-dependent diffusion coefficient that plateaus correctly to a long-time limiting value. We end by comparing our results for the mobility and optical conductivity to those of the widely used relaxation time approximation, which uses a phenomenological relaxation parameter to obtain a non-zero diffusion coefficient from a calculation with static phonon disorder. We find that this approximation generally underestimates the charge mobility when compared with our method, which is parameter free and directly simulates the thermal equilibrium diffusion of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons.</description>

      <title>Clearing the Air: Updated CS Fluorescence Efficiencies Don't Solve the NUV/Sub-mm Cometary CS Abundance Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Observations of carbon monosulfide (CS), a possible photodissociation fragment of CS$_2$, has a long history serving as a remote proxy for atomic sulfur, and more broadly, one of the sulfur reservoirs in cometary bodies. Interpretations of CS fluorescence emissions in ultraviolet observations of comets have, to-date, relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations for CS fluorescence efficiencies that can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to $v = 8$ and rotational states up to $N = 100$. A new set of band transition rates is produced through benchmarking comparisons to laboratory electron impact experiments, and subsequently utilized in the fluorescence calculations. We confirm historical reports of the ultraviolet $(0,0)$ band fluorescence efficiency, and conclude that blends and an expanded rovibrational structure have little impact on the fluorescence properties. Combined, the present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emissions in cometary observations with e.g., IUE and HST. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of comet Bradfield show favorable agreement with the theoretical models. We expand the model to the time-domain, and find that thermalization of the ground state and/or `hot' initial distributions of CS lead to noticable changes in the shape of the $(0,0)$ band. The impact on existing sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS observations, and new connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks are discussed. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic and Mechanical Properties of TPDH-Nanotube: Insights from Ab initio and Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19536</link>

Abstract: Tetra-Penta-Deca-Hexa-graphene (TPDH) is a new 2D carbon allotrope with attractive electronic and mechanical properties. It is composed of tetragonal, pentagonal, and hexagonal carbon rings. When TPDH-graphene is sliced into quasi-one-dimensional (1D) structures like nanoribbons, it exhibits a range of behaviors, from semi-metallic to semiconducting. An alternative approach to achieving these desirable electronic (electronic confinement and/or non-zero electronic band gap) properties is the creation of nanotubes (TPDH-NT). In the present work, we carried out a comprehensive study of TPDH-NTs combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Classical Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD). Our results show structural stability and a chiral dependence on mechanical properties. Similarly to standard carbon nanotubes, TPDH-NT can be metallic or semiconductor. MD results show Young's modulus values exceeding $700$ GPa, except for nanotubes with very small radii. However, certain chiral TPDH-NTs (n,m) display values both below and above $700$ GPa, particularly for those with small radii. The analyses of the angle and C-C bond length distributions underscore the significance of the tetragonal and pentagonal rings in determining the mechanical response of TPDH-NTs (n,0) and (0,n), respectively.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Correlation Augmented Self-Consistent Field Theory and Its Application to Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>
