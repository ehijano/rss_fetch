      <title>Exploring Citation Diversity in Scholarly Literature: An Entropy-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the citation diversity in scholarly literature, analyzing different patterns of citations observed within different countries and academic disciplines. We examine citation distributions across top institutions within certain countries and find that the higher end of the distribution follows a Power Law or Pareto Law pattern; the scaling exponent of the Pareto Law varies depending on the number of top institutions included in the analysis. By adopting a novel entropy-based diversity measure, our findings reveal that countries with both small and large economies tend to cluster similarly in terms of citation diversity. The composition of countries within each group changes as the number of top institutions considered in the analysis varies. Moreover, we analyze citation diversity among award-winning scientists across six scientific disciplines, finding significant variations. We also explore the evolution of citation diversity over the past century across multiple fields. A gender-based study in several disciplines confirms varying citation diversities among male and female scientists. Our innovative citation diversity measure stands out as a valuable tool for assessing the unevenness of citation distributions, providing deeper insights that go beyond what traditional citation counts alone can reveal. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of global scientific contributions and fosters a more equitable view of academic achievements.</description>

      <title>Semantic Information Management in Low-Temperature Plasma Science and Technology with VIVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital research data management is increasingly integrated across universities and research institutions, addressing the handling of research data throughout its lifecycle according to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Recent emphasis on the semantic and interlinking aspects of research data, e.g., by using ontologies and knowledge graphs further enhances findability and reusability. This work presents a framework for creating and maintaining a knowledge graph specifically for low-temperature plasma (LTP) science and technology. The framework leverages a domain-specific ontology called Plasma-O, along with the VIVO software as a platform for semantic information management in LTP research. While some research fields are already prepared to use ontologies and knowledge graphs for information management, their application in LTP research is nascent. This work aims to bridge this gap by providing a framework that not only improves research data management but also fosters community participation in building the domain-specific ontology and knowledge graph based on the published materials. The results may also support other research fields in the practical use of knowledge graphs for semantic information management.</description>
