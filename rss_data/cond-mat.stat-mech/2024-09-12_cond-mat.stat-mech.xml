      <title>Current fluctuations in the Dyson Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large fluctuations of the current in a Dyson gas, a 1D system of particles interacting through a logarithmic potential and subjected to random noise. We adapt the macroscopic fluctuation theory to the Dyson gas and derive two coupled partial differential equations describing the evolution of the density and momentum. These equations are nonlinear and non-local, and the `boundary' conditions are mixed: some at the initial time and others at the final time. If the initial condition can fluctuate (annealed setting), this boundary-value problem is tractable. We compute the cumulant generating function encoding all the cumulants of the current.</description>

      <title>Quasi-potential and drift decomposition in stochastic systems by sparse identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-potential is a key concept in stochastic systems as it accounts for the long-term behavior of the dynamics of such systems. It also allows us to estimate mean exit times from the attractors of the system, and transition rates between states. This is of significance in many applications across various areas such as physics, biology, ecology, and economy. Computation of the quasi-potential is often obtained via a functional minimization problem that can be challenging. This paper combines a sparse learning technique with action minimization methods in order to: (i) Identify the orthogonal decomposition of the deterministic vector field (drift) driving the stochastic dynamics; (ii) Determine the quasi-potential from this decomposition. This decomposition of the drift vector field into its gradient and orthogonal parts is accomplished with the help of a machine learning-based sparse identification technique. Specifically, the so-called sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) [1] is applied to the most likely trajectory in a stochastic system (instanton) to learn the orthogonal decomposition of the drift. Consequently, the quasi-potential can be evaluated even at points outside the instanton path, allowing our method to provide the complete quasi-potential landscape from this single trajectory. Additionally, the orthogonal drift component obtained within our framework is important as a correction to the exponential decay of transition rates and exit times. We implemented the proposed approach in 2- and 3-D systems, covering various types of potential landscapes and attractors.</description>

      <title>Active Brownian particle under stochastic position and orientation resetting in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) subject to both position and orientation stochastic resetting in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. Utilizing a Fokker-Planck-based renewal approach, we derive the system's exact moments, including the mean parallel displacement, mean squared displacement (MSD), and the fourth-order moment of displacement, and compare these with numerical simulations. To capture deviations from Gaussian behavior, we analyze the excess kurtosis, which reveals rich dynamical crossovers over time. These transitions span from Gaussian behavior (zero excess kurtosis) to two distinct non-Gaussian regimes: an activity-dominated regime (negative excess kurtosis) and a resetting-dominated regime (positive excess kurtosis). Furthermore, we quantify the steady-state phase diagrams by varying three key control parameters: activity, resetting rate, and harmonic trap strength, using steady-state excess kurtosis as the primary metric.</description>

      <title>Population Dynamics of Schr\"odinger Cats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an exact equivalence between classical population dynamics and Lindbladian evolution admitting a dark state and obeying a set of certain local symmetries. We then introduce {\em quantum population dynamics} as models in which this local symmetry condition is relaxed. This allows for non-classical processes in which animals behave like Schr\"odinger's cat and enter superpositions of live and dead states, thus resulting in coherent superpositions of different population numbers. We develop a field theory treatment of quantum population models as a synthesis of Keldysh and third quantization techniques and draw comparisons to the stochastic Doi-Peliti field theory description of classical population models. We apply this formalism to study a prototypical ``Schr\"odigner cat'' population model on a $d$-dimensional lattice, which exhibits a phase transition between a dark extinct phase and an active phase that supports a stable quantum population. Using a perturbative renormalization group approach, we find a critical scaling of the Schr\"odinger cat population distinct from that observed in both classical population dynamics and usual quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Flow is slow at the nanoscale: Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length all the way down to 1 nm. Our results also make clear that water flow under nano-confinement is orders of magnitude slower compared to the macroscopic case. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Dynamics as a Probe for Non-Hermitian Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Systems with Periodic Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Effects in Large Scale Intracellular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work probes the role of cell geometry in orienting self-organized fluid flows in the late stage Drosophila oocyte. Recent theoretical work has shown that a model, which relies only on hydrodynamic interactions of flexible, cortically anchored microtubules (MTs) and the mechanical loads from molecular motors moving upon them, is sufficient to generate observed flows. While the emergence of flows has been studied in spheres, oocytes change shape during streaming and it was unclear how robust these flows are to the geometry of the cell. Here we use biophysical theory and computational analysis to investigate the role of geometry and find that the axis of rotation is set by the shape of the domain and that the flow is robust to biologically relevant perturbations of the domain shape. Using live imaging and 3D flow reconstruction, we test the predictions of the theory/simulation, finding consistency between the model and live experiments, further demonstrating a geometric dependence on flow direction in late-stage Drosophila oocytes.</description>

      <title>Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits -- where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations -- are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state or, more generally, an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, in order to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit with finite recurrence time. With the aid of a suitable classical limit, we diagnose the control transition to be in a nonequilibrium universality class with dynamical exponent $z&lt;1$ that persists upon reintroducing quantum fluctuations. In the quantum limit, an entanglement transition additionally emerges that coincides with the control transition -- to within our numerical resolution. Both transitions exhibit a dynamical criticality consistent with recent results on measurement-induced phase transitions in power-law interacting circuits. We attribute this feature and the apparent coincidence of the control and entanglement transitions to the global nature of the control.</description>

      <title>Deviations from maximal entanglement for eigenstates of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider mid-spectrum eigenstates of the Sachdev-Ye-Kiteav (SYK) model. We prove that for subsystems whose size is a constant fraction of the system size, the entanglement entropy deviates from the maximum entropy by at least a positive constant. This result highlights the difference between the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of the SYK model and that of random states.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Quantum Many-body Scars with Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are rare eigenstates hidden within the chaotic spectra of many-body systems, representing a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Identifying these scars, as well as other non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, remains a significant challenge. Besides exact scar states, the nature of other non-thermal states lacking simple analytical characterization remains an open question. In this study, we employ tools from quantum machine learning -- specifically, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to explore hidden non-thermal states in chaotic many-body systems. Our simulations demonstrate that QCNNs achieve over 99% single-shot measurement accuracy in identifying all known scars. Furthermore, we successfully identify new non-thermal states in models such as the xorX model, the PXP model, and the far-coupling Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. In the xorX model, some of these non-thermal states can be approximately described as spin-wave modes of specific quasiparticles. We further develop effective tight-binding Hamiltonians within the quasiparticle subspace to capture key features of these many-body eigenstates. Finally, we validate the performance of QCNNs on IBM quantum devices, achieving single-shot measurement accuracy exceeding 63% under real-world noise and errors, with the aid of error mitigation techniques. Our results underscore the potential of QCNNs to uncover hidden non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Periodic potential can enormously boost free particle transport induced by active fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluctuations are detected in a growing number of systems due to self-propulsion mechanisms or collisions with active environment. They drive the system far from equilibrium and can induce phenomena which at equilibrium states are forbidden by e.g. fluctuation-dissipation relations and detailed balance symmetry. Understanding of their role in living matter is emerging as a challenge for physics. Here we demonstrate a paradoxical effect in which a free particle transport induced by active fluctuations can be boosted by many orders of magnitude when the particle is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. In contrast, within the realm of only thermal fluctuations the velocity of a free particle exposed to a bias is reduced when the periodic potential is switched on. The presented mechanism is significant for understanding nonequilibrium environments such as living cells where it can explain from a fundamental point of view why spatially periodic structures known as microtubules are necessary to generate impressively effective intracellular transport. Our findings can be readily corroborated experimentally e.g. in a setup comprising a colloidal particle in an optically generated periodic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For more than a century lattice random walks have been employed ubiquitously, both as a theoretical laboratory to develop intuition about more complex stochastic processes and as a tool to interpret a vast array of empirical observations. Recent advances in lattice random walk theory in bounded and heterogeneous environments have opened up opportunities to cope with the finely resolved spatio-temporal nature of modern movement data. We review such advances and their formalisms to represent analytically the walker spatio-temporal dynamics in arbitrary dimensions and geometries. As new findings, we derive the exact spatio-temporal representation of biased walks in a periodic hexagon, we use the discrete Feynman-Kac equation to describe a walker's interaction with a radiation boundary, and we unearth a disorder indifference phenomenon. To demonstrate the power of the formalism we uncover the appearance of multiple first-passage peaks with biased walkers in a periodic hexagon, we display the dependence of the first-transmission probability on the proximity transfer efficiency between two resetting walkers in a one-dimensional periodic lattice, we present an example of spatial disorder in a two-dimensional square lattice that strongly affects the splitting probabilities to either of two targets, and we study the first-reaction dynamics to a single lattice site in an unbounded one-dimensional lattice.</description>

Abstract: Discovering novel emergent behavior in quantum many-body systems is a main objective of contemporary research. In this paper, we explore the effects on phases and phase transitions of the proximity to a Ruelle-Fisher instability, marking the transition to a collapsed state. To accomplish this, we study by quantum Monte Carlo simulations a two-dimensional system of soft-core bosons interacting through an isotropic finite-ranged attraction, with a parameter $\eta$ describing its strength. If $\eta$ exceeds a characteristic value $\eta_c$, the thermodynamic limit is lost, as the system becomes unstable against collapse. We investigate the phase diagram of the model for $\eta\lesssim\eta_c$, finding -- in addition to a liquid-vapor transition -- a first-order transition between two liquid phases. Upon cooling, the high-density liquid turns superfluid, possibly above the vapor-liquid-liquid triple temperature. As $\eta$ approaches $\eta_c$, the stability region of the high-density liquid is shifted to increasingly higher densities, a behavior at variance with distinguishable quantum or classical particles. Finally, for $\eta$ larger than $\eta_c$ our simulations yield evidence of collapse of the low-temperature fluid for any density; the collapsed system forms a circular cluster whose radius is insensitive to the number of particles.</description>

      <title>Semi-infinite simple exclusion process: from current fluctuations to target survival</title>

Abstract: The symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP), where diffusive particles cannot overtake each other, is a paradigmatic model of transport in the single-file geometry. In this model, the study of currents has attracted a lot of attention, but so far most results are restricted to two geometries: (i) a finite system between two reservoirs, which does not conserve the number of particles but reaches a nonequilibrium steady state, and (ii) an infinite system which conserves the number of particles but never reaches a steady state. Here, we determine the full cumulant generating function of the integrated current in the important intermediate situation of a semi-infinite system connected to a reservoir, which does not conserve the number of particles and never reaches a steady state. This result is obtained thanks to the determination of the full spatial structure of the correlations which remarkably obey the very same closed equation recently obtained in the infinite geometry. Besides their intrinsic interest, these results allow us to solve two open problems: the survival probability of a fixed target in the SEP, and the statistics of the number of particles injected by a localized source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform network analysis of a system described by the master equation to estimate the lower bound of the steady-state current noise, starting from the level 2.5 large deviation function and using the graph theory approach. When the transition rates are uniform, and the system is driven to a non-equilibrium steady state by unidirectional transitions, we derive a noise lower bound, which accounts for fluctuations of sojourn times at all states and is expressed using mesh currents. This bound is applied to the uncertainty in the signal-to-noise ratio of the fluctuating computation time of a schematic Brownian computation plus reset process described by a graph containing one cycle. Unlike the mixed and pseudo-entropy bounds that increase logarithmically with the length of the intended computation path, this bound depends on the number of extraneous predecessors and thus captures the logical irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of adiabatic quantum pumping in quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a self-contained thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimer tiling problem asks in how many ways can the edges of a graph be covered by dimers so that each site is covered once. In the special case of a planar graph, this problem has a solution in terms of a free fermionic field theory. We rediscover and explore an expression for the number of coverings of an arbitrary graph by arbitrary objects in terms of an interacting fermionic field theory first proposed by Samuel. Generalizations of the dimer tiling problem, which we call `dimer piling problems,' demand that each site be covered N times by indistinguishable dimers. Our field theory provides a solution of these problems in the large-N limit. We give a similar path integral representation for certain lattice coloring problems.</description>

      <title>Projected state ensemble of a generic model of many-body quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projected ensemble is based on the study of the quantum state of a subsystem $A$ conditioned on projective measurements in its complement. Recent studies have observed that a more refined measure of the thermalization of a chaotic quantum system can be defined on the basis of convergence of the projected ensemble to a quantum state design, i.e. a system thermalizes when it becomes indistinguishable, up to the $k$-th moment, from a Haar ensemble of uniformly distributed pure states. Here we consider a random unitary circuit with the brick-wall geometry and analyze its convergence to the Haar ensemble through the frame potential and its mapping to a statistical mechanical problem. This approach allows us to highlight a geometric interpretation of the frame potential based on the existence of a fluctuating membrane, similar to those appearing in the study of entanglement entropies. At large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we find that all moments converge simultaneously with a time scaling linearly in the size of region $A$, a feature previously observed in dual unitary models. However, based on the geometric interpretation, we argue that the scaling at finite $q$ on the basis of rare membrane fluctuations, finding the logarithmic scaling of design times $t_k = O(\log k)$. Our results are supported with numerical simulations performed at $q=2$.</description>

      <title>Phonons in stringlet-land and the boson peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid materials that deviate from the harmonic crystal paradigm exhibit characteristic anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states (VDOS) with respect to Debye's theory predictions. The boson peak (BP), a low-frequency excess in the VDOS over Debye law $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is certainly the most famous among them; nevertheless, its origin is still subject of fierce debate. Recent simulation works provided strong evidence that localized one-dimensional string-like excitations (stringlets) might be the microscopic origin of the BP. In this work, we study the dynamics of acoustic phonons interacting with a bath of vibrating 1D stringlets with exponentially distributed size, as observed in simulations. We show that stringlets strongly renormalize the phonon propagator and naturally induce a BP anomaly in the vibrational density of states, corresponding to the emergence of a dispersionless BP flat mode. Additionally, phonon-stringlet interactions produce a strong enhancement of sound attenuation and a dip in the speed of sound near the BP frequency, consistent with experimental and simulation data. The qualitative trends of the BP frequency and intensity are predicted within the model and shown to be in good agreement with previous observations. In summary, our results substantiate with a simple theoretical model the recent simulation results by Hu and Tanaka claiming the origin of the BP from stringlet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian way for the relaxation time approximation, application to Kibble-Zurek processes due to environment temperature quench, and to Lindbladian perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, a global Lindbladian ansatz is constructed which leads to thermalization at temperature $T$ to the Gibs state of the investigated system. This ansatz connects every two eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and leads to a simple master equation known in the literature as the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The main message of this paper is that RTA, being a Lindbladian approach itself, can be used as Lindbladian securing thermalization when modeling physical processes, and can be consequently combined with other types of Lindbladians which would drive the system of the equilibrium state. I demonstrate it with two applications. The first application is the slow cooling (or heating) of quantum systems by varying the environment temperature to a critical point. With this RTA-Lindblad ansatz, one can directly relate to the equilibrium behavior of the system, and if an order parameter has the exponent $\Psi$, the remaining value at the phase transition will decrease with $1/\tau^{\Psi}$, where $\tau$ is the overall time of the slow process. In the second application, I investigate the change in the expectation value of a conserved quantity (an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian) due to an extra Lindbladian term which would drive the system out from equilibrium, while the thermalizing RTA-Lindbladian term is also present. I give a closed perturbative expression in the first order for the expectation value in the new steady state using only expectation values calculated in the original thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Math behind everyday life: "black days", their manifestation as traffic jams, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our daily lives, we encounter numerous independent events, each occurring with varying probabilities over time. This letter delves into the scientific background behind the inhomogeneous distribution of these events over time, often resulting in what we refer to as ``black days'', where multiple events seem to converge at once. In the first part of the work we performed an analysis involving $D$ independent periodic and random sequences of events. Using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, we observed a clustering of event sequences on a two-dimensional manifold ${\cal M}$ at a certain large $D$. We interpret this clustering as a signature of ``black days'', which bears a clear resemblance to traffic jams in vehicle flow. In the second part of the work we examined in detail clustering patterns of independently distributed $N$ points within the corners of a $D$-dimensional cube when $1\ll N&lt;D$. Our findings revealed that a transition to a single-component cluster occurs at a critical dimensionality, $D_{cr}$, via a nearly third-order phase transition. Analyzing the spectral density, $\rho(\lambda)$, of the corresponding adjacency graph in the vicinity of the clustering transition we recover the singular ''Lifshitz tail'' behavior at the spectral boundary of $\rho(\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the algebra of Parisi ultrametric matrices is recovered by the real-time, replica-free, Dyson-Keldysh equations of infinite-range quantum spin glasses in the late time glassy limit. This connects to earlier results on classical and quantum systems showing how ultrametricity emerges from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. The stationary spin glass state thereby spontaneously breaks thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We describe the Keldysh path integral of the infinite-range Ising model in transverse and longitudinal fields, and in the context of the Landau expansion of the action functional, show how the long-time limit connects to the full replica symmetry breaking obtained in the equilibrium formalism. We also illustrate our formalism by applying it to the spherical quantum $p$-spin model, which only exhibits one-step replica symmetry breaking</description>

      <title>Localized RG flows on composite defects and $\mathcal{C}$-theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body lattice systems via spectra of momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions due to an almost conserved operator. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Emergent Massive Nambu-Goldstone Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the roughening of interfaces in phase-separated active suspensions on substrates. At large length and timescales, we show that the interfacial dynamics belongs to the |q|KPZ universality class discussed in Besse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187102 (2023). This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, instead, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</description>
