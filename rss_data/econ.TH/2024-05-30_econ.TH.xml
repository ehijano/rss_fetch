      <title>New Approaches to Old Problems? Thinking About a New Design of the AML/CFT Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entry of new technological infrastructures into the financial markets poses serious concerns about the misuse of the economic system for illicit purposes, such as money laundering and financing of terrorism. Although there are cases in which this connection has already been discovered by malicious actors, distributed ledger technologies can nevertheless represent a powerful tool at the disposal of competent authorities to trace illicit flows and to better monitor risks in financial markets. However, this possibility may go through an interdisciplinary analysis of the phenomena. The search for alternative systems to move funds, rather than the traditional financial intermediaries, such as banks, is not a new circumstance and not necessarily for criminal purposes. Nevertheless, some of the already-known value transfer systems may benefit from the use of distributed ledger technology and make their detection more difficult. The European institutions are discussing the needed legislative packages to enforce the current regulations and to extend their application to the crypto space, as well as the establishment of a new competent authority.</description>

      <title>Falsifiable Test Design in Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal can propose a project to an agent, who then decides whether to accept. Their payoffs from launching the project depend on an unknown binary state. The principal can obtain more precise information about the state through a test at no cost, but crucially, it is common knowledge that she can falsify the test result. In the most interesting case where players have conflicted interests, the optimal test is a binary lemon-detecting test. We also find that coordination is possible when the principal is pessimistic but not when the agent is pessimistic. Moreover, when the agent has private information about the state, a single binary lemon-detecting test remains optimal even though the principal has the option to screen the agent by providing a menu of tests. Our finding is consistent with observed tests in real practice.</description>

      <title>Rationalizing Path-Independent Choice Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path independence is arguably one of the most important choice rule properties in economic theory. We show that a choice rule is path independent if and only if it is rationalizable by a utility function satisfying ordinal concavity, a concept closely related to concavity notions in discrete mathematics. We also provide a rationalization result for choice rules that satisfy path independence and the law of aggregate demand.</description>

      <title>Why Transaction Cost Economics Failed and How to Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connotation of transaction costs has never been definitively determined, and the independence of the concept has never been rigorously demonstrated. This paper delves into the thought systems of several prominent economists in the development of transaction cost economics, starting from first-hand materials. By combining multiple works of the authors, it reconstructs the true meanings and identifies endogeneity issues and logical inconsistencies. The conclusion of this paper is bold. Previous research has been largely filled with misinterpretations and misunderstandings, as people have focused solely on the wording of transaction cost definitions, neglecting the nature of transaction costs. The intention of transaction cost theory has been unwittingly assimilated into the objects it intends to criticize. After delineating the framework of "transaction costs-property rights-competition", this paper reconstructs the concept of transaction costs and the history of transaction cost concepts, providing a direct response to this theoretical puzzle that has plagued the academic community for nearly a century.</description>
