      <title>Simulating optically-active spin defects with a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a pressing need for more accurate computational simulations of the opto-electronic properties of defects in materials to aid in the development of quantum sensing platforms. In this work, we explore how quantum computers could be effectively utilized for this purpose. Specifically, we develop fault-tolerant quantum algorithms to simulate optically active defect states and their radiative emission rates. We employ quantum defect embedding theory to translate the Hamiltonian of a defect-containing supercell into a smaller, effective Hamiltonian that accounts for dielectric screening effects. Our approach integrates block-encoding of the dipole operator with quantum phase estimation to selectively sample the optically active excited states that exhibit the largest dipole transition amplitudes. We also provide estimates of the quantum resources required to simulate a negatively-charged boron vacancy in a hexagonal boron nitride cluster. We conclude by offering a forward-looking perspective on the potential of quantum computers to enhance quantum sensor capabilities and identify specific scenarios where quantum computing can resolve problems traditionally challenging for classical computers.</description>

      <title>Practical and efficient quantum circuit synthesis and transpiling with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into quantum transpiling workflows, significantly enhancing the synthesis and routing of quantum circuits. By employing RL, we achieve near-optimal synthesis of Linear Function, Clifford, and Permutation circuits, up to 9, 11 and 65 qubits respectively, while being compatible with native device instruction sets and connectivity constraints, and orders of magnitude faster than optimization methods such as SAT solvers. We also achieve significant reductions in two-qubit gate depth and count for circuit routing up to 133 qubits with respect to other routing heuristics such as SABRE. We find the method to be efficient enough to be useful in practice in typical quantum transpiling pipelines. Our results set the stage for further AI-powered enhancements of quantum computing workflows.</description>

      <title>Quantum Software Ecosystem Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing necessitate a scientific and rigorous approach to the construction of a corresponding software ecosystem, a topic underexplored and primed for systematic investigation. This chapter takes an important step in this direction: It presents scientific considerations essential for building a quantum software ecosystem that makes quantum computing available for scientific and industrial problem solving. Central to this discourse is the concept of hardware-software co-design, which fosters a bidirectional feedback loop from the application layer at the top of the software stack down to the hardware. This approach begins with compilers and low-level software that are specifically designed to align with the unique specifications and constraints of the quantum processor, proceeds with algorithms developed with a clear understanding of underlying hardware and computational model features, and extends to applications that effectively leverage the capabilities to achieve a quantum advantage. We analyze the ecosystem from two critical perspectives: the conceptual view, focusing on theoretical foundations, and the technical infrastructure, addressing practical implementations around real quantum devices necessary for a functional ecosystem. This approach ensures that the focus is towards promising applications with optimized algorithm-circuit synergy, while ensuring a user-friendly design, an effective data management and an overall orchestration. Our chapter thus offers a guide to the essential concepts and practical strategies necessary for developing a scientifically grounded quantum software ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Heralded arbitrary graph states with inefficient quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitter-based schemes for the generation of photonic graph states offer a promising, resource efficient methodology for realizing distributed quantum computation and communication protocols on near-term hardware. We present a heralded scheme for making photonic graph states that is compatible with the typically poor photon collection from state-of-the-art coherent quantum emitters. We demonstrate that the construction time for large graph states can be polynomial in the photon collection efficiency, as compared to the exponential scaling of current emitter-based schemes, which assume deterministic photon collection. The additional overhead to achieve this advantage consists of an extra spin system plus one additional spin-spin entangling gate per photon added to the graph. While the proposed scheme enables the generation of graph states for arbitrary applications, we show how it can be further simplified for the specific task of measurement-based computation, leading to significantly higher rates and removing the need for photonic memory in certain computations. As an example use-case of our scheme, we construct a protocol for secure two-party computation that can be implemented efficiently on current hardware. Estimates of the fidelity to produce graph states used in the computation are given, based on current trapped ion experimental benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Homodyne detection is optimal for quantum interferometry with path-entangled coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurement schemes that do not rely on photon-number resolving detectors, but that are nevertheless optimal for estimating a differential phase shift in interferometry with either an entangled coherent state or a qubit-which-path state (where the path taken by a coherent-state wavepacket is entangled with the state of a qubit). The homodyning schemes analyzed here achieve optimality (saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound) by maximizing the sensitivity of measurement outcomes to phase-dependent interference fringes in a reduced Wigner distribution. In the presence of photon loss, the schemes become suboptimal, but we find that their performance is independent of the phase to be measured. They can therefore be implemented without any prior information about the phase and without adapting the strategy during measurement, unlike strategies based on photon-number parity measurements or direct photon counting.</description>

      <title>Dequantizability from inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By comparing constructions of block encoding given by [1-4], we propose a way to extract dequantizability from advancements in dequantization techniques that have been led by Tang, as in [5]. Then we apply this notion to the sparse-access input model that is known to be BQP-complete in general, thereby conceived to be un-dequantizable. Our goal is to break down this belief by examining the sparse-access input model's instances, particularly their input matrices. In conclusion, this paper forms a dequantizability-verifying scheme that can be applied whenever an input is given.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality of generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} models with exact mobility edges using fidelity susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the quantum critical phenomena in generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} models, with a particular focus on the scaling behavior at various filling states. Our approach involves using quantum fidelity susceptibility to precisely identify the mobility edges in these systems. Through a finite-size scaling analysis of the fidelity susceptibility, we are able to determine both the correlation-length critical exponent and the dynamical critical exponent at the critical point of the generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} model. Based on the Diophantine equation conjecture, we can determines the number of subsequences of the Fibonacci sequence and the corresponding scaling functions for a specific filling fraction, as well as the universality class. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of employing the generalized fidelity susceptibility for the analysis of unconventional quantum criticality and the associated universal information of quasiperiodic systems in cutting-edge quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum (Inspired) $D^2$-sampling with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $D^2$-sampling is a fundamental component of sampling-based clustering algorithms such as $k$-means++. Given a dataset $V \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $N$ points and a center set $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $D^2$-sampling refers to picking a point from $V$ where the sampling probability of a point is proportional to its squared distance from the nearest center in $C$. Starting with empty $C$ and iteratively $D^2$-sampling and updating $C$ in $k$ rounds is precisely $k$-means++ seeding that runs in $O(Nkd)$ time and gives $O(\log{k})$-approximation in expectation for the $k$-means problem. We give a quantum algorithm for (approximate) $D^2$-sampling in the QRAM model that results in a quantum implementation of $k$-means++ that runs in time $\tilde{O}(\zeta^2 k^2)$. Here $\zeta$ is the aspect ratio (i.e., largest to smallest interpoint distance), and $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $N, d, k$. It can be shown through a robust approximation analysis of $k$-means++ that the quantum version preserves its $O(\log{k})$ approximation guarantee. Further, we show that our quantum algorithm for $D^2$-sampling can be 'dequantized' using the sample-query access model of Tang (PhD Thesis, Ewin Tang, University of Washington, 2023). This results in a fast quantum-inspired classical implementation of $k$-means++, which we call QI-$k$-means++, with a running time $O(Nd) + \tilde{O}(\zeta^2k^2d)$, where the $O(Nd)$ term is for setting up the sample-query access data structure. Experimental investigations show promising results for QI-$k$-means++ on large datasets with bounded aspect ratio. Finally, we use our quantum $D^2$-sampling with the known $ D^2$-sampling-based classical approximation scheme (i.e., $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for any given $\varepsilon&gt;0$) to obtain the first quantum approximation scheme for the $k$-means problem with polylogarithmic running time dependence on $N$.</description>

      <title>Realization of a crosstalk-free multi-ion node for long-distance quantum networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions constitute one of the leading physical platforms for building the quantum repeater nodes to realize large-scale quantum networks. In a long-distance trapped-ion quantum network, it is essential to have crosstalk-free dual-type qubits: one type, called the communication qubit, to establish entangling interface with telecom photons; and the other type, called the memory qubit, to store quantum information immune from photon scattering under entangling attempts. Here, we report the first experimental implementation of a telecom-compatible and crosstalk-free quantum network node based on two trapped $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ ions. The memory qubit is encoded on a long-lived metastable level to avoid crosstalk with the communication qubit encoded in another subspace of the same ion species, and a quantum wavelength conversion module is employed to generate ion-photon entanglement over a $12\,$km fiber in a heralded style. Our work therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of quantum repeaters and long-distance quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Unitary Quantum Algorithm for the Lattice-Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for computational fluid dynamics based on the Lattice-Boltzmann method. Our approach involves a novel encoding strategy and a modified collision operator, assuming full relaxation to the local equilibrium within a single time step. Our quantum algorithm enables the computation of multiple time steps in the linearized case, specifically for solving the advection-diffusion equation, before necessitating a full state measurement. Moreover, our formulation can be extended to compute the non-linear equilibrium distribution function for a single time step prior to measurement, utilizing the measurement as an essential algorithmic step. However, in the non-linear case, a classical postprocessing step is necessary for computing the moments of the distribution function. We validate our algorithm by solving the one dimensional advection-diffusion of a Gaussian hill. Our results demonstrate that our quantum algorithm captures non-linearity.</description>

      <title>Sudden change of genuine multipartite entanglement in non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement dynamics of bipartite as well multipartite systems beyond Markov approximation. We study two pairs of cavity-reservoir systems, modeled as four qubits and track the change of entanglement among cavity-cavity qubits, reservoir-reservoir qubits, and also for genuine entanglement of all four qubits. For cavity-cavity qubits, we find that non-Markovianity prolongs the life of entanglement besides collapse/revival phenomenon. For reservoir-reservoir qubits, entanglement sudden birth is delayed accordingly along with oscillations. For all four qubits, with a specific initial state, we find that genuine entanglement develops gradually, reaches to a maximum constant value and then freezes at this value for some time before decaying. This sudden change in dynamics of genuine entanglement occurs for a time window where neither cavities nor reservoirs are entangled. In contrast to Markov process, sudden change phenomenon may be recurrent in non-Markovian regime.</description>

      <title>Detection of entanglement via moments of positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have reexamined the moments of positive maps and the criterion based on these moments to detect entanglement. For two qubits, we observed that reduction map is equivalent to partial transpose map as the resulting matrices have the same set of eigenvalues although both matrices look different in same computational basis. Consequently, the detection power of both maps is same. For $2 \otimes 4$ systems, we find that moments of reduction map are capable to detect a family of bound entangled states. For qutrit-qutrit systems, we show that moments of reduction map can detect two well known families of bound entangled states. The moments of another positive map can detect the complete range of entanglement for a specific family of quantum states, whereas the earlier criterion fails to detect a small range of entangled states. For three qubits system, we find that applying reduction map to one of the qubit is equivalent to partial transpose operation. In particularly, for GHZ state and W state mixed with white noise, all the moments of a reduction map are exactly the same as the moments of partial transpose map.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Non-perturbative Regime of the Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator by Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of deep learning in physical sciences has recently boosted the ability of researchers to tackle physical systems where little or no analytical insight is available. Recently, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been introduced as one of the most promising tools to solve systems of differential equations guided by some physically grounded constraints. In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator. We investigate systems with real and imaginary frequency, laying the foundation for novel numerical methods to tackle problems emerging in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Quantum Depthwise Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the development of quantum machine learning, quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained increasing attention in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and have achieved a series of promising results. However, most existing QNN models focus on the architectures of quantum recurrent neural network (QRNN) and self-attention mechanism (QSAM). In this work, we propose a novel QNN model based on quantum convolution. We develop the quantum depthwise convolution that significantly reduces the number of parameters and lowers computational complexity. We also introduce the multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to enhance model performance by integrating word-level and sentence-level features. Additionally, we propose the quantum word embedding and quantum sentence embedding, which provide embedding vectors more efficiently. Through experiments on two benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate our model outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art QNN models. Notably, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art test accuracy of 96.77% on the RP dataset. We also show the advantages of our quantum model over its classical counterparts in its ability to improve test accuracy using fewer parameters. Finally, an ablation test confirms the effectiveness of the multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and quantum depthwise convolution in enhancing model performance.</description>

      <title>Dual-Capability Machine Learning Models for Quantum Hamiltonian Parameter Estimation and Dynamics Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum hardware and classical computing simulations have significantly enhanced the accessibility of quantum system data, leading to an increased demand for precise descriptions and predictions of these systems. Accurate prediction of quantum Hamiltonian dynamics and identification of Hamiltonian parameters are crucial for advancements in quantum simulations, error correction, and control protocols. This study introduces a machine learning model with dual capabilities: it can deduce time-dependent Hamiltonian parameters from observed changes in local observables within quantum many-body systems, and it can predict the evolution of these observables based on Hamiltonian parameters. Our model's validity was confirmed through theoretical simulations across various scenarios and further validated by two experiments. Initially, the model was applied to a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum computer, where it accurately predicted the dynamics of local observables. The model was then tested on a superconducting quantum computer with initially unknown Hamiltonian parameters, successfully inferring them. Our approach aims to enhance various quantum computing tasks, including parameter estimation, noise characterization, feedback processes, and quantum control optimization.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation in Zeno subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Zeno effect as a framework for designing and analyzing quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation. We show that frequent projective measurements of an ancilla qubit register can be used to simulate quantum dynamics on a target qubit register with a circuit complexity similar to randomized approaches. The classical sampling overhead in the latter approaches is traded for ancilla qubit overhead in Zeno-based approaches. A second-order Zeno sequence is developed to improve scaling and implementations through unitary kicks are discussed. We show that the circuits over the combined register can be identified as a subroutine commonly used in post-Trotter Hamiltonian simulation methods. We build on this observation to reveal connections between different Hamiltonian simulation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Classical Simulation of Quantum Circuits of Clifford Gates through Simple Examples and Intuitive Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that quantum circuits composed solely of Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated classically. This theorem hinges on the fact that Clifford gates map Pauli strings to other Pauli strings, thereby allowing for a structured simulation process using classical computations. In this explanation, we break down the step-by-step procedure of the Gottesman-Knill theorem in a beginner-friendly manner, leveraging concepts such as matrix products, tensor products, commutation, anti-commutation, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of quantum mechanical operators. Through detailed examples illustrating superposition and entanglement phenomena, we aim to provide a clear understanding of the classical simulation of Clifford gate-based quantum circuits. While we do not provide a formal proof of the theorem, we offer intuitive physical insights at each stage where necessary, empowering readers to grasp the fundamental principles underpinning this intriguing aspect of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-fluctuation asymmetry in multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the statistical behavior of the light emanating from a coherently driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) oscillator operating in the regime of multiphoton blockade with two monitored output channels causing the loss of coherence at equal rates. We do so by adopting an operational approach which draws the particle and wave aspects of the forwards scattered radiation together, building upon the relationship between quantum optical correlation functions and conditional measurements. We first derive an analytical expression of the intensity cross-correlation function at the peak of the two-photon JC resonance to demonstrate the breakdown of detailed balance. The application of quantum trajectory theory in parallel with the quantum regression formula subsequently uncovers various aspects of temporal asymmetry in the quantum fluctuations characterizing the cascaded process through which a multiphoton resonance is established and read out. We find that monitoring different quadratures of the cavity field in conditional homodyne detection affects the times waited between successive photon counter ``clicks'', which in turn trigger the sampling of the homodyne current. Despite the fact that the steady-state cavity occupation is of the order of a photon, monitoring of the developing bimodality also impacts on the ratio between the emissions directed along the two decoherence channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise quantum circuit implementation of exponential of scaled $n$-qubit Pauli-strings using one-qubit rotation gates and CNOT gates. These circuits can be implemented in low-connected quantum hardware, in particular, star graph architecture for digital quantum computation. Then these circuits are employed to simulate classes of 1D Hamiltonian operators that include $2$-sparse Hamiltonian, Ising Hamiltonian, and both time-independent and time-dependent Random Field Heisenberg Hamiltonian and Transverse Magnetic Random Quantum Ising Hamiltonian by approximating its unitary evolution with first-order Suzuki-Trotter expansion. Finally, we perform noisy Hamiltonian simulation of these circuits using different noise models to investigate Hamiltonian simulation on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Superradiant Phase Transitions and Multicriticality in a Cavity QED System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of nonreciprocal superradiant phase transitions and novel multicriticality in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, where a two-level atom interacts with two counter-propagating modes of a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microcavity. The cavity rotates at a certain angular velocity, and is directionally squeezed by a unidirectional parametric pumping $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. The combination of cavity rotation and directional squeezing leads to nonreciprocal first- and second-order superradiant phase transitions. These transitions do not require ultrastrong atom-field couplings and can be easily controlled by the external pump field. Through a full quantum description of the system Hamiltonian, we identify two types of multicritical points in the phase diagram, both of which exhibit controllable nonreciprocity. These results open a new door for all-optical manipulation of superradiant transitions and multicritical behaviors in light-matter systems, with potential applications in engineering various integrated nonreciprocal quantum devices</description>

      <title>Coherent feedback control for cavity optomechanical systems with a frequency-dependent mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-state cooling of mechanical resonators is a prerequisite for the observation of various quantum effects in optomechanical systems and thus has always been a crucial task in quantum optomechanics. In this paper, we study how to realize ground-state cooling of the mechanical mode in a Fano-mirror optomechanical setup, which allows for enhanced effective optomechanical interaction but typically works in the (deeply) unresolved-sideband regime. We reveal that for such a two-sided cavity geometry with very different decay rates at the two cavity mirrors when using an appropriate single-sided coherent feedback, it is possible to cool the mechanical mode down to its ground state within a broad range of parameters. This is possible even if the total optical loss is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical frequency and the feedback efficiency is relatively low. Importantly, we show that a more standard two-sided feedback scheme is not appropriate to cooperate with a Fano-mirror system.</description>

      <title>Formation and Dissociation of Field-Linked Tetramers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static and dynamic properties of tetratomic molecules formed by two microwave-shielded polar molecules across field-linked resonances. In particular, we focus on two-body physics and experimental techniques unexplored in the recent experiment [X.-Y. Chen {\it et al}., Nature {\bf626}, 283 (2024)]. We show that, compared to the lowest tetramer state, higher tetramer states typically have longer lifetimes, which may facilitate a further cooling of tetramer gases towards quantum degeneracy. To detect tetramers, we identify the distinctive time-of-flight images from ramp dissociation, which can be observed by lowering the ramp rate of the microwave. Remarkably, in the modulational dissociation of tetramers, we find that multi-photon processes induce dissociation even below the threshold modulation frequency when the modulation amplitude is sufficiently high. Given the universal form of the inter-molecular potential for microwave-shielded polar molecules, our results also apply to other molecular gases widely explored in recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Programmable quantum circuits in a large-scale photonic waveguide array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, integrated quantum photonic technologies have shown great potential as a platform for studying quantum phenomena and realizing large-scale quantum information processing. Recently, there have been proposals for utilizing waveguide lattices to implement quantum gates, providing a more compact and robust solution compared to discrete implementation with directional couplers and phase shifters. We report on the first demonstration of precise control of single photon states on an $11\times 11$ continuously-coupled programmable waveguide array. Through electro-optical control, the array is subdivided into decoupled subcircuits and the degree of on-chip quantum interference can be tuned with a maximum visibility of 0.962$\pm$0.013. Furthermore, we show simultaneous control of two subcircuits on a single device. Our results demonstrate the potential of using this technology as a building block for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing classical accelerometers and gyroscopes with a quantum inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>

      <title>Lossy-and-Constrained Extended Non-Local Games with Applications to Cryptography: BC, QKD and QPV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended non-local games are a generalization of monogamy-of-entanglement games, played by two quantum parties and a quantum referee that performs a measurement on their local quantum system. Along the lines of the NPA hierarchy, the optimal winning probability of those games can be upper bounded by a hierarchy of semidefinite programs (SDPs) converging to the optimal value. Here, we show that if one extends such games by considering constraints and loss, motivated by experimental errors and loss through quantum communication, the convergence of the SDPs to the optimal value still holds. We give applications of this result, and we compute SDPs that show tighter security of protocols for relativistic bit commitment, quantum key distribution, and quantum position verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements and measurement-controlled gates are supported by an increasing number of quantum hardware platforms and will become more relevant as an essential building block for quantum error correction. However, mid-circuit measurements impose significant demands on the quantum hardware due to the required signal analysis and classical feedback loop. This work presents a static circuit optimization algorithm that can substitute some of these measurements with an equivalent circuit with randomized gate applications. Our method uses ideas from constant propagation to classically precompute measurement outcome probabilities. Our proposed optimization is efficient, as its runtime scales polynomially on the number of qubits and gates of the circuit.</description>

Abstract: Classical algorithms for market equilibrium computation such as proportional response dynamics face scalability issues with Internet-based applications such as auctions, recommender systems, and fair division, despite having an almost linear runtime in terms of the product of buyers and goods. In this work, we provide the first quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation with sub-linear performance. Our algorithm provides a polynomial runtime speedup in terms of the product of the number of buyers and goods while reaching the same optimization objective value as the classical algorithm. Numerical simulations of a system with 16384 buyers and goods support our theoretical results that our quantum algorithm provides a significant speedup.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Normalizing Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of quantum computing technology, we have entered the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Therefore, designing quantum algorithms that adapt to the hardware conditions of current NISQ devices and can preliminarily solve some practical problems has become the focus of researchers. In this paper, we focus on quantum generative models in the field of quantum machine learning, and propose a hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow (HQCNF) model based on parameterized quantum circuits. Based on the ideas of classical normalizing flow models and the characteristics of parameterized quantum circuits, we cleverly design the form of the ansatz and the hybrid method of quantum and classical computing, and derive the form of the loss function in the case that quantum computing is involved. We test our model on the image generation problem. Experimental results show that our model is capable of generating images of good quality. Compared with other quantum generative models, such as quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN), our model achieves lower (better) Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) score, and compared with classical generative models, we can complete the image generation task with significantly fewer parameters. These results prove the advantage of our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-swapping in generalised probabilistic theories, and iterated CHSH games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there exist theories that have states "more strongly entangled" than quantum theory, in the sense that they show CHSH values above Tsirelson's bound, all known examples of such theories have a strictly smaller set of measurements. Therefore, in tasks which require both bipartite states and measurements, they do not perform better than QM. One of the simplest information processing tasks involving both bipartite states and measurements is that of entanglement swapping. In this paper, we study entanglement swapping in generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs). In particular, we introduce the iterated CHSH game, which measures the power of a GPT to preserve non-classical correlations, in terms of the largest CHSH value obtainable after $n$ rounds of entanglement swapping. Our main result is the construction of a GPT that achieves a CHSH value of $4$ after an arbitrary number of rounds. This addresses a question about the optimality of quantum theory for such games recently raised in the literature. One challenge faced when treating this problem is that there seems to be no general framework for constructing GPTs in which entanglement swapping is a well-defined operation. Therefore, we introduce an algorithmic construction that turns a bipartite GPT into a multipartite GPT that supports entanglement swapping, if consistently possible.</description>

      <title>Analysis of ion chain sympathetic cooling and gate dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sympathetic cooling is a technique often employed to mitigate motional heating in trapped-ion quantum computers. However, choosing system parameters such as number of coolants and cooling duty cycle for optimal gate performance requires evaluating trade-offs between motional errors and other slower errors such as qubit dephasing. The optimal parameters depend on cooling power, heating rate, and ion spacing in a particular system. In this study, we aim to analyze best practices for sympathetic cooling of long chains of trapped ions using analytical and computational methods. We use a case study to show that optimal cooling performance is achieved when coolants are placed at the center of the chain and provide a perturbative upper-bound on the cooling limit of a mode given a particular set of cooling parameters. In addition, using computational tools, we analyze the trade-off between the number of coolant ions in a chain and the center-of-mass mode heating rate. We also show that cooling as often as possible when running a circuit is optimal when the qubit coherence time is otherwise long. These results provide a roadmap for how to choose sympathetic cooling parameters to maximize circuit performance in trapped ion quantum computers using long chains of ions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in the applications of quantum information science in astrophysical settings, especially for the neutrino transport in compact objects where three-flavors of neutrinos need to be mapped on qutrits, we review properties of one- and two-qudit systems. We contrast two-qubit and two-qudits systems by pointing out how some of the properties of two-qubit systems generalize to higher dimensions and explore emerging new properties for dimensions three or higher. One example is provided by the Werner states: when the density operator is written in the fundamental representation, we show that only two-qubit Werner states can be pure states, but not two-qudit Werner states when the qudit dimension is larger than two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce pentacene-doped naphthalene as a material for diamagnetic levitation, offering compelling applications in matter-wave interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Pentacene-doped naphthalene offers remarkable polarizability of its nuclear spin ensemble, achieving polarization rates exceeding 80 % at cryogenic temperatures with polarization lifetimes extending weeks. We design a multi-spin Stern-Gerlach-type interferometry protocol which, thanks to the homogeneous spin distribution and the absence of a preferential nuclear-spin quantization axis, avoids many of the limitations associated with materials hosting electronic spin defects, such as nanodiamonds containing NV centers. We assess the potential of our interferometer to enhance existing bounds on the free parameters of objective collapse models. Beyond matter-wave interferometry, we analyze the prospects for implementing magic angle spinning at frequencies surpassing the current standard in NMR, capitalizing on the exceptional rotational capabilities offered by levitation. Additionally, we outline a novel protocol for measuring spin ensemble polarization via the position of the nanoparticle and conduct an analysis of dominant noise sources, benchmarking the required isolation levels for various applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Spectroscopy via Generalized Quantum Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Response theory has a successful history of connecting experimental observations with theoretical predictions. Of particular interest is the optical response of matter, from which spectroscopy experiments can be modelled. However, the calculation of response properties for quantum systems is often prohibitively expensive, especially for nonlinear spectroscopy, as it requires access to either the time evolution of the system or to excited states. In this work, we introduce a generalized quantum phase estimation framework designed for multi-variate phase estimation. This allows the treatment of general correlation functions enabling the recovery of response properties of arbitrary orders. The generalized quantum phase estimation circuit has an intuitive construction that is linked with a physical process of interest, and can directly sample frequencies from the distribution that would be obtained experimentally. In addition, we provide a single-ancilla modification of the new framework for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Overall, our framework enables the efficient simulation of spectroscopy experiments beyond the linear regime, such as Raman spectroscopy. This opens up an exciting new field of applications for quantum computers with potential technological impact.</description>

Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is the phenomenon in which locally inaccessible energy is activated as extractable work through collaborative local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with an entangled partner. It closely resembles the more well-known quantum information teleportation (QIT) where quantum information can be sent through an entangled pair with LOCC. It is tempting to ask how QET is related to QIT. Here we report a first study of this connection. Despite the apparent similarity, we show that these two phenomena are not only distinct but moreover are mutually exclusive to each other. We show a perturbative trade-off relation between their performance in a thermal entangled chaotic many-body system, in which both QET and QIT are simultaneously implemented through a traversable wormhole in an emergent spacetime. To better understand their competition, we study the finite-dimensional counterpart of two entangled qudits and prove a universal non-perturbative trade-off bound. It shows that for any teleportation scheme, the overall performance of QET and QIT together is constrained by the amount of the entanglement resource. We discuss some explanations of our results.</description>

      <title>Charge and Spin Sharpening Transitions on Dynamical Quantum Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of monitored systems can exhibit a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) between entangling and disentangling phases, tuned by the measurement rate. When the dynamics obeys a continuous symmetry, the entangling phase further splits into a fuzzy phase and a sharp phase based on the scaling of fluctuations of the symmetry charge. While the sharpening transition for Abelian symmetries is well understood analytically, no such understanding exists for the non- Abelian case. In this work, building on a recent analytical solution of the MIPT on tree-like circuit architectures (where qubits are repatedly added or removed from the system in a recursive pattern), we study entanglement and sharpening transitions in monitored dynamical quantum trees obeying U (1) and SU (2) symmetries. The recursive structure of tree tensor networks enables powerful analytical and numerical methods to determine the phase diagrams in both cases. In the U (1) case, we analytically derive a Fisher-KPP-like differential equation that allows us to locate the critical point and identify its properties. We find that the entanglement/purification and sharpening transitions generically occur at distinct measurement rates. In the SU (2) case, we find that the fuzzy phase is generic, and a sharp phase is possible only in the limit of maximal measurement rate. In this limit, we analytically solve the boundaries separating the fuzzy and sharp phases, and find them to be in agreement with exact numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for solving combinatorial optimization problems on digital quantum computers, where we incorporate auxiliary counterdiabatic (CD) terms into the adiabatic Hamiltonian, while integrating bias terms derived from an iterative digitized counterdiabatic quantum algorithm. We call this protocol bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO). Designed to effectively tackle large-scale combinatorial optimization problems, BF-DCQO demonstrates resilience against the limitations posed by the restricted coherence times of current quantum processors and shows clear enhancement even in the presence of noise. Additionally, our purely quantum approach eliminates the dependency on classical optimization required in hybrid classical-quantum schemes, thereby circumventing the trainability issues often associated with variational quantum algorithms. Through the analysis of an all-to-all connected general Ising spin-glass problem, we exhibit a polynomial scaling enhancement in ground state success probability compared to traditional DCQO and finite-time adiabatic quantum optimization methods. Furthermore, it achieves scaling improvements in ground state success probabilities, increasing by up to two orders of magnitude, and offers an average 1.3x better approximation ratio than the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for the problem sizes studied. We validate these findings through experimental implementations on both trapped-ion quantum computers and superconducting processors, tackling a maximum weighted independent set problem with 36 qubits and a spin-glass on a heavy-hex lattice with 100 qubits, respectively. These results mark a significant advancement in gate-based quantum computing, employing a fully quantum algorithmic approach.</description>

      <title>A geometrical description of non-Hermitian dynamics: speed limits in finite rank density operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian dynamics in quantum systems preserves the rank of the state density operator. We use this insight to develop its geometrical description. In particular, we identify mutually orthogonal coherent and incoherent directions and give their physical interpretation. This understanding allows us to optimize the success rate for implementing non-Hermitian driving along prescribed trajectories. We show its significance for shortcuts to adiabaticity. We introduce the geometrical interpretation of a speed limit for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and analyze its tightness. We derive the explicit expression that saturates such a speed limit and illustrate our results on a minimal example of a dissipative qubit.</description>

      <title>An Abstraction Hierarchy Toward Productive Quantum Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experience from seven decades of classical computing suggests that a sustainable computer industry depends on a community of software engineers writing programs to address a wide variety of specific end-user needs, achieving both performance and utility in the process. Quantum computing is an emerging technology, and we do not yet have the insight to understand what quantum software tools and practices will best support researchers, software engineers, or applications specialists. Developers for today's quantum computers are grappling with the low-level details of the hardware, and progress towards scalable devices does not yet suggest what higher-level abstractions may look like. In this paper, we analyze and reframe the current state of the quantum software stack using the language of programming models. We propose an abstraction hierarchy to support quantum software engineering and discuss the consequences of overlaps across the programming, execution, and hardware models found in current technologies. We exercise this hierarchy for solving the eigenvalue estimation problem in two ways (a variational algorithm with error mitigation, and phase estimation with error correction) and pinpoint key differences in these approaches in terms of these layered models and their overlaps. While our work points to concrete conceptual challenges and gaps in quantum programming and proposes some specific steps forward, our primary thesis is that progress hinges on thinking about the abstraction hierarchy holistically, and not just about its components.</description>

      <title>Principal eigenstate classical shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given many copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho$, we consider the task of learning a classical description of its principal eigenstate. Namely, assuming that $\rho$ has an eigenstate $|\phi\rangle$ with (unknown) eigenvalue $\lambda &gt; 1/2$, the goal is to learn a (classical shadows style) classical description of $|\phi\rangle$ which can later be used to estimate expectation values $\langle \phi |O| \phi \rangle$ for any $O$ in some class of observables. We consider the sample-complexity setting in which generating a copy of $\rho$ is expensive, but joint measurements on many copies of the state are possible. We present a protocol for this task scaling with the principal eigenvalue $\lambda$ and show that it is optimal within a space of natural approaches, e.g., applying quantum state purification followed by a single-copy classical shadows scheme. Furthermore, when $\lambda$ is sufficiently close to $1$, the performance of our algorithm is optimal--matching the sample complexity for pure state classical shadows.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of 3D Ion Crystal Dynamics in a Penning Trap using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics, including laser cooling, of 3D ion crystals confined in a Penning trap using a newly developed molecular dynamics-like code. The numerical integration of the ions' equations of motion is accelerated using the fast multipole method to calculate the Coulomb interaction between ions, which allows us to efficiently study large ion crystals with thousands of ions. In particular, we show that the simulation time scales linearly with ion number, rather than with the square of the ion number. By treating the ions' absorption of photons as a Poisson process, we simulate individual photon scattering events to study laser cooling of 3D ellipsoidal ion crystals. Initial simulations suggest that these crystals can be efficiently cooled to ultracold temperatures, aided by the mixing of the easily cooled axial motional modes with the low frequency planar modes. In our simulations of a spherical crystal of 1,000 ions, the planar kinetic energy is cooled to several millikelvin in a few milliseconds while the axial kinetic energy and total potential energy are cooled even further. This suggests that 3D ion crystals could be well-suited as platforms for future quantum science experiments.</description>

      <title>Lineshape Optimization in Inhomogeneous $\Lambda$-type Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum memory is a crucial elementary operation in photonic quantum information processing. While many physically distinct memory protocols and hardware implementations have been applied to this task, the development of a quantum memory performant in all relevant metrics simultaneously (e.g., efficiency, bandwidth, lifetime, etc.) is still an open challenge. In this work, we focus on inhomogeneously broadened ensembles of $\Lambda$-type quantum emitters, which have long coherence lifetimes and broad bandwidth compatibility, but tend to exhibit low efficiency, in part due to technical constraints on medium growth and preparation, and in part due to inefficient use of a key resource in these systems: the inhomogeneously broadened excited state lineshape. We investigate the properties of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for a survey of inhomogeneous lineshapes that are straightforward to realize experimentally, and optimize the memory efficiency for each lineshape over a large range of experimental parameters. We compare the optimal EIT efficiency to the well-known atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol, which also relies on spectral shaping of the inhomogeneous broadening, and observe that with sufficient control field power the optimized lineshapes allow more efficient storage. Finally, we optimize over the inhomogeneous lineshape in a protocol agnostic fashion by numerically constructing the linear integral kernel describing the memory interaction and using a singular value decomposition and interpolation procedure to ensure optimality of the resulting lineshape.</description>

      <title>Control landscapes for high-fidelity generation of C-NOT and C-PHASE gates with coherent and environmental driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High fidelity generation of two-qubit gates is important for quantum computation, since such gates are components of popular universal sets of gates. Here we consider the problem of high fidelity generation of two-qubit C-NOT and C-PHASE (with a detailed study of C-Z) gates in presence of the environment. We consider the general situation when qubits are manipulated by coherent and incoherent controls; the latter is used to induce generally time-dependent decoherence rates. For estimating efficiency of optimization methods for high fidelity generation of these gates, we study quantum control landscapes which describe the behaviour of the fidelity as a function of the controls. For this, we generate and analyze the statistical distributions of best objective values obtained by incoherent GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (inGRAPE) approach. We also apply inGRAPE and stochastic zero-order method to numerically estimate minimal infidelity values. The results are different from the case of single-qubit gates and indicate a smooth trap-free behaviour of the fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum systems, generative quantum machine learning (QML) offers the potential to outperform classical learning models. Current generative QML algorithms mostly rely on general-purpose models that, while being very expressive, face several training challenges. A potential way to address these setbacks involves constructing problem-informed models capable of more efficient training on structured problems. In particular, probabilistic graphical models provide a flexible framework for representing structure in generative learning problems and can thus be exploited to incorporate inductive bias in QML algorithms. In this work, we propose a problem-informed quantum circuit Born machine Ansatz for learning the joint probability distribution of random variables, with independence relations efficiently represented by a Markov network (MN). We further demonstrate the applicability of the MN framework in constructing generative learning benchmarks and compare our model's performance to previous designs, showing it outperforms problem-agnostic circuits. Based on a preliminary analysis of trainability, we narrow down the class of MNs to those exhibiting favorable trainability properties. Finally, we discuss the potential of our model to offer quantum advantage in the context of generative learning.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantumness via Photon Statistics for Time-Bin based Quantum Random Number Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness is one of the essential components in many fields including cryptography and simulations. Several Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) models have been proposed to produce quantum random numbers, which, due to the quantum theory, are more secure than their classical counterparts. However, QRNGs can not produce true random numbers without deterministic classical post-processing. If the underlying distribution of the QRNG is close to a uniform distribution, a small amount of post-processing is sufficient to produce good random numbers retaining quantumness. In this work, we address the randomness and quantumness in the random numbers generated by the QRNGs. We consider two models of QRNGs, which ideally produce random numbers following different distributions (exponential and uniform), and show that, in practice, they are following similar distributions. These empirical photon distributions can be used to test the quantumness of a QRNG. In this letter, we suggest the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit to test quantumness, as it is known to be an effective method to test if sample data follows a known distribution. We derive a relation when the underlying sampling distributions of the QRNGs will be $\epsilon$-random. Depending on this relation, a suitable post-processing algorithm can be chosen.</description>

      <title>Microwave Quantum Illumination with Optical Memory and Single-Mode Phase-Conjugate Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave quantum illumination with entangled pairs of microwave signal and optical idler modes, can achieve the sub-optimal performance with joint measurement of the signal and idler modes. Here, we first propose a testbed of microwave quantum illumination with an optical memory which is simulated with a delay line in the idler mode. It provides how much an input two-mode squeezing is necessary to compensate the loss of the optical memory, while maintaining quantum advantage over coherent state. When the memory is lossy, the input two-mode squeezing has to be higher through high cooperativity in the optical mode. Under the testbed, we propose a single-mode phase conjugate receiver that consists of a low-reflectivity beam splitter, an electro-optomechanical phase conjugator, and a photon number resolving detector. The performance of the newly proposed receiver approaches the maximum quantum advantage for local measurement. Furthermore, the quantum advantage is obtained even with an on-off detection while being robust against the loss of the memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a kind of power-law-exponential (PLE) dipole-dipole interaction between quantum emitters in a 1D waveguide QED system. This unconventional long-range interaction is the combination of power-law growth and exponential decay couplings. Applying PLE interaction to a spin model, we uncover the rich many-body phases. Most remarkably, we find that PLE interaction can induce the ordered and critical spiral phases. These spiral phases emerge from the strong frustration generated by the power-law factor of PLE interaction, hence they are absent for other types of long-range interaction, e.g., pure exponential and power-law decay interactions. Our work is also applicable for the higher dimensional systems. It fundamentally broadens the realm of many-body physics and has the significant applications in quantum simulation of strong correlated matters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadrillion dimensional Hilbert space hosted by a quantum processor with over 50 physical qubits has been expected to be powerful enough to perform computational tasks ranging from simulations of many-body physics to complex financial modeling. Despite few examples and demonstrations, it is still not clear how we can utilize such a large Hilbert space as a computational resource; in particular, how a simple and small quantum system could solve non-trivial computational tasks. In this paper, we show a simple Ising model capable of performing such non-trivial computational tasks in a quantum neural network model. An Ising spin chain as small as ten qubits can solve a practical image classification task with high accuracy. To evaluate the mechanism of its computation, we examine how the symmetries of the Hamiltonian would affect its computational power. We show how the interplay between complexity and integrability/symmetries of the quantum system dictates the performance as quantum neural network.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Quantum Error Mitigation using Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike closed systems, where the total energy and information are conserved within the system, open systems interact with the external environment which often leads to complex behaviors not seen in closed systems. The random fluctuations that arise due to the interaction with the external environment cause noise affecting the states of the quantum system, resulting in system errors. To effectively concern quantum error in open quantum systems, this paper introduces a novel approach to mitigate errors using diffusion models. This approach can be realized by noise occurrence formulation during the state evolution as forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE) and adapting the score-based generative model (SGM) to denoise errors in quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of weak-field homodyne (WF) measurement for quantum communications over a lossy bosonic channel with coherent state encoding. This kind of receiver employs photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors with finite resolution and low-intensity local oscillator. As a figure of merit, we consider the mutual information for a Gaussian input modulation. We prove an enhancement over Shannon capacity in the photon starved regime, obtained by exploiting information on the mean signal energy to suitably optimize the local oscillator intensity. Thereafter, we investigate the performance of non-Gaussian modulation, by considering a Gamma distribution of the energy of the encoded pulses, and achieve an increase in the information rate with respect to the Gaussian modulation case in the intermediate energy regime, being more accentuated for low values of the PNR resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence constitutes a foundational characteristic of quantum mechanics and is integral to emerging quantum resource theories. However, quantum coherence is severely restricted by environmental noise in general quantum processing, indicated by the loss of information of a quantum system. Such processing can be described by the trade-offs between the coherence and the mixedness. Based on the $l_2$ norm coherence, conditional von Neumann entropy and Wigner-Yanase skew information, we derive basis-independent constraints on the attainable quantum coherence imposed by the mixedness of a quantum state, which generalize the prior basis-dependent relations, provide fundamental insights into the latent coherence resources present within arbitrary quantum systems that undergo decoherence and quantify the inherent limits on extractable coherence imposed by environmental noise.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimisation with improved information sharing for the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed empirical analysis of Bayesian optimisation with information sharing (BOIS) for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The method is applied to computing the potential energy surfaces (PES) of the hydrogen and water molecules. We performed noise-free simulations and investigated the algorithms' performance under the influence of noise for the hydrogen molecule, using both emulated and real quantum hardware (IBMQ System One). Based on the noise free simulations we compared different existing information sharing schemes and proposed a new one, which trades parallelisability of the algorithm for a significant reduction in the amount of quantum computing resources required until convergence. In particular, our numerical experiments show an improvement by a factor of 1.5 as compared to the previously reported sharing schemes in H2, and at least by a factor of 5 as compared to no sharing in H2O. Other algorithmic aspects of the Bayesian optimisation, namely, the acquisition weight decrease rate and kernel, are shown to have an influence on the quantum computation (QC) demand of the same order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Bell Nonlocality from Wigner Negativity in Qudit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively studied in systems of qubits. For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We propose a family of Bell inequalities that inquire correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$ gate, which, in the bipartite case, is an abstraction of the CHSH inequality. The classical bound is simple to compute, and a specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on the Wigner negativity and an inequality between the 1-norm and the maximum norm. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we give deterministic Bell violations, as well as violations with a constant number of measurements, for the Bell state relying on operators innate to higher-dimensional systems than the qudit at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable characterization of quantum states as well as any potential noise in various quantum systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. In this work we propose the concept of corrupted sensing quantum state tomography which enables the simultaneous reconstruction of quantum states and structured noise with the aid of simple Pauli measurements only. Without additional prior information, we investigate the reliability and robustness of the framework. The power of our algorithm is demonstrated by assuming Gaussian and Poisson sparse noise for low-rank state tomography. In particular, our approach is able to achieve a high quality of the recovery with incomplete sets of measurements and is also suitable for performance improvement of large quantum systems. It is envisaged that the techniques can become a practical tool to greatly reduce the cost and computational effort for quantum tomography in noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the complexity geometry associated with the Hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system, specifically in cases where the Hamiltonian is explicitly time-dependent. Using Nielsen's geometric formulation of circuit complexity, we calculate the bi-invariant cost associated with these time-dependent Hamiltonians by suitably regularising their norms and obtain analytical expressions of the costs for several well-known time-dependent quantum mechanical systems. Specifically, we show that an equivalence exists between the total costs of obtaining an operator through time evolution generated by a unit mass harmonic oscillator whose frequency depends on time, and a harmonic oscillator whose both mass and frequency are functions of time. These results are illustrated with several examples, including a specific smooth quench protocol where the comparison of time variation of the cost with other information theoretic quantities, such as the Shannon entropy, is discussed.</description>

Abstract: The hydrogen atom perturbed by a constant 1-dimensional weak quadratic potential $\lambda z^2$ is solved at first-order perturbation theory using the eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator - the coupled basis. Physical applications of this result could be found, for example, in the study of a quadratic Zeeman effect weaker than fine-structure effects, or in a perturbation caused by instantaneous generalised van der Waals interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metrological limits of thermometry operated in nonequilibrium dynamical regimes are analyzed. We consider a finite-dimensional quantum system, employed as a quantum thermometer, in contact with a thermal bath inducing Markovian thermalization dynamics. The quantum thermometer is initialized in a generic quantum state, possibly including quantum coherence w.r.t. the Hamiltonian basis. We prove that the sensitivity of the thermometer, quantified by the quantum Fisher information, is enhanced by the quantum coherence in its initial state. We analytically show this in the specific case of qubit thermometers for which the maximization of the quantum Fisher information occurs at a finite time during the transient of the thermalization dynamics. Such a finite-time sensitivity enhancement can be better than the sensitivity that is achieved asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essence of the Mpemba effect is that non-equilibrium systems may relax faster the further they are from their equilibrium configuration. In the quantum realm, this phenomenon arises in the dynamics of closed systems, where it is witnessed by fundamental features such as symmetry and entanglement. Here, we study the quantum Mpemba effect in charge-preserving random circuits on qudits via entanglement asymmetry, combining extensive numerical simulations and analytical mapping to a classical statistical mechanics problem. We show that the more asymmetric certain classes of initial states (tilted ferromagnets) are, the faster they restore symmetry and reach the grand-canonical ensemble. Conversely, other classes of states (tilted antiferromagnets) do not show the Mpemba effect. Our analysis is based on minimal principles -- locality, unitarity, and symmetry. Consequently, our results represent a significant advancement in clarifying the emergence of Mpemba physics in generic systems, including Hamiltonian and Floquet quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: The formation of non-Gaussian states (Schrodinger cat-like state, negativity of the Wigner function) during the parametric down-conversion process is studied when the pump mode is considered quantum and depleted. The Schrodinger cat-like state is formed in the fundamental and second harmonic modes, and the negativity in both modes is studied for certain initial state conditions and interaction lengths. The Wigner function is used to visualize qualitatively non-Gaussian states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transversal gates are logical gate operations on encoded quantum information that are efficient in gate count and depth, and are designed to minimize error propagation. Efficient encoding circuits for quantum codes that admit transversal gates are thus crucial to reduce noise and realize useful quantum computers. The class of punctured Quantum Reed-Muller codes admit transversal gates. We construct resource efficient recursive encoders for the class of quantum codes constructed from Reed-Muller and punctured Reed-Muller codes. These encoders on $n$ qubits have circuit depth of $O(\log n)$ and lower gate counts compared to previous works. The number of CNOT gates in the encoder across bi-partitions of the qubits is found to be equal to the entanglement entropy across these partitions, demonstrating that the encoder is optimal in terms of CNOT gates across these partitions. Finally, connecting these ideas, we explicitly show that entanglement can be extracted from QRM codewords.</description>

      <title>High fidelity distribution of triggered polarization-entangled telecom photons via a 36km intra-city fiber network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-based distribution of triggered, entangled, single-photon pairs is a key requirement for the future development of terrestrial quantum networks. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for deterministic sources of on-demand polarization-entangled photon pairs. So far, the best QD polarization-entangled-pair sources emit in the near-infrared wavelength regime, where the transmission distance in deployed fibers is limited. Here, to be compatible with existing fiber network infrastructures, bi-directional polarization-conserving quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is employed to convert the QD emission from \unit[780]{nm} to telecom wavelengths. We show the preservation of polarization entanglement after QFC (fidelity to Bell state $F_{\phi^+, conv}=0.972\pm0.003$) of the biexciton transition. As a step towards real-world applicability, high entanglement fidelities ($F_{\phi^+, loop}=0.945\pm0.005$) after the propagation of one photon of the entangled pair along a \unit[35.8]{km} field installed standard single mode fiber link are reported. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate a second polarization-conversing QFC step back to \unit[780]{nm} preserving entanglement ($F_{\phi^+, back}=0.903\pm0.005$). This further prepares the way for interfacing quantum light to various quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Buzz: Strategic Paths for Enabling Useful NISQ Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is much debate on whether quantum computing on current NISQ devices, consisting of noisy hundred qubits and requiring a non-negligible usage of classical computing as part of the algorithms, has utility and will ever offer advantages for scientific and industrial applications with respect to traditional computing. In this position paper, we argue that while real-world NISQ quantum applications have yet to surpass their classical counterparts, strategic approaches can be used to facilitate advancements in both industrial and scientific applications. We have identified three key strategies to guide NISQ computing towards practical and useful implementations. Firstly, prioritizing the identification of a "killer app" is a key point. An application demonstrating the distinctive capabilities of NISQ devices can catalyze broader development. We suggest focusing on applications that are inherently quantum, e.g., pointing towards quantum chemistry and material science as promising domains. These fields hold the potential to exhibit benefits, setting benchmarks for other applications to follow. Secondly, integrating AI and deep-learning methods into NISQ computing is a promising approach. Examples such as quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Differentiable Quantum Circuits (DQC) demonstrate the synergy between quantum computing and AI. Lastly, recognizing the interdisciplinary nature of NISQ computing, we advocate for a co-design approach. Achieving synergy between classical and quantum computing necessitates an effort in co-designing quantum applications, algorithms, and programming environments, and the integration of HPC with quantum hardware. The interoperability of these components is crucial for enabling the full potential of NISQ computing.</description>

      <title>Effects of Topological Boundary Conditions on Bell Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality is the resource that enables device-independent quantum information processing tasks. It is revealed through the violation of so-called Bell inequalities, indicating that the observed correlations cannot be reproduced by any local hidden variable model. While well explored in few-body settings, the question of which Bell inequalities are best suited for a given task remains quite open in the many-body scenario. One natural approach is to assign Bell inequalities to physical Hamiltonians, mapping their interaction graph to two-body, nearest-neighbor terms. Here, we investigate the effect of boundary conditions in a two-dimensional square lattice, which can induce different topologies in lattice systems. We find a relation between the induced topology and the Bell inequality's effectiveness in revealing nonlocal correlations. By using a combination of tropical algebra and tensor networks, we quantify their detection capacity for nonlocality. Our work can act as a guide to certify Bell nonlocality in many-qubit devices by choosing a suitable Hamiltonian and measuring its ground state energy; a task that many quantum experiments are purposely built for.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the field of cavity magnonics, a field focused on controlling the interaction between magnons and confined microwave photons within microwave resonators, has drawn significant attention as it offers a platform for enabling advancements in quantum- and spin-based technologies. Here, we introduce excitation vector fields, whose polarisation and profile can be easily tuned in a two-port cavity setup, thus acting as an effective experimental knob to explore the coupled dynamics of cavity magnon-polaritons. Moreover, we develop theoretical models that accurately predict and reproduce the experimental results for any polarisation state and field profile within the cavity resonator. This versatile experimental platform offers a new avenue for controlling spin-photon interactions and as such also delivering a mechanism to readily control the exchange of information between hybrid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving a spin interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for the quantum simulation of such models; however, previous experiments have been limited to simulating a scenario where a spin is coherently coupled to bosonic modes, which neglects capturing the dissipation of the bath. In our work, we perform quantum simulations of spin-boson models with structured baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to the control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with spectral densities composed of up to three Lorentzian peaks. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, suggesting the advantage of adding the trapped-ion system's experimental noise for simulating open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently demonstrated that a large number of magnetic sensing technologies satisfy the energy resolution limit, which connects a quantity composed by the variance of the magnetic field estimate, the sensor volume and the measurement time, and having units of action, with $\hbar$. A first-principles derivation of the energy resolution limit is still elusive. We here present such a derivation based on quantum thermodynamic arguments. We show that the energy resolution limit is a result of quantum thermodynamic work associated with quantum measurement and Landauer erasure, the work being exchanged with the magnetic field. We apply these considerations to atomic magnetometers and SQUIDS. Regarding the former, we unravel a new spin correlation effect relevant to the magnetic noise produced by atomic vapors.</description>

      <title>Quantum amplitude estimation from classical signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the problem of amplitude estimation, a core subroutine used in many quantum algorithms, can be mapped directly to a problem in signal processing called direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. The DOA task is to determine the direction of arrival of an incoming wave with the fewest possible measurements. The connection between amplitude estimation and DOA allows us to make use of the vast amount of signal processing algorithms to post-process the measurements of the Grover iterator at predefined depths. Using an off-the-shelf DOA algorithm called ESPRIT together with a compressed-sensing based sampling approach, we create a phase-estimation free, parallel quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) algorithm with a total query complexity of $\sim 4.9/\varepsilon$ and a parallel query complexity of $\sim 0.40/\varepsilon$ at 95% confidence. This performance is a factor of $1.1\times$ and $14\times$ improvement over Rall and Fuller [Quantum 7, 937 (2023)], for worst-case complexity, which to our knowledge is the best published result for amplitude estimation. The approach presented here provides a simple, robust, parallel method to performing QAE, with many possible avenues for improvement borrowing ideas from the wealth of literature in classical signal processing.</description>

      <title>Scalable embedding of parity constraints in quantum annealing hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main bottlenecks in solving combinatorial optimization problems with quantum annealers is the qubit connectivity in the hardware. A possible solution for larger connectivty is minor embedding. This techniques makes the geometrical properties of the combinatorial optimization problem, encoded as a Hamiltonian, match the properties of the quantum annealing hardware. The embedding itself is a hard computational problem and therefore heuristic algorithms are required. In this work, we present fixed, modular and scalable embeddings that can be used to embed any combinatorial optimization problem described as an Ising Hamiltonian. These embeddings are the result of an extension of the well-known parity mapping, which has been used in the past to map higher-order Ising Hamiltonians to quadratic Hamiltonians, which are suitable for existing quantum hardware. We show how our new embeddings can be mapped to existing quantum annealers and that the embedded Hamiltonian physical properties match the original Hamiltonian properties.</description>

      <title>Qudit generalization of the qubit echo and its application to a qutrit-based Toffoli gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fidelity of certain gates on noisy quantum computers may be improved when they are implemented using more than two levels of the involved transmons. The main impediments to achieving this potential are the dynamic gate phase errors that cannot be corrected via calibration. The standard tool for countering such phase errors in two-level qubits is the echo protocol, often referred to as the dynamical decoupling sequence, where the evolution of a qubit is punctuated by an even number of X gates. We introduce basis cycling, which is a direct generalization of the qubit echo to general qudits, and provide a framework in which to design gate sequences to produce desired effects using this technique. We then apply basis cycling to a Toffoli gate decomposition incorporating a qutrit and obtain a CCZ gate fidelity of 93.8 +- 0.1 via quantum process tomography on an IBM quantum computer. The gate fidelity remains stable without recalibration even while the resonant frequency of the qutrit fluctuates, highlighting the dynamical nature of phase error cancellation through basis cycling. Our results demonstrate that one of the biggest difficulties in implementing qudit-based gate decompositions on superconducting quantum computers can be systematically overcome when certain conditions are met, and thus open a path toward fulfilling the promise of qudits as gate optimization agents.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Speed-Up for Approximating the Top Eigenvectors of a Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a good approximation of the top eigenvector of a given $d\times d$ matrix $A$ is a basic and important computational problem, with many applications. We give two different quantum algorithms that, given query access to the entries of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and assuming a constant eigenvalue gap, output a classical description of a good approximation of the top eigenvector: one algorithm with time complexity $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(d^{1.75})$ and one with time complexity $d^{1.5+o(1)}$ (the first algorithm has a slightly better dependence on the $\ell_2$-error of the approximating vector than the second, and uses different techniques of independent interest). Both of our quantum algorithms provide a polynomial speed-up over the best-possible classical algorithm, which needs $\Omega(d^2)$ queries to entries of $A$, and hence $\Omega(d^2)$ time. We extend this to a quantum algorithm that outputs a classical description of the subspace spanned by the top-$q$ eigenvectors in time $qd^{1.5+o(1)}$. We also prove a nearly-optimal lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1.5})$ on the quantum query complexity of approximating the top eigenvector.
  Our quantum algorithms run a version of the classical power method that is robust to certain benign kinds of errors, where we implement each matrix-vector multiplication with small and well-behaved error on a quantum computer, in different ways for the two algorithms. Our first algorithm estimates the matrix-vector product one entry at a time, using a new ``Gaussian phase estimation'' procedure. Our second algorithm uses block-encoding techniques to compute the matrix-vector product as a quantum state, from which we obtain a classical description by a new time-efficient unbiased pure-state tomography procedure.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian way for the relaxation time approximation, application to Kibble-Zurek processes due to environment temperature quench, and to Lindbladian perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, a global Lindbladian ansatz is constructed which leads to thermalization at temperature $T$ to the Gibs state of the investigated system. This ansatz connects every two eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and leads to a simple master equation known in the literature as the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The main message of this paper is that RTA, being a Lindbladian approach itself, can be used as Lindbladian securing thermalization when modeling physical processes, and can be consequently combined with other types of Lindbladians which would drive the system of the equilibrium state. I demonstrate it with two applications. The first application is the slow cooling (or heating) of quantum systems by varying the environment temperature to a critical point. With this RTA-Lindblad ansatz, one can directly relate to the equilibrium behavior of the system, and if an order parameter has the exponent $\Psi$, the remaining value at the phase transition will decrease with $1/\tau^{\Psi}$, where $\tau$ is the overall time of the slow process. In the second application, I investigate the change in the expectation value of a conserved quantity (an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian) due to an extra Lindbladian term which would drive the system out from equilibrium, while the thermalizing RTA-Lindbladian term is also present. I give a closed perturbative expression in the first order for the expectation value in the new steady state using only expectation values calculated in the original thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Analog Counterdiabatic Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose analog counterdiabatic quantum computing (ACQC) to tackle combinatorial optimization problems on neutral-atom quantum processors. While these devices allow for the use of hundreds of qubits, adiabatic quantum computing struggles with non-adiabatic errors, which are inevitable due to the hardware's restricted coherence time. We design counterdiabatic protocols to circumvent those limitations via ACQC on analog quantum devices with ground-Rydberg qubits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our paradigm, we experimentally apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem with up to 100 qubits and show an enhancement in the approximation ratio with a short evolution time. We believe ACQC establishes a path toward quantum advantage for a variety of industry use cases.</description>

      <title>Borromean states in a one-dimensional three-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of Borromean bound states in a one-dimensional quantum three-body system composed of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle. It is assumed that there is no interaction between the two bosons, while the mass-imbalanced two-body subsystems can be tuned to be either bound or unbound. Within the framework of the Faddeev equations, the three-body spectrum and the corresponding wave functions are computed numerically. In addition, we identify the parameter-space region for the two-body interaction, where the Borromean states occur, evaluate their geometric properties, and investigate their dependence on the mass ratio.</description>

Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore exact generalized symmetries in the standard 2+1d lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to the Ising model, and compare them with their continuum field theory counterparts. One model has a (non-anomalous) non-invertible symmetry, and we identify two distinct non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases. The non-invertible algebra involves a lattice condensation operator, which creates a toric code ground state from a product state. Another model has a mixed anomaly between a 1-form symmetry and an ordinary symmetry. This anomaly enforces a nontrivial transition in the phase diagram, consistent with the "Higgs=SPT" proposal. Finally, we discuss how the symmetries and anomalies in these two models are related by gauging, which is a 2+1d version of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang theory of the superradiant phase transition in the open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dicke model describes an ensemble of two-level atoms that are coupled to a confined light mode of an optical cavity. Above a critical coupling, the cavity becomes macroscopically occupied, and the system enters the superradiant phase. This phase transition can be observed by detecting the photons that are emitted from the cavity; however, it only becomes apparent in the limit of long observation times, while actual experiments are of a finite duration. To circumvent this problem, we here make use of recent advances in Lee-Yang theories of phase transitions to show that the superradiant phase transition can be inferred from the factorial cumulants of the photon emission statistics obtained during a finite measurement time. Specifically, from the factorial cumulants, we can determine the complex singularities of generating functions that describe the photon emission statistics, and by extrapolating their positions to the long-time limit, one can detect the superradiant phase transition. We also show that the convergence points determine the tails of the large-deviation statistics of the photon current. Our work demonstrates how phase transitions in the Dicke model and in other quantum many-body systems can be detected from measurements of a finite duration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Xu et al. introduced the concept of an interband character for a time-dependent quantum system. This quantity is gauge invariant and quantized as integer values, analogous to the Euler characteristic based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a manifold with a smooth boundary. In this work, we find that the geometric shift vector in momentum space from shift currents in the bulk photovoltaic effect is equivalent to the quantum geometric potential and plays the role of geodesic curvature, that is, of a quantum system whose parameter space is the Bloch momentum. We reveal the intricate relationships among geometric quantities such as the shift vector, Berry curvature, and quantum metric. Additionally, we present the Wilson representation for the quantized interband character and extend our analysis to bosonic photon and phonon drag shift vectors with non-vertical transitions. The application of Wilson loop method facilitates first-principles calculations, providing insights into the geometric underpinnings of these interband gauge invariant quantities and shedding light on their nonlinear optical manifestations in real materials.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic spacetimes have been known to offer analogue models for black hole physics and cosmology. Within this context, aspects of analogue quantum field theories in curved spacetime are studied. In particular some new comments have been made on the analogue Hawking temperature including a quick derivation of the result. Further, analogue cosmology is explored, within which, an acoustic version of the Parker-Toms model is proposed and the corresponding quantities have been calculated. The limits of the acoustic analogue are emphasised.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends previous findings on the modified Schr\"odinger evolution inspired by quantum gravity phenomenology. By establishing a connection between this approach and fractional quantum mechanics, we provide insights into a potential deep infrared regime of quantum gravity, characterized by the emergence of fractal dimensions, similar to behaviors observed in the deep ultraviolet regime. Additionally, we briefly explore the requirements for experimental investigations of this regime using Bose-Einstein condensates. Notably, our analysis reveals a direct implication of this analogy: experiments probing fractional quantum mechanics may serve as equivalent models of quantum gravity. We identify instances of nonlocal behavior in such systems, suggesting an analogous phenomenon of nonlocality in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Tracking Chirality in Photoelectron Circular Dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) originates from the interplay between a molecule's chiral nuclear scaffold and a circularly polarized ionizing laser field. It is one of the most sensitive characterization techniques for the chirality of molecules in the gas phase. However, due to the complexity of the observable, it is generally difficult to predict and track how and when the chirality of the molecule is imprinted onto the photoelectron. Here, we present simulations of PECD for single-photon ionization in a hydrogenic single-electron model with an artificial chiral potential. This framework allows us to systematically tune the system's chirality and characterize the emergence of PECD. To this end, we propose chirality measures for potentials and wave functions to establish a quantitative connection with the resulting anisotropy in the photelectron distribution. We show that these chirality measures are suitable indicators for chirality in our model, paving the way for tracking the evolution of chirality from the nuclear scaffold to the final observable.</description>

      <title>Tackling Decision Processes with Non-Cumulative Objectives using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model a wide variety of applications ranging from game playing over robotics to finance. Their optimal policy typically maximizes the expected sum of rewards given at each step of the decision process. However, a large class of problems does not fit straightforwardly into this framework: Non-cumulative Markov decision processes (NCMDPs), where instead of the expected sum of rewards, the expected value of an arbitrary function of the rewards is maximized. Example functions include the maximum of the rewards or their mean divided by their standard deviation. In this work, we introduce a general mapping of NCMDPs to standard MDPs. This allows all techniques developed to find optimal policies for MDPs, such as reinforcement learning or dynamic programming, to be directly applied to the larger class of NCMDPs. Focusing on reinforcement learning, we show applications in a diverse set of tasks, including classical control, portfolio optimization in finance, and discrete optimization problems. Given our approach, we can improve both final performance and training time compared to relying on standard MDPs.</description>

      <title>A fixed phase tunable directional coupler based on coupling tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of photonic integrated circuits has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a growing demand for devices that offer high-performance reconfigurability. Due to the inability of conventional tunable directional couplers (TDCs) to maintain a fixed phase while tuning the reflectivity, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are employed as the primary building blocks for reflectivity tuning in constructing large-scale circuits. However, MZIs are prone to fabrication errors due to the need for perfect balanced directional couplers to achieve 0-1 reflectivity, which hinders their scalability. In this study, we introduce a design of a TDC based on coupling constant tuning in the thin film Lithium Niobate platform and present an optimized design. Our optimized TDC design enables arbitrary reflectivity tuning while ensuring a consistent phase across a wide range of operating wavelengths. Furthermore, it exhibits fewer bending sections than MZIs and is inherently resilient to fabrication errors in waveguide geometry and coupling length compared to both MZIs and conventional TDCs. Our work contributes to developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits with implications for various fields, including optical communication systems and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames from Top-Down Crossed Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All physical observations are made relative to a reference frame, which is a system in its own right. If the system of interest admits a group symmetry, the reference frame observing it must transform commensurately under the group to ensure the covariance of the combined system. We point out that the crossed product is a way to realize quantum reference frames from the bottom-up; adjoining a quantum reference frame and imposing constraints generates a crossed product algebra. We provide a top-down specification of crossed product algebras and show that one cannot obtain inequivalent quantum reference frames using this approach. As a remedy, we define an abstract algebra associated to the system and symmetry group built out of relational crossed product algebras associated with different choices of quantum reference frames. We term this object the G-framed algebra, and show how potentially inequivalent frames are realized within this object. We comment on this algebra's analog of the classical Gribov problem in gauge theory, its importance in gravity where we show that it is relevant for semiclassical de Sitter and potentially beyond the semiclassical limit, and its utility for understanding the frame-dependence of physical notions like observables, density states, and entropies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics in chaotic quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an ensemble of two-dimensional nonintegrable quantum circuits that are chaotic but have a conserved particle current, and thus a finite Drude weight. The long-wavelength hydrodynamics of such systems is given by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By analyzing circuit-to-circuit fluctuations in the ensemble we argue that these are negligible, so the circuit-averaged value of transport coefficients like the viscosity is also (in the long-time limit) the value in a typical circuit. The circuit-averaged transport coefficients can be mapped onto a classical irreversible Markov process. Therefore, remarkably, our construction allows us to efficiently compute the viscosity of a family of strongly interacting chaotic two-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect for a $Q$-clock type system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetocaloric effect applied to a magnetic working substance corresponding to a square lattice of spins with $Q$ possible orientations known as the ``$Q$-state clock model" where for $Q\geq 5$, the systems present the famous Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase (BKT). Thermodynamic quantities are obtained in exact form for a small lattice size of $L \times L$ with $L=3$ and by the mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations for $Q$ pairs between 2 and 8 with $L = 3, 8, 16, 32$ with free boundary conditions, and magnetic fields varying between $B = 0$ and $1$ in natural units of the system. By obtaining the entropy, it is possible to quantify the caloric effect through an isothermal process in which the external magnetic field on the spin system is varied. In particular, we find the values of $Q$ that maximize the effect depending on the lattice size and the magnetic phase transitions related to maximizing the caloric phenomena. These indicate that in a small lattice (up to $\sim 7\times 7$), when $Q\geq 5$, the transition that maximizes the effect is related to ferromagnetic to BKT type. In contrast, transitioning from BKT to paramagnetic type increases the system's caloric response when we work with a larger lattice size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are an attractive platform for quantum computing, but their performance is degraded primarily by fluctuating electromagnetic environments. We introduce the concept of ballast charges, which are induced charges on the surface of an additional screening layer situated below the qubits. The counteractive behavior of these charges can significantly reduce the power spectral density associated with fluctuations from two-level systems that contribute to charge noise. Our simulations show that the dephasing time of a spin qubit in a Si/SiGe device increases by a factor of 4 to 6 on average when using this method. We also discuss the physical implementation and potential challenges of this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on transport characteristics of field effect two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) in 24 nm wide indium arsenide surface quantum wells. High quality single-subband magnetotransport with clear quantized integer quantum Hall plateaus are observed to filling factor $\nu=2$ in magnetic fields of up to B = 18 T, at electron densities up to 8$\times 10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Peak mobility is 11,000 cm$^2$/Vs at 2$\times 10^{12}$ /cm$^2$. Large Rashba spin-orbit coefficients up to 124 meV$\cdot$\r{A} are obtained through weak anti-localization (WAL) measurements. Proximitized superconductivity is demonstrated in Nb-based superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junctions, yielding 78$-$99% interface transparencies from superconducting contacts fabricated ex-situ (post-growth), using two commonly-used experimental techniques for measuring transparencies. These transparencies are on a par with those reported for epitaxially-grown superconductors. These SNS junctions show characteristic voltages $I_c R_{\text{N}}$ up to 870 $\mu$V and critical current densities up to 9.6 $\mu$A/$\mu$m, among the largest values reported for Nb-InAs SNS devices.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatial patterns and synchronization in superconducting time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a time crystal phase characterized by a frequency half of the driving frequency in disordered superconductors by employing the time dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism at zero temperature with a periodically driven coupling constant. After a period of exponential increase of spatial inhomogeneities and exponential suppression of the order parameter amplitude, the time crystal develops islands of different sizes. Each of these islands is a time crystal with the same frequency albeit with a phase shift $\pi$ with respect to the homogeneous time crystal. After its emergence, the island gradually becomes smaller, though the phase shift persists, until it is abruptly synchronized at a time that it depends on its initial size. We find a critical disorder strength, still deep in the metallic phase, at which the time crystal phase terminates. For even stronger disorder, the order parameter oscillates with the driving frequency in regions where localization effects are not important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

Abstract: We show that turning on the interaction of relativistic spinless particles with the vacuum of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) leads to the replacement of the Klein-Gordon equation with the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation. In this case, coordinate time becomes an operator and free relativistic particles go into a virtual state. We discuss geometry associated with classical and quantum Klein-Gordon oscillators, and its relation to the geometry underlying the description of free particles.</description>

      <title>A high-level comparison of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for breaking asymmetric cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a high-level cost comparison between Regev's quantum algorithm with Eker{\aa}-G\"artner's extensions on the one hand, and existing state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for factoring and computing discrete logarithms on the other. This when targeting cryptographically relevant problem instances, and when accounting for the space-saving optimizations of Ragavan and Vaikuntanathan that apply to Regev's algorithm, and optimizations such as windowing that apply to the existing algorithms.
  Our conclusion is that Regev's algorithm without the space-saving optimizations may achieve a per-run advantage, but not an overall advantage, if non-computational quantum memory is cheap. Regev's algorithm with the space-saving optimizations does not achieve an advantage, since it uses more computational memory, whilst also performing more work, per run and overall, compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. As such, further optimizations are required for it to achieve an advantage for cryptographically relevant problem instances.</description>

      <title>Qubit-efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms for Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is expected to transform a range of computational tasks beyond the reach of classical algorithms. In this work, we examine the application of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for unsupervised image segmentation to partition images into separate semantic regions. Specifically, we formulate the task as a graph cut optimization problem and employ two established qubit-efficient VQAs, which we refer to as Parametric Gate Encoding (PGE) and Ancilla Basis Encoding (ABE), to find the optimal segmentation mask. In addition, we propose Adaptive Cost Encoding (ACE), a new approach that leverages the same circuit architecture as ABE but adopts a problem-dependent cost function. We benchmark PGE, ABE and ACE on synthetically generated images, focusing on quality and trainability. ACE shows consistently faster convergence in training the parameterized quantum circuits in comparison to PGE and ABE. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the scalability of these approaches against the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), showing a significant cutback in the quantum resources, especially in the number of qubits that logarithmically depends on the number of pixels. The results validate the strengths of ACE, while concurrently highlighting its inherent limitations and challenges. This paves way for further research in quantum-enhanced computer vision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize textbook experiments on Bose-Einstein condensate tunnelling through thin repulsive potential barriers. In particular, we demonstrate atom tunnelling though a single optical barrier in the quantum scattering regime where the De Broglie wavelength of the atoms is larger than the barrier width. Such a beam splitter can be used for atom interferometry and we study the case of two barriers creating an atomic Fabry-P{\'e}rot cavity. Technically, the velocity of the atoms is reduced thanks to the use of a 39K Bose-Einstein condensate with no interactions. The potential barriers are created optically and their width is tunable thanks to the use of a digital micro-mirror device. In addition, our scattering experiments enable in-situ characterization of the optical aberrations of the barrier optical system.</description>

Abstract: We study the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold plate and a graphene-covered dielectric grating. Using a scattering matrix (S-matrix) approach derived from the Fourier Modal Method (FMM), we find a significant enhancement in the CLF as compared to a mere dielectric slab coated with graphene, over a wide range of temperatures. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CLF depends strongly on the chemical potential of graphene, with maximal effects observed at lower filling fractions. Finally, we analyse the Casimir force gradient between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated dielectric grating, highlighting potential avenues for experimental measurements.</description>

Abstract: The combination of different kinds of ultracold gases constitutes a novel powerful experimental framework for the investigation of a variety of physical problems. We illustrate the differences among possible quantum mixtures, be they homonuclear spin mixtures or heteronuclear ones, and show how they can be exploited to investigate a plethora of topics from the few-body to the many-body regimes. In particular, we discuss quantum mixtures of ultracold gases under three different perspectives: systems made of a few atoms of different kinds, single impurities immersed in a host quantum gas, and quantum mixtures of two interacting gases. Given the broad spectrum of possible topics and experimental regimes, in this review we restrict the discussion on single harmonic or flat traps, predominantly in a three-dimensional configuration. A selection of results on recent experiments and possible interesting future directions are given.</description>

      <title>Giant splitting of the hydrogen rotational eigenenergies in the C$_2$ filled ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen hydrates present a rich phase diagram influenced by both pressure and temperature, with the so-called C$_2$ phase emerging prominently above 2.5 GPa. In this phase, hydrogen molecules are densely packed within a cubic ice-like lattice and the interaction with the surrounding water molecules profoundly affects their quantum rotational dynamics. Herein, we delve into this intricate interplay by directly solving the Schr\"{o}dinger's equation for a quantum H$_2$ rotor in the C$_2$ crystal field at finite temperature, generated through Density Functional Theory. Our calculations reveal a giant energy splitting relative to the magnetic quantum number of $\pm$3.2 meV for $l=1$. Employing inelastic neutron scattering, we experimentally measure the energy levels of H$_2$ within the C$_2$ phase at 6.0 and 3.4 GPa and low temperatures, finding remarkable agreement with our theoretical predictions. These findings underscore the pivotal role of hydrogen--water interactions in dictating the rotational behavior of the hydrogen molecules within the C$_2$ phase and indicate heightened induced-dipole interactions compared to other hydrogen hydrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a quantum system with its environment limits qubit coherence times and restricts its utility in quantum information processing applications. In this Letter, we show that the decoherence of a coupled qubit system can be minimized, or even eliminated by exploiting the quantum coherence of the bath itself. We investigate the dephasing in a system of two spatially separated, electronically decoupled qubits, with direct or mediated coupling, interacting with a shared bath. For illustration we treat F\"orster or cavity-mediated coupling between semiconductor quantum dots interacting with acoustic phonons. Using the rigorous method of Trotter's decomposition with cumulant expansion, we demonstrate a reduction in the dephasing rates at specific distances. This control is a coherent effect of the shared bath and is absent for independent baths. It can be understood in terms of phonon-assisted transitions between the entangled qubit states of the coupled system.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid and significant advancements in deep learning for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, the challenge of learning robust molecular representations that effectively generalize in real-world scenarios to novel compounds remains an elusive and unresolved task. This study examines how atom-level pretraining with quantum mechanics (QM) data can mitigate violations of assumptions regarding the distributional similarity between training and test data and therefore improve performance and generalization in downstream tasks. In the public dataset Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), we show how pretraining on atom-level QM improves performance overall and makes the activation of the features distributes more Gaussian-like which results in a representation that is more robust to distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hidden state molecular representations are analyzed to compare the effects of molecule-level and atom-level pretraining on QM data.</description>

      <title>The Channel Capacity of a Relativistic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I explore the limitations on the capacity of a relativistic channel to transmit power and information that arise because of the finiteness of the transverse speed of light. As a model system, I consider a rope constructed from a fundamental string, for which relativistic invariance is built in. By wiggling one end of the string, both power and information may be transmitted to the other end. I argue that even though an unbounded amount of power and information may be traveling down the string, there is a bound on how much may be transmitted. Further, I conjecture that the two kinds of channel capacity -- power and information -- interfere with each other, so that the only way to transmit the maximum amount of power is to send no information, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar resonance spectroscopy of individual nuclei using a room-temperature quantum sensor</title>

Abstract: Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: Classifying states as entangled or separable is a fundamental, but expensive task. This paper presents a method, the forest algorithm, to improve the amount of resources needed to detect entanglement. Starting from 'optimized' methods for using geometric criterion to detect entanglement, specific steps are replaced with machine learning models. Tests using numerical simulations indicate that the model is able to declare a state as entangled in fewer steps compared to existing methods. This improvement is achieved without affecting the correctness of the original algorithm.</description>

      <title>Identification of malfunctioning quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.02729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of correctly identifying a malfunctioning quantum device that forms part of a network of $N$ such devices, which can be considered as the quantum analogue of classical anomaly detection. In the case where the devices in question are sources assumed to prepare identical quantum pure states, with the faulty source producing a different anomalous pure state, we show that the optimal probability of successful identification requires a global quantum measurement. We also put forth several local measurement strategies -- both adaptive and non-adaptive, that achieve the same optimal probability of success in the limit where the number of devices to be checked are large. In the case where the faulty device performs a known unitary operation we show that the use of entangled probes provides an improvement that even allows perfect identification for values of the unitary parameter that surpass a certain threshold. Finally, if the faulty device implements a known qubit channel we find that the optimal probability for detecting the position of rank-one and rank-two Pauli channels can be achieved by product state inputs and separable measurements for any size of network, whereas for rank-three and general amplitude damping channels optimal identification requires entanglement with N qubit ancillas.</description>

      <title>Determination of All Unknown Pure Quantum States with Two Observables</title>

Abstract: Efficiently extracting information from pure quantum states using minimal observables on the main system is a longstanding and fundamental issue in quantum information theory. Despite the inability of probability distributions of position and momentum to uniquely specify a wavefunction, Peres conjectured a discrete version wherein two complementary observables, analogous to position and momentum and realized as projective measurements onto orthogonal bases, can determine all pure qudits up to a finite set of ambiguities. Subsequent findings revealed the impossibility of uniquely determining $d$-dimenisonal pure states even when neglecting a measure-zero set with any two orthogonal bases, and Peres's conjecture is also correct for $d=3$ but not for $d=4$. In this study, we show that two orthogonal bases are capable of effectively filtering up to $2^{d-1}$ finite candidates by disregarding a measure-zero set, without involving complex numbers in the bases' coefficients. Additionally, drawing inspiration from sequential measurements to directly calculate the target coefficients of the wavefunction using two complementary observables, we show that almost all pure qudits can be uniquely determined by adaptively incorporating a POVM in the middle, followed by measuring the complementary observable.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators in Kicked Coupled Tops: Information Scrambling in Mixed Phase Space and the Role of Conserved Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operator growth in a bipartite kicked coupled tops (KCT) system using out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs), which quantify ``information scrambling" due to chaotic dynamics and serve as a quantum analog of classical Lyapunov exponents. In the KCT system, chaos arises from the hyper-fine coupling between the spins. Due to a conservation law, the system's dynamics decompose into distinct invariant subspaces. Focusing initially on the largest subspace, we numerically verify that the OTOC growth rate aligns well with the classical Lyapunov exponent for fully chaotic dynamics. While previous studies have largely focused on scrambling in fully chaotic dynamics, works on mixed-phase space scrambling are sparse. We explore scrambling behavior in both mixed-phase space and globally chaotic dynamics. In the mixed phase space, we use Percival's conjecture to partition the eigenstates of the Floquet map into ``regular" and ``chaotic." Using these states as the initial states, we examine how their mean phase space locations affect the growth and saturation of the OTOCs. Beyond the largest subspace, we study the OTOCs across the entire system, including all other smaller subspaces. For certain initial operators, we analytically derive the OTOC saturation using random matrix theory (RMT). When the initial operators are chosen randomly from the unitarily invariant random matrix ensembles, the averaged OTOC relates to the linear entanglement entropy of the Floquet operator, as found in earlier works. For the diagonal Gaussian initial operators, we provide a simple expression for the OTOC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The innate complexity of solid state physics exposes superconducting quantum circuits to interactions with uncontrolled degrees of freedom degrading their coherence. By using a simple stabilization sequence we show that a superconducting fluxonium qubit is coupled to a two-level system (TLS) environment of unknown origin, with a relatively long energy relaxation time exceeding $50\,\text{ms}$. Implementing a quantum Szilard engine with an active feedback control loop allows us to decide whether the qubit heats or cools its TLS environment. The TLSs can be cooled down resulting in a four times lower qubit population, or they can be heated to manifest themselves as a negative temperature environment corresponding to a qubit population of $\sim 80\,\%$. We show that the TLSs and the qubit are each other's dominant loss mechanism and that the qubit relaxation is independent of the TLS populations. Understanding and mitigating TLS environments is therefore not only crucial to improve qubit lifetimes but also to avoid non-Markovian qubit dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The power of quantum sensing rests on its ultimate precision limit, quantified by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB), which can surpass classical bounds. In multi-parameter estimation, the QCRB is not always saturated as the quantum nature of associated observables may lead to their incompatibility. Here we explore the precision limits of multi-parameter estimation through the lens of quantum geometry, enabling us to experimentally evaluate the QCRB via quantum geometry measurements. Focusing on two- and three-parameter estimation, we elucidate how fundamental quantum uncertainty principles prevent the saturation of the bound. By linking a metric of "quantumness" to the system geometric properties, we investigate and experimentally extract the attainable QCRB for three-parameter estimations.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations of the Hamiltonian dynamics of a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer - a digital twin - could play a major role in developing efficient and scalable strategies for tuning quantum algorithms for specific hardware. Via a two-dimensional tensor network digital twin of a Rydberg atom quantum computer, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a program. In particular, we quantify the effects of gate crosstalks induced by the van der Waals interaction between Rydberg atoms: according to an 8$\times$8 digital twin simulation based on the current state-of-the-art experimental setups, the initial state of a five-qubit repetition code can be prepared with a high fidelity, a first indicator for a compatibility with fault-tolerant quantum computing. The preparation of a 64-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with about 700 gates yields a $99.9\%$ fidelity in a closed system while achieving a speedup of $35\%$ via parallelization.</description>

      <title>Impact of the form of weighted networks on the quantum extreme reservoir computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum extreme reservoir computation (QERC) is a versatile quantum neural network model that combines the concepts of extreme machine learning with quantum reservoir computation. Key to QERC is the generation of a complex quantum reservoir (feature space) that does not need to be optimized for different problem instances. Originally, a periodically-driven system Hamiltonian dynamics was employed as the quantum feature map. In this work we capture how the quantum feature map is generated as the number of time-steps of the dynamics increases by a method to characterize unitary matrices in the form of weighted networks. Furthermore, to identify the key properties of the feature map that has sufficiently grown, we evaluate it with various weighted network models that could be used for the quantum reservoir in image classification situations. At last, we show how a simple Hamiltonian model based on a disordered discrete time crystal with its simple implementation route provides nearly-optimal performance while removing the necessity of programming of the quantum processor gate by gate.</description>

Abstract: Harmonic oscillators belong to the most fundamental concepts in physics and are central to many current research fields such as circuit QED, cavity optomechanics and photon-pressure systems. Here, we engineer a microwave mode in a superconducting LC circuit that mimics the dynamics of a negative mass oscillator, and couple it via photon-pressure to a second low-frequency circuit. We demonstrate that the effective negative mass dynamics lead to an inversion of dynamical backaction and to sideband-cooling of the low-frequency circuit by a blue-detuned pump field, which can be intuitively understood by the inverted energy ladder of a negative mass oscillator.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of quantifying the information content of a source for an arbitrary information theory, where the information content is defined in terms of the asymptotic achievable compression rate. The functions that solve this problem in classical and quantum theory are Shannon's and von Neumann's entropy, respectively. However, in a general information theory there are three different functions that extend the notion of entropy, and this opens the question as to whether any of them can universally play the role of the quantifier for the information content. Here we answer the question in the negative, by evaluating the information content as well as the various entropic functions in a toy theory called Bilocal Classical Theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a unitary evolution $U$ on a multi-partite quantum system and an ensemble of initial states, how well can $U$ be simulated by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) on that ensemble? We answer this question by establishing a general, efficiently computable upper bound on the maximal LOCC simulation fidelity -- what we call an 'LOCC inequality'. We then apply our findings to the fundamental setting where $U$ implements a quantum Newtonian Hamiltonian over a gravitationally interacting system. Violation of our LOCC inequality can rule out the LOCCness of the underlying evolution, thereby establishing the non-classicality of the gravitational dynamics, which can no longer be explained by a local classical field. As a prominent application of this scheme we study systems of quantum harmonic oscillators initialised in coherent states following a normal distribution and interacting via Newtonian gravity, and discuss a possible physical implementation with torsion pendula. One of our main technical contributions is the analytical calculation of the above LOCC inequality for this family of systems. As opposed to existing tests based on the detection of gravitationally mediated entanglement, our proposal works with coherent states alone, and thus it does not require the generation of largely delocalised states of motion nor the detection of entanglement, which is never created at any point in the process.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate quantum advantage with several basic assumptions, specifically based on only the existence of OWFs. We introduce inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ), and construct it from classical bit commitments. IV-PoQ is an interactive protocol between a verifier and a quantum prover consisting of two phases. In the first phase, the verifier is probabilistic polynomial-time, and it interacts with the prover. In the second phase, the verifier becomes inefficient, and makes its decision based on the transcript of the first phase. If the prover is honest, the inefficient verifier accepts with high probability, but any classical malicious prover only has a small probability of being accepted by the inefficient verifier. Our construction demonstrates the following results: (1)If one-way functions exist, then IV-PoQ exist. (2)If distributional collision-resistant hash functions exist (which exist if hard-on-average problems in $\mathbf{SZK}$ exist), then constant-round IV-PoQ exist. We also demonstrate quantum advantage based on worst-case-hard assumptions. We define auxiliary-input IV-PoQ (AI-IV-PoQ) that only require that for any malicious prover, there exist infinitely many auxiliary inputs under which the prover cannot cheat. We construct AI-IV-PoQ from an auxiliary-input version of commitments in a similar way, showing that (1)If auxiliary-input one-way functions exist (which exist if $\mathbf{CZK}\not\subseteq\mathbf{BPP}$), then AI-IV-PoQ exist. (2)If auxiliary-input collision-resistant hash functions exist (which is equivalent to $\mathbf{PWPP}\nsubseteq \mathbf{FBPP}$) or $\mathbf{SZK}\nsubseteq \mathbf{BPP}$, then constant-round AI-IV-PoQ exist.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is among the most fundamental-and at the same time puzzling-properties of quantum physics. Its modern description relies on a resource-theoretical approach, which treats entangled systems as a means to enable or accelerate certain informational tasks. Hence, it is of crucial importance to determine whether-and how-different entangled states can be converted into each other under free operations (those which do not create entanglement from nothing). Here, we show that the majorization lattice provides an efficient framework in order to characterize the allowed transformations of pure entangled states under local operations and classical communication. The underlying notions of meet $\land$ and join $\lor$ in the majorization lattice lead us to define, respectively, the optimal common resource and optimal common product states. Based on these two states, we introduce two optimal probabilistic protocols for the (single-copy) conversion of incomparable bipartite pure states, which we name greedy and thrifty. Both protocols reduce to Vidal's protocol [G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 1046 (1999)] if the initial and final states are comparable, but otherwise the thrifty protocol can be shown to be superior to the greedy protocol as it yields a more entangled residual state when it fails (they both yield the same entangled state with the same optimal probability when they succeed). Finally, we consider the generalization of these protocols to entanglement transformations involving multiple initial or final states.</description>

Abstract: The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova &amp; Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Training Quantum Boltzmann Machines with the $\beta$-Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM) is a generative machine learning model for both classical data and quantum states. Training the QBM consists of minimizing the relative entropy from the model to the target state. This requires QBM expectation values which are computationally intractable for large models in general. It is therefore important to develop heuristic training methods that work well in practice. In this work, we study a heuristic method characterized by a nested loop: the inner loop trains the $\beta$-variational quantum eigensolver ($\beta$-VQE) by Liu et al (2021 Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol.2 025011) to approximate the QBM expectation values; the outer loop trains the QBM to minimize the relative entropy to the target. We show that low-rank representations obtained by $\beta$-VQE provide an efficient way to learn low-rank target states, such as classical data and low-temperature quantum tomography. We test the method on both classical and quantum target data with numerical simulations of up to 10 qubits. For the cases considered here, the obtained QBMs can model the target to high fidelity. We implement a trained model on a physical quantum device. The approach offers a valuable route towards variationally training QBMs on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the efficacy of the Petz recovery map within the context of two paradigmatic quantum channels: dephasing and amplitude-damping. While prior investigations have predominantly focused on qubits, our research extends this inquiry to higher-dimensional systems. We introduce a novel, state-independent framework based on the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism to evaluate the performance of the Petz map. By analyzing different channels and the (non-)unital nature of these processes, we emphasize the pivotal role of the reference state selection in determining the map's effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the considerable impact of suboptimal choices on performance, prompting a broader consideration of factors such as system dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent feedback control of an N-level atom with multiple excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network, where an $N$-level atom is coupled with a cavity and the cavity is also coupled with single or multiple parallel waveguides. When the atom is initialized at the highest energy level, it can emit multiple photons into the cavity, and the photons can be further transmitted to the waveguides and re-interact with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system. The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multi-photon states. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and the stability of quantum states is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Complexity of Quantum Boltzmann Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Boltzmann machines (QBMs) are machine-learning models for both classical and quantum data. We give an operational definition of QBM learning in terms of the difference in expectation values between the model and target, taking into account the polynomial size of the data set. By using the relative entropy as a loss function this problem can be solved without encountering barren plateaus. We prove that a solution can be obtained with stochastic gradient descent using at most a polynomial number of Gibbs states. We also prove that pre-training on a subset of the QBM parameters can only lower the sample complexity bounds. In particular, we give pre-training strategies based on mean-field, Gaussian Fermionic, and geometrically local Hamiltonians. We verify these models and our theoretical findings numerically on a quantum and a classical data set. Our results establish that QBMs are promising machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on the same trapped ion motional modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type ($J_{ij}^x \sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ + $J_{ij}^y \sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the $J_{ij}^x$ and $J_{ij}^y$ terms. The Ising-type interactions $\sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ and $\sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$ are simultaneously generated by employing two spin-dependent forces operating in parallel on the same set of normal modes. We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+\;$ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory for multipolar composite bosons with mass defect and relativistic corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic high-precision measurements have become a competitive and essential technique for tests of fundamental physics, the Standard Model, and our theory of gravity. It is therefore self-evident that such measurements call for a consistent relativistic description of atoms that eventually originates from quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics. Most quantum-metrological approaches even postulate effective field-theoretical treatments to describe a precision enhancement through techniques like squeezing. However, a consistent derivation of interacting atomic quantum gases from an elementary quantum field theory that includes both the internal structure as well as the center of mass of atoms, has not yet been addressed. We present such a subspace effective field theory for interacting, spin carrying, and possibly charged ensembles of atoms composed of nucleus and electron that form composite bosons called cobosons, where the interaction with light is included in a multipolar description. Relativistic corrections to the energy of a single coboson, light-matter interaction, and the scattering potential between cobosons arise in a consistent and natural manner. In particular, we obtain a relativistic coupling between the coboson's center-of-mass motion and internal structure encoded by the mass defect. We use these results to derive modified bound-state energies, including the motion of ions, modified scattering potentials, a relativistic extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the mass defect applicable to atomic clocks or quantum clock interferometry.</description>

Abstract: Armed with quantum correlations, quantum sensors in a network have shown the potential to outclass their classical counterparts in distributed sensing tasks such as clock synchronization and reference frame alignment. On the other hand, this analysis was done for simple and idealized networks, whereas the correlation shared within a practical quantum network, captured by the notion of network states, is much more complex. Here, we prove a general bound that limits the performance of using quantum network states to estimate a global parameter, establishing the necessity of genuine multipartite entanglement for achieving a quantum advantage. The bound can also serve as an entanglement witness in networks and can be generalized to states generated by shallow circuits. Moreover, while our bound prohibits local network states from achieving the Heisenberg limit, we design a probabilistic protocol that, once successful, attains this ultimate limit of quantum metrology and preserves the privacy of involved parties. Our work establishes both the limitation and the possibility of quantum metrology within quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression of a Wigner function that approximately describes the time evolution of the one-dimensional motion of a particle in a nonharmonic potential. Our method involves two exact frame transformations, accounting for both the classical dynamics of the centroid of the initial state and the rotation and squeezing about that trajectory. Subsequently, we employ two crucial approximations, namely the constant-angle and linearized-decoherence approximations. These approximations are effective in the regime of wide potentials and small fluctuations, namely potentials that enable spatial expansions orders of magnitude larger than the one of the initial state but that remain smaller compared to the relevant dynamical length scale (e.g., distance between turning points). Our analytical result elucidates the interplay between classical and quantum physics and the impact of decoherence during nonlinear dynamics. This analytical result is instrumental to design, optimize and understand proposals using nonlinear dynamics to generate macroscopic quantum states of massive particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent and measurement feedback control based on atoms coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that quantum feedback control may be applied to generate desired states for atomic and photonic systems based on a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this set-up, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, which can be reflected by the terminal mirror or other atoms to establish different feedback loops via the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Thus, in the open system atom-waveguide interactions, measurement-based feedback can modulate the final steady quantum state, while simultaneously, the homodyne detection noise in the measurement process can induce oscillations, which is treated by the coherent feedback designs.</description>

      <title>Fidelity and Entanglement of Random Bipartite Pure States: Insights and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fidelity of Haar random bipartite pure states from a fixed reference quantum state and their bipartite entanglement. By plotting the fidelity and entanglement on perpendicular axes, we observe that the resulting plots exhibit non-uniform distributions. The distribution depends on the entanglement of the fixed reference quantum state used to quantify the fidelity of the random pure bipartite states. We find that the average fidelity of typical random pure bipartite qubits within a narrow entanglement range with respect to a randomly chosen fixed bipartite qubit is $\frac{1}{4}$. Extending our study to higher dimensional bipartite qudits, we find that the average fidelity of typical random pure bipartite qudits with respect to a randomly chosen fixed bipartite qudit remains constant within a narrow entanglement range. The values of these constants are \(\frac{1}{d^2}\), with d being the dimension of the local Hilbert space of the bipartite qudit system, suggesting a consistent relationship between entanglement and fidelity across different dimensions. The probability distribution functions of fidelity with respect to a product state are analytically studied and used as a reference for the benchmarking of distributed quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded quantum state testing via space-efficient quantum singular value transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by exploring the power of quantum computation with a limited number of qubits, we present a novel complete characterization for space-bounded quantum computation, which encompasses settings with one-sided error (unitary coRQL) and two-sided error (BQL), approached from a quantum state testing perspective:
  - The first family of natural complete problems for unitary coRQL, i.e., space-bounded quantum state certification for trace distance and Hilbert-Schmidt distance;
  - A new family of natural complete problems for BQL, i.e., space-bounded quantum state testing for trace distance, Hilbert-Schmidt distance, and quantum entropy difference.
  In the space-bounded quantum state testing problem, we consider two logarithmic-qubit quantum circuits (devices) denoted as $Q_0$ and $Q_1$, which prepare quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$, respectively, with access to their ``source code''. Our goal is to decide whether $\rho_0$ is $\epsilon_1$-close to or $\epsilon_2$-far from $\rho_1$ with respect to a specified distance-like measure. Interestingly, unlike time-bounded state testing problems, our results reveal that the space-bounded state testing problems all correspond to the same class. Moreover, our algorithms on the trace distance inspire an algorithmic Holevo-Helstrom measurement, implying QSZK is in QIP(2) with a quantum linear-space honest prover.
  Our results primarily build upon a space-efficient variant of the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) introduced by Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019), which is of independent interest. Our technique provides a unified approach for designing space-bounded quantum algorithms. Specifically, we show that implementing QSVT for any bounded polynomial that approximates a piecewise-smooth function incurs only a constant overhead in terms of the space required for special forms of the projected unitary encoding.</description>

Abstract: In the classical regime, thermodynamic state transformations are governed by the free energy. This is also called as the second law of thermodynamics. Previous works showed that, access to a catalytic system allows us to restore the second law in the quantum regime when we ignore coherence. However, in the quantum regime, coherence and free energy are two independent resources. Therefore, coherence places additional non-trivial restrictions on the the state transformations, that remains elusive. In order to close this gap, we isolate and study the nature of coherence, i.e.\ we assume access to a source of free energy. We show that allowing catalysis along with a source of free energy allows us to amplify any quantum coherence present in the quantum state arbitrarily. Additionally, any correlations between the system and the catalyst can be suppressed arbitrarily. Therefore, our results provide a key step in formulating a fully general law of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Solving the time-dependent quantum many-body Schr\"odinger equation is a challenging task, especially for states at a finite temperature, where the environment affects the dynamics. Most existing approximating methods are designed to represent static thermal density matrices, 1D systems, and/or zero-temperature states. In this work, we propose a method to study the real-time dynamics of thermal states in two dimensions, based on thermofield dynamics, variational Monte Carlo, and neural-network quantum states. To this aim, we introduce two novel tools: (i) a procedure to accurately simulate the cooling down of arbitrary quantum variational states from infinite temperature, and (ii) a generic thermal (autoregressive) recurrent neural-network (ARNNO) Ansatz that allows for direct sampling from the density matrix using thermofield basis rotations. We apply our technique to the transverse-field Ising model subject to an additional longitudinal field and demonstrate that the time-dependent observables, including correlation operators, can be accurately reproduced for a 4x4 spin lattice. We provide predictions of the real-time dynamics on a 6x6 lattice that lies outside the reach of exact simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Just a few years after the inception of quantum mechanics, there has been a research program using the nonclassical values of some quasiprobability distributions to delineate the nonclassical aspects of quantum phenomena. In particular, in KD (Kirkwood-Dirac) quasiprobability distribution, the distinctive quantum mechanical feature of noncommutativity which underlies many nonclassical phenomena, manifests in the nonreal values and/or the negative values of the real part. Here, we develop a faithful quantifier of quantum coherence based on the KD nonclassicality which captures simultaneously the nonreality and the negativity of the KD quasiprobability. The KD-nonclassicality coherence thus defined, is upper bounded by the uncertainty of the outcomes of measurement described by a rank-1 orthogonal PVM (projection-valued measure) corresponding to the incoherent orthonormal basis which is quantified by the Tsallis $\frac{1}{2}$-entropy. Moreover, they are identical for pure states so that the KD-nonclassicallity coherence for pure state admits a simple closed expression in terms of measurement probabilities. We then use the Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation for min-entropy and max-entropy to obtain a lower bound for the KD-nonclassicality coherence of a pure state in terms of optimal guessing probability in measurement described by a PVM noncommuting with the incoherent orthonormal basis. We also derive a trade-off relation for the KD-noncassicality coherences of a pure state relative to a pair of noncommuting orthonormal bases with a state-independent lower bound. Finally, we sketch a variational scheme for a direct estimation of the KD-nonclassicality coherence based on weak value measurement and thereby discuss its relation with quantum contextuality.</description>

Abstract: This article focuses on developing classical surrogates for parametrized quantum circuits using interpolation via (trigonometric) polynomials. We develop two algorithms for the construction of such surrogates and prove performance guarantees. The constructions are based on circuit evaluations which are blackbox in the sense that no structural specifics of the circuits are exploited. While acknowledging the limitations of the blackbox approach compared to whitebox evaluations, which exploit specific circuit properties, we demonstrate scenarios in which the blackbox approach might prove beneficial. Sample applications include but are not restricted to the approximation of VQEs and the alleviaton of the barren plateau problem.</description>

      <title>Cross-cap defects and fault-tolerant logical gates in the surface code and the honeycomb Floquet code</title>

Abstract: We consider the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, surface code and Floquet code defined on a non-orientable surface, which can be considered as families of codes extending Shor's 9-qubit code. We investigate the fault-tolerant logical gates of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code in this setup, which corresponds to $e\leftrightarrow m$ exchanging symmetry of the underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. We find that non-orientable geometry provides a new way the emergent symmetry acts on the code space, and discover the new realization of the fault-tolerant Hadamard gate of 2d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code on a surface with a single cross-cap, dubbed a non-orientable toric code. This Hadamard gate can be realized by a constant-depth local unitary circuit modulo non-locality caused by a cross-cap. Via folding, the non-orientable surface code can be turned into a bilayer local quantum code, where the folded cross-cap is equivalent to a bi-layer twist terminated on a gapped boundary and the logical Hadamard only contains local gates with intra-layer couplings. We further obtain the complete logical Clifford gate set for a stack of non-orientable surface codes. We then construct the honeycomb Floquet code in the presence of a single cross-cap, and find that the period of the sequential Pauli measurements acts as a $HZ$ logical gate on the single logical qubit, where the cross-cap enriches the dynamics compared with the orientable case. We find that the dynamics of the honeycomb Floquet code is precisely described by a condensation operator of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and illustrate the exotic dynamics of our code in terms of a condensation operator supported at a non-orientable surface.</description>

Abstract: Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of reliable machine learning models. In this paper, we study these properties in the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against data perturbations. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly involves the parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed and non-trainable encodings, as those frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus, trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. The practical implications of our theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Robust effective ground state in a nonintegrable Floquet quantum circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An external periodic (Floquet) drive is believed to bring any initial state to the featureless infinite temperature state in generic nonintegrable isolated quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, irrespective of the driving frequency $\Omega$. However, numerical or analytical evidence either proving or disproving this hypothesis is very limited and the issue has remained unsettled. Here, we study the initial state dependence of Floquet heating in a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain of length up to $L=30$ with an efficient quantum circuit simulator, showing a possible counterexample: The ground state of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian is exceptionally robust against heating, and could stay at finite energy density even after infinitely many Floquet cycles, if the driving period is shorter than a threshold value. This sharp energy localization transition/crossover does not happen for generic excited states. The exceptional robustness of the ground state is interpreted by (i) its isolation in the energy spectrum and (ii) the fact that those states with $L$-independent $\hbar\Omega$ energy above the ground state energy of any generic local Hamiltonian, like the approximate Floquet Hamiltonian, are atypical and viewed as a collection of noninteracting quasipartiles. Our finding paves the way for engineering Floquet protocols with finite driving periods realizing long-lived, or possibly even perpetual, Floquet phases by initial state design.</description>

      <title>Towards Unclonable Cryptography in the Plain Model</title>

Abstract: By leveraging the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics, unclonable cryptography enables us to achieve novel cryptographic protocols that are otherwise impossible classically. Two most notable examples of unclonable cryptography are copy-protection (CP) and unclonable encryption (UE). Most known constructions rely on the QROM (as opposed to the plain model). Despite receiving a lot of attention in recent years, two important open questions still remain: CP for point functions in the plain model, which is usually considered as feasibility demonstration, and UE with unclonable indistinguishability security in the plain model. A core ingredient of these protocols is the so-called monogamy-of-entanglement (MoE) property. Such games allow quantifying the correlations between the outcomes of multiple non-communicating parties sharing entanglement in a particular context. Specifically, we define the games between a challenger and three players in which the first player is asked to split and share a quantum state between the two others, who are then simultaneously asked a question and need to output the correct answer.
  In this work, by relying on previous works [CLLZ21, CV22], we establish a new MoE property for subspace coset states, which allows us to progress towards the aforementioned goals.
  However, it is not sufficient on its own, and we present two conjectures that would allow first to show that CP of point functions exists in the plain model, with different challenge distributions, and then that UE with unclonable indistinguishability security exists in the plain model.
  We believe that our new MoE to be of independent interest, and it could be useful in other applications as well. To highlight this last point, we leverage our new MoE property to show the existence of a tokenized signature scheme with a new security definition, called unclonable unforgeability.</description>

      <title>A Comparison Between Invariant and Equivariant Classical and Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the vast amounts of data from high-energy particle collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The data from such collision events can naturally be represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis, greatly motivate the development of alternative fast and efficient computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, one can leverage the fundamental symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and equivariant layers. In this paper, we perform a fair and comprehensive comparison between classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their AUC scores, the quantum networks were shown to outperform the classical networks. However, seeing the computational advantage of the quantum networks in practice may have to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated APIs.</description>

Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for translation invariant quantum spin systems has been proved recently by using random matrices. In this paper, we study the subsystem version of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for translation invariant quantum systems without referring to random matrices. We first find a relation between the quantum variance and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. Then, by showing the small upper bounds on the quantum variance and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy, we prove the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for translation invariant quantum systems with an algebraic speed of convergence in an elementary way. The proof holds for most of the translation invariant quantum lattice models with exponential or algebraic decays of correlations.</description>

Abstract: Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a variant of quantum teleportation that, unlike the canonical protocol by Bennett et al., does not require a correction operation on the teleported state. Since its introduction by Ishizaka and Hiroshima in 2008, no efficient implementation of PBT was known. We close this long-standing gap by building on our recent results on representations of partially transposed permutation matrix algebras and mixed quantum Schur transform. We construct efficient quantum algorithms for probabilistic and deterministic PBT protocols on $n$ ports of arbitrary local dimension, both for EPR and optimized resource states. We describe two constructions based on different encodings of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for $n$ qudits: a standard encoding that achieves $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time and $O(n\log(n))$ space complexity, and a Yamanouchi encoding that achieves $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time and $O(\log(n))$ space complexity, both for constant local dimension and target error. We also describe efficient circuits for preparing the optimal resource states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information from decoherence, as long as error rates fall below critical error thresholds. In general, obtaining thresholds implies simulating the QEC procedure using, in general, sub-optimal decoding strategies. In a few cases and for sufficiently simple noise models, optimal decoding of QEC codes can be framed as a phase transition in disordered classical spin models. In both situations, accurate estimation of thresholds demands intensive computational resources. Here we use the coherent information of the mixed state of noisy QEC codes to accurately estimate the associated optimal QEC thresholds already from small-distance codes at moderate computational cost. We show the effectiveness and versatility of our method by applying it first to the topological surface and color code under bit-flip and depolarizing noise. We then extend the coherent information based methodology to phenomenological and quantum circuit level noise settings. For all examples considered we obtain highly accurate estimates of optimal error thresholds from small, low-distance instances of the codes, in close accordance with threshold values reported in the literature. Our findings establish the coherent information as a reliable competitive practical tool for the calculation of optimal thresholds of state-of-the-art QEC codes under realistic noise models.</description>

Abstract: The generation of squeezed Fock states by the one or more photon subtraction from a two-mode entangled Gaussian (TMEG) state is theoretically addressed. We showed that an arbitrary order Fock state can be generated this way and we obtained a condition that should be imposed on the parameters of the TMEG state to guaranty such a generation. We called the regime, in which this condition is satisfied, universal solution regime. We showed that, for first squeezed Fock state, the above condition is redundant such that the generation of the first squeezed Fock state is still possible by a one photon subtraction from an arbitrary TMEG state. At the same time, the maximum generation probability of the first squeezed Fock state generation corresponds to the universal solution regime. We applied the above results to the description of generation of the squeezed Fock states using a beam splitter and a Controlled-Z operation. We have estimated the parameters of such setups and input squeezed states, which are necessary to obtain squeezed Fock states with the maximum probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Floquet period-doubling time-crystal model based on a disordered interacting long-range spin chain where the periodic swapping of nearby spin couples is applied. This protocol can be applied to systems with any local spin magnitude $s$ {and in principle also to systems with nonspin (fermionic or bosonic) local Hilbert space}. We explicitly consider the cases $s = 1/2$ and $s = 1$, using analytical and numerical methods to show that the time-crystal behavior appears in a range of parameters. In particular, we study the persistence of period-doubling oscillations in time, the time-crystal properties of the Floquet spectrum (quasienergy $\pi$-spectral pairing and long-range correlations of the Floquet states), and introduce a quantity (the local imbalance) to assess what initial states give rise to a period-doubling dynamics. We also consider the average level spacing ratio and find that the interval of parameters where the system does not thermalize and persistent period-doubling is possible corresponds to the one where the Floquet spectrum shows time-crystal properties.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Random Access Memory (qRAM) is an essential computing element for running oracle-based quantum algorithms. qRAM exploits the principle of quantum superposition to access all data stored in the memory cell simultaneously and guarantees the superior performance of quantum algorithms. A qRAM memory cell comprises logical qubits encoded through quantum error correction technology for the successful operation of qRAM against various quantum noises. In addition to quantum noise, the low-technology nodes based on silicon technology can increase the qubit density and may introduce defective qubits. As qRAM comprises many qubits, its yield will be reduced by defective qubits; these qubits must be handled using QEC scheme. However, the QEC scheme requires numerous physical qubits, which burdens resource overhead. To resolve this overhead problem, we propose a quantum memory architecture that compensates for defective qubits by introducing redundant qubits. We also analyze the yield improvement offered by our proposed architecture by varying the ideal fabrication error rate from 0.5% to 1% for different numbers of logical qubits in the qRAM. In the qRAM comprising 1,024 logical qubits, eight redundant logical qubits improved the yield by 95.92% from that of qRAM not employing the redundant repair scheme.</description>

Abstract: As quantum circuits become more integrated and complex, additional error sources that were previously insignificant start to emerge. Consequently, the fidelity of quantum gates benchmarked under pristine conditions falls short of predicting their performance in realistic circuits. To overcome this problem, we must improve their robustness against pertinent error models besides isolated fidelity. Here we report the experimental realization of robust quantum gates in superconducting quantum circuits based on a geometric framework for diagnosing and correcting various gate errors. Using quantum process tomography and randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate robust single-qubit gates against quasi-static noise and spatially-correlated noise in a broad range of strengths, which are common sources of coherent errors in large-scale quantum circuit. We also apply our method to non-static noises and to realize robust two-qubit gates. Our work provides a versatile toolbox for achieving noise-resilient complex quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum circuits consisting of Clifford and matchgates are two classes of circuits that are known to be efficiently simulatable on a classical computer. We introduce a unified framework that shows in a transparent way the special structure that allows these circuits can be efficiently simulatable. The approach relies on analyzing the operator spread within a network of basis operators during the evolution of quantum circuit. Quantifying the complexity of a calculation by the number of operators with amplitude above a threshold value, we show that there is a generic form of the complexity curve involving an initial exponential growth, saturation, then exponential decay in the presence of decoherence. Our approach is naturally adaptable into a numerical procedure, where errors can be consistently controlled as a function of the complexity of the simulation.</description>

Abstract: Obeying non-Abelian statistics, Majorana fermions holds a promise to implement fault-tolerant quantum computing. It was found that Majorana fermions can be simulated by the zero-energy excitation in a nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling interacting with an $s$-wave superconductor under a magnetic field. However, the signal of Majorana fermion in that system is obscured by the disorder in the nanowire and the confinement potential at the wire end. Thus, more controllable platforms are desired to simulate Majorana fermions. We here propose an alternative scheme to simulate the Majorana fermions in a trapped-ion system. Our dimerized-ion configuration permits us to generate the Majorana modes not only at zero energy but also at the nonzero ones, which enlarge the family of Majorana modes and supply another qubit carrier for quantum computing. We also investigate the controllability of the Majorana modes by Floquet engineering. It is found that a widely tunable number of Majorana modes are created on demand by applying a periodic driving on the trapped-ion system. Enriching the platforms for simulating Majorana fermions, our result would open another avenue for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Local counterdiabatic driving (CD) provides a feasible approach for realizing approximate reversible/adiabatic processes like quantum state preparation using only local controls and without demanding excessively long protocol times. However, in many instances getting high accuracy of such CD protocols requires engineering very complicated new controls or pulse sequences. In this work, we describe a systematic method for altering the adiabatic path by adding extra local controls along which performance of local CD protocols is enhanced, both close to and far away from the adiabatic limit. We also identify an iterative procedure to improve the performance of local counterdiabatic driving further without any knowledge of the quantum wavefunction. We then show that these methods provides dramatic improvement in the preparation of non-trivial GHZ ground states of several different spin systems with both short-range and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Integrability and chaos in the quantum brachistochrone problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum brachistochrone problem addresses the fundamental challenge of achieving the quantum speed limit in applications aiming to realize a given unitary operation in a quantum system. Specifically, it looks into optimization of the transformation of quantum states through controlled Hamiltonians, which form a small subset in the space of the system's observables. Here we introduce a broad family of completely integrable brachistochrone protocols, which arise from a judicious choice of the control Hamiltonian subset. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the inherent stability of the completely integrable protocols makes them numerically tractable and therefore practicable as opposed to their non-integrable counterparts.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness via matrix product states in the Pauli basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', stands as a crucial resource for achieving a potential advantage in quantum computing. Its connection to many-body physical phenomena is poorly understood at present, mostly due to a lack of practical methods to compute it at large scales. We present a novel approach for the evaluation of nonstabilizerness within the framework of matrix product states (MPS), based on expressing the MPS directly in the Pauli basis. Our framework provides a powerful tool for efficiently calculating various measures of nonstabilizerness, including stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, stabilizer nullity, and Bell magic, and enables the learning of the stabilizer group of an MPS. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our method in the ground states of Ising and XXZ spin chains, as well as in circuits dynamics that has recently been realized in Rydberg atom arrays, where we provide concrete benchmarks for future experiments on logical qubits up to twice the sizes already realized.</description>

      <title>A Profunctorial Semantics for Quantum Supermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify morphisms of strong profunctors as a categorification of quantum supermaps. These black-box generalisations of diagrams-with-holes are hence placed within the broader field of profunctor optics, as morphisms in the category of copresheaves on concrete networks. This enables the first construction of abstract logical connectives such as tensor products and negations for supermaps in a totally theory-independent setting. These logical connectives are found to be all that is needed to abstractly model the key structural features of the quantum theory of supermaps: black-box indefinite causal order, black-box definite causal order, and the factorisation of definitely causally ordered supermaps into concrete circuit diagrams. We demonstrate that at the heart of these factorisation theorems lies the Yoneda lemma and the notion of representability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum non-demolition qubit measurement is critical to error correction and rapid qubit feedback in large-scale quantum computing. High-fidelity readout requires passing a short and strong pulse through the qubit's readout resonator, which is then processed by a sufficiently high bandwidth, high saturation power, and quantum-limited amplifier. We have developed a design pipeline that combines time-domain simulation of the un-truncated device Hamiltonian, fabrication constraints, and maximization of saturation power. We have realized an amplifier based on a modified NIST tri-layer Nb fabrication suite which utilizes an array of 25 radio frequency Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (rf SQUIDs) embedded within a low-Q resonator powered by a high-power voltage pump delivered via a diplexer on the signal port. We show that, despite the intensity of the pump, the device is quantum-efficient and capable of high-fidelity measurement limited by state transitions in the transmon. We present experimental data demonstrating up to -91.2 dBm input saturation power with 20 dB gain, up to 28 MHz instantaneous bandwidth, and phase-preserving qubit measurements with 62% quantum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Activation of entanglement in generalized entanglement swapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study entanglement activation in a generalized entanglement swapping process involving two Bell pairs and generalized measurements. The conventional understanding posits entangled measurements as both necessary and sufficient for establishing entanglement between distant parties. In this study, we reassess the role of measurement operators in entanglement generation within a generalized entanglement swapping process. We focus on maximally entangled two-qubit initial states and generalized measurements, investigating the necessity and sufficiency conditions for entangled measurement operators. By utilizing two Bell pairs, (1, 2) shared between Alice and Bob, and (3, 4) shared between Bob and Charlie, we demonstrate that while entangled measurements are sufficient, they are not indispensable for establishing entanglement between spatially separated observers. Through a sequential approach, if Bob performs an initial measurement which is not able to establish entanglement then followed by another measurement after post-processing the first measurement it is possible to establish entanglement. We identify specific criteria for different measurement operators that enable the potential for performing a second measurement to establish entanglement. Our findings highlight the feasibility of generating entanglement between distant parties through a combination of measurements, shedding light on entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Additionally, we showcase through illustrative examples how successive measurements enhance entanglement compared to single measurements, underscoring the practical benefits of our approach in enhancing entanglement. Moreover, our protocol extends beyond bipartite qubit states to higher-dimensional maximally entangled states, emphasizing its versatility and applicability.</description>

      <title>QUSL: Quantum Unsupervised Image Similarity Learning with Enhanced Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum advantages to enhance machine learning capabilities has become a primary focus of research, particularly for complex tasks such as image similarity detection. To fully exploit the potential of quantum computing, it is essential to design quantum circuits tailored to the specific characteristics of the task at hand. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel quantum unsupervised similarity learning method,QUSL. Building upon the foundation of similarity detection triplets and generating positive samples through perturbations of anchor images, QUSL operates independently of classical oracles. By leveraging the performance of triplets and the characteristics of quantum circuits, QUSL systematically explores high-performance quantum circuit architectures customized for dataset features using metaheuristic algorithms, thereby achieving efficient quantum feature extraction with reduced circuit costs. Comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments on quantum computers demonstrate QUSL's remarkable performance compared to state-of-the-art quantum methods. QUSL achieves reductions exceeding 50% in critical quantum resource utilization while also realizing an enhancement of up to 19.5% in similarity detection correlation across the DISC21, COCO, and landscape datasets. This enables efficient quantum similarity modeling for large-scale unlabeled image data with reduced quantum resource utilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AC susceptometry, unlike static susceptometry, offers a deeper insight into magnetic materials. By employing AC susceptibility measurements, one can glean into crucial details regarding magnetic dynamics. Nevertheless, traditional AC susceptometers are constrained to measuring changes in magnetic moments within the range of a few nano-joules per tesla. Additionally, their spatial resolution is severely limited, confining their application to bulk samples only. In this study, we introduce the utilization of a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) center-based quantum diamond microscope for mapping the AC susceptibility of micron-scale ferromagnetic specimens. By employing coherent pulse sequences, we extract both magnitude and the phase of the field from samples within a field of view spanning 70 micro-meters while achieving a resolution of 1 micro-meter. Furthermore, we quantify changes in dipole moment on the order of a femto-joules per tesla induced by excitations at frequencies reaching several hundred kilohertz.</description>

Abstract: Contraction coefficients give a quantitative strengthening of the data processing inequality. As such, they have many natural applications whenever closer analysis of information processing is required. However, it is often challenging to calculate these coefficients. As a remedy we discuss a quantum generalization of Doeblin coefficients. These give an efficiently computable upper bound on many contraction coefficients. We prove several properties and discuss generalizations and applications. In particular, we give additional stronger bounds. One especially for PPT channels and one for general channels based on a constraint relaxation. Additionally, we introduce reverse Doeblin coefficients that bound certain expansion coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

Abstract: Qubit noise spectroscopy (QNS) is a valuable tool for both the characterization of a qubit's environment and as a precursor to more effective qubit control to improve qubit fidelities. Existing approaches to QNS are what the classical spectrum estimation literature would call "non-parametric" approaches, in that a series of probe sequences are used to estimate noise power at a set of points or bands. In contrast, model-based approaches to spectrum estimation assume additional structure in the form of the spectrum and leverage this for improved statistical accuracy or other capabilities, such as superresolution. Here, we derive model-based QNS approaches using inspiration from classical signal processing, primarily though the recently developed Schrodinger wave autoregressive moving-average (SchWARMA) formalism for modeling correlated noise. We show, through both simulation and experimental data, how these model-based QNS approaches maintain the statistical and computational benefits of their classical counterparts, resulting in powerful new estimation approaches. Beyond the direct application of these approaches to QNS and quantum sensing, we anticipate that the flexibility of the underlying models will find utility in adaptive feedback control for quantum systems, in analogy with their role in classical adaptive signal processing and control.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, quantum Fourier transform infrared (QFTIR) spectroscopy emerged as an alternative to conventional spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region of the spectrum. By harnessing induced coherence and spectral entanglement, QFTIR offers promising potential for the practical detection of organic gasses. However, little research was conducted to bring QFTIR spectrometers closer to domestic or in-field usage. In this work, we present the first use of a QFTIR spectrometer for open-path detection of multiple interfering organic gases in ambient air. The accurate identification of mixtures of acetone, methanol, and ethanol vapors is demonstrated with a QFTIR spectrometer. We achieved this breakthrough by building a nonlinear Michelson interferometer with 1.7m-long arms to increase the absorption length, coupled with analysis techniques from differential absorption spectroscopy. The evolution of different gasses' concentrations in ambient air was measured through time. These results constitute the first use-case of a QFTIR spectrometer as a detector of organic gasses, and thus represent an important milestone towards the development of such detectors in practical situations.</description>

Abstract: Low-frequency $1/f^\alpha$ charge noise significantly hinders the performance of voltage-controlled spin qubits in quantum dots. Here, we utilize fractional calculus to design voltage control pulses yielding the highest average fidelities for noisy quantum gate operations. We focus specifically on the exponential voltage control of the exchange interaction generating two-spin $\mathrm{SWAP}^k$ gates. When stationary charge noise is the dominant source of gate infidelity, we derive that the optimal exchange pulse is long and weak, with the broad shape of the symmetric beta distribution function with parameter $1-\alpha/2$. The common practice of making exchange pulses fast and high-amplitude still remains beneficial in the case of strongly nonstationary noise dynamics, modeled as fractional Brownian motion. The proposed methods are applicable to the characterization and optimization of quantum gate operations in various voltage-controlled qubit architectures.</description>

Abstract: Scholars of the history and philosophy of science have asked what would decolonized science would look like. This paper develops an answer by interrogating the assumption that observations need to be recorded and communicated using the language of classical physics. Niels Bohr held this assumption even though he recognized the fact that quantum phenomena cannot be analyzed on classical lines. Classical analysis requires the objectification of whatever is being observed so that it can be objectively described. Inherent in this analysis is the intellectual creation of a transcendental verity, a view from nowhere. In contrast, knowledge systems that predate European colonialism make use of the quantum nature of nature without constructing an objective model of it. This paper concludes that uncolonized knowledge systems differ from classical ones in that they are epistemically plural, accepting multiple true observations of the same phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Unifying O(3) Equivariant Neural Networks Design with Tensor-Network Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many learning tasks, including learning potential energy surfaces from ab initio calculations, involve global spatial symmetries and permutational symmetry between atoms or general particles. Equivariant graph neural networks are a standard approach to such problems, with one of the most successful methods employing tensor products between various tensors that transform under the spatial group. However, as the number of different tensors and the complexity of relationships between them increase, maintaining parsimony and equivariance becomes increasingly challenging. In this paper, we propose using fusion diagrams, a technique widely employed in simulating SU($2$)-symmetric quantum many-body problems, to design new equivariant components for equivariant neural networks. This results in a diagrammatic approach to constructing novel neural network architectures. When applied to particles within a given local neighborhood, the resulting components, which we term "fusion blocks," serve as universal approximators of any continuous equivariant function defined in the neighborhood. We incorporate a fusion block into pre-existing equivariant architectures (Cormorant and MACE), leading to improved performance with fewer parameters on a range of challenging chemical problems. Furthermore, we apply group-equivariant neural networks to study non-adiabatic molecular dynamics of stilbene cis-trans isomerization. Our approach, which combines tensor networks with equivariant neural networks, suggests a potentially fruitful direction for designing more expressive equivariant neural networks.</description>

      <title>Nonmesonic Quantum Many-Body Scars in a 1D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the meson excitations (particle-antiparticle bound states) in quantum many-body scars of a 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to a dynamical spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain as a matter field. By introducing a string representation of the physical Hilbert space, we express a scar state $\ket {\Psi_{n,l}}$ as a superposition of all string bases with an identical string number $n$ and a total length $l$. For the small-$l$ scar state $\ket {\Psi_{n,l}}$, the gauge-invariant spin exchange correlation function of the matter field hosts an exponential decay as the distance increases, indicating the existence of stable mesons. However, for large $l$, the correlation function exhibits a power-law decay, signaling the emergence of nonmesonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that this mesonic-nonmesonic crossover can be detected by the quench dynamics, starting from two low-entangled initial states, respectively, which are experimentally feasible in quantum simulators. Our results expand the physics of quantum many-body scars in lattice gauge theories and reveal that the nonmesonic state can also manifest ergodicity breaking.</description>

Abstract: We study open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. We identify broad classes of many-body models that support explicitly known eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperators (Lindbladians) $\mathcal L$. The expectation value of the observables defined by these operators exhibits a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Generically, the Lindbladians under study are nonintegrable; in such cases operators $Q$ are similar to special eigenstates in closed many-body systems known as quantum many-body scars. We make this analogy precise by employing the duality between open systems and closed systems with doubled degrees of freedom. Under this duality, operator scars in open systems map to recently discovered Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) scars in closed bilayer systems. Furthermore, we show that there is a family of such dualities which allows one to obtain EPR-like scars with a prescribed entanglement between layers. This opens a novel perspective on EPR scars in closed bilayer systems that clarifies known facts and facilitates new developments.</description>

Abstract: An increasingly large variety of molecular species are being cooled down to low energies in recent years, and innovative ideas and powerful techniques continue to emerge to gain ever more precise control of molecular motion. In this brief review we focus our discussions on two widely employed cooling techniques that have brought molecular gases into the quantum regime: association of ultracold atomic gases into quantum gases of molecules and direct laser cooling of molecules. These advances have brought into reality our capability to prepare and manipulate both internal and external states of molecules quantum mechanically, opening the field of cold molecules to a wide range of scientific explorations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a consistent thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental progress in atomic, molecular, and optical platforms in the last decade has stimulated strong and broad interest in the quantum coherent dynamics of many long-range interacting particles. The prominent collective character of these systems enables novel non-equilibrium phenomena with no counterpart in conventional quantum systems with local interactions. Much of the theory work in this area either focussed on the impact of variable-range interaction tails on the physics of local interactions or relied on mean-field-like descriptions based on the opposite limit of all-to-all infinite-range interactions. In this Report, we present a systematic and organic review of recent advances in the field. Working with prototypical interacting quantum spin lattices without disorder, our presentation hinges upon a versatile theoretical formalism that interpolates between the few-body mean-field physics and the many-body physics of quasi-local interactions. Such a formalism allows us to connect these two regimes, providing both a formal quantitative tool and basic physical intuition. We leverage this unifying framework to review several findings of the last decade, including the peculiar non-ballistic spreading of quantum correlations, counter-intuitive slowdown of entanglement dynamics, suppression of thermalization and equilibration, anomalous scaling of defects upon traversing criticality, dynamical phase transitions, and genuinely non-equilibrium phases stabilized by periodic driving. The style of this Report is on the pedagogical side, which makes it accessible to readers without previous experience in the subject matter.</description>

      <title>Integrability as an attractor of adiabatic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09745v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum chaos and integrability has been extensively studied in the past decades. We approach this topic from the point of view of geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other, integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those parallel to integrability, and the anisotropy between them diverges in the thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. We also provide evidence that the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is universal for both models, similar to continuous phase transitions, and that the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity will be more and more essential in high-energy physics. It is naturally extended into the very early universe. Considering the universe as a quantum chaotic system, the curvature perturbation of the scalar field is identified with the two-mode squeezed state. By solving the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation, one can obtain the numerical solutions of the angle parameter and squeezing parameter. The solution of the squeezing parameter mainly determines the evolution of complexity. Our numeric indicates that the complexity of the modified dispersion relation will have a non-linear pattern after the horizon exits. Meanwhile, its corresponding Lyapunov index is also larger compared with the standard case. During the inflationary period, the complexity will irregularly oscillate and its scrambling time is also shorter compared with the standard case. Since the modified dispersion relation can be dubbed as the consequences of various frameworks of quantum gravity, it could be applicable to these frameworks. Finally, one can expect the framework of quantum gravity will lead to the fruitful evolution of complexity, which guides us in distinguishing various inflationary models.</description>

      <title>What exactly does Bekenstein bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound posits a maximum entropy for matter with finite energy confined to a spatial region. It is often interpreted as a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored by physical objects. In this work, we test this interpretation by asking whether the Bekenstein bound imposes constraints on a channel's communication capacity, a context in which information can be given a mathematically rigorous and operationally meaningful definition. We study specifically the \emph{Unruh channel} that describes a stationary Alice exciting different species of free scalar fields to send information to an accelerating Bob, who is confined to a Rindler wedge and exposed to the noise of Unruh radiation. We show that the classical and quantum capacities of the Unruh channel obey the Bekenstein bound that pertains to the decoder Bob. In contrast, even at high temperatures, the Unruh channel can transmit a significant number of \emph{zero-bits}, which are quantum communication resources that can be used for quantum identification and many other primitive protocols. Therefore, unlike classical bits and qubits, zero-bits and their associated information processing capability are generally not constrained by the Bekenstein bound. However, we further show that when both the encoder and the decoder are restricted, the Bekenstein bound does constrain the channel capacities, including the zero-bit capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobility edge (ME), representing the critical energy that distinguishes between extended and localized states, is a key concept in understanding the transition between extended (metallic) and localized (insulating) states in disordered and quasiperiodic systems. Here we explore the impact of dissipation on a quasiperiodic system featuring MEs by calculating steady-state density matrix and analyzing quench dynamics with sudden introduction of dissipation, and demonstrate that dissipation can lead the system into specific states predominantly characterized by either extended or localized states, irrespective of the initial state. Our results establish the use of dissipation as a new avenue for inducing transitions between extended and localized states, and for manipulating dynamic behaviors of particles.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement constitutes one of the key concepts in quantum mechanics and serves as an indispensable tool in the understanding of quantum many-body systems. In this work, we perform extensive numerical investigations of extensive entanglement properties of coupled quantum spin chains. This setup has proven useful for e.g. extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to open systems, and contrasts the majority of previous research where the entanglement cut has one lower dimension than the system. We focus on the cases where the entanglement Hamiltonian is either gapless or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking behavior. We further employ conformal field theoretical formulae to identify the universal behavior in the former case. The results in our work can serve as a paradigmatic starting point for more systematic exploration of the largely uncharted physics of extensive entanglement, both analytical and numerical.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model model.</description>

      <title>A Christmas Story about Quantum Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a concept that fascinates and confuses many people, in particular, given that it combines quantum physics and the concept of teleportation. With quantum teleportation likely to play a key role in several communication technologies and the quantum internet in the future, it is imperative to create learning tools and approaches that can accurately and effectively communicate the concept. Recent research has indicated the importance of teachers enthusing students about the topic of quantum physics. Therefore, educators at both high school and early university level need to find engaging and perhaps unorthodox ways of teaching complex, yet interesting topics such as quantum teleportation. In this paper, we present a paradigm to teach the concept of quantum teleportation using the Christmas gift-bringer Santa Claus. Using the example of Santa Claus, we use an unusual context to explore the key aspects of quantum teleportation, and all without being overly abstract. In addition, we outline a worksheet designed for use in the classroom setting which is based on common naive conceptions from quantum physics. This worksheet will be evaluated as a classroom resource to teach quantum teleportation in a subsequent study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain-specific hardware to solve computationally hard optimization problems has generated tremendous excitement recently. Here, we evaluate probabilistic bit (p-bit) based on Ising Machines (IM) or p-computers with a benchmark combinatorial optimization problem, namely the 3-regular 3-XOR Satisfiability (3R3X). The 3R3X problem has a glassy energy landscape, and it has recently been used to benchmark various IMs and other solvers. We introduce a multiplexed architecture where p-computers emulate all-to-all (complete) graph functionality despite being interconnected in sparse networks, enabling a highly parallelized chromatic Gibbs sampling. We implement this architecture in FPGAs and show that p-bit networks running an adaptive version of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm demonstrate competitive algorithmic and prefactor advantages over alternative IMs by D-Wave, Toshiba, and Fujitsu, except a greedy algorithm accelerated on a GPU. We further extend our APT results using higher-order interactions in FPGAs and show that while higher-order interactions lead to prefactor advantages, they do not show any algorithmic scaling advantages for the XORSAT problem, settling an open conjecture. Even though FPGA implementations of p-bits are still not quite as fast as the best possible greedy algorithms implemented in GPUs, scaled magnetic versions of p-computers could lead to orders of magnitude over such algorithms according to experimentally established projections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16227v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems, by considering a quasiprobability distribution of work. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a detailed fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have systematically investigated the Krylov complexity of curvature perturbation for the modified dispersion relation in inflation, using the algorithm in closed system and open system. Our analysis could be applied to the most inflationary models. Following the Lanczos algorithm, we find the very early universe is an infinite, many-body, and maximal chaotic system. Our numerics shows that the Lanczos coefficient and Lyapunov index of the standard dispersion relation are mainly determined by the scale factor. As for the modified case, it is nearly determined by the momentum. In a method of the closed system, we discover that the Krylov complexity will show irregular oscillation before the horizon exits. The modified case will present faster growth after the horizon exists. Since the whole universe is an open system, the approach of an open system is more realistic and reliable. Then, we construct the exact wave function which is very robust only requiring the Lanczos coefficient proportional to $n$ (main quantum number). Based on it, we find the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover in the case of a closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, in which our analysis shows that the evolution of Krylov complexity will not be the same with the original situation. We also find the inflationary period is a strong dissipative system. Meanwhile, our numerics clearly shows the Krylov complexity will grow during the whole inflationary period. But for the small scales, there will be a peak after the horizon exits. Our analysis reveals that the dramatic change in background (inflation) will significantly impact the evolution of Krylov complexity. Since the curvature perturbation will transit from the quantum level to the classical level.</description>

      <title>Bound impurities in a one-dimensional Bose lattice gas: low-energy properties and quench-induced dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two mobile bosonic impurities immersed in a one-dimensional optical lattice and interacting with a bosonic bath. We employ the exact diagonalization method for small periodic lattices to study stationary properties and dynamics. We consider the branch of repulsive interactions that induce the formation of bound impurities, akin to the bipolaron problem. A comprehensive study of ground-state and low-energy properties is presented, including an examination of the interaction strengths which induce the formation of a bound dimer of impurities. We also study the dynamics induced after an interaction quench to examine the stability of the bound dimers. We reveal that after large interaction quenches from strong to weak interactions the system can show large oscillations over time with revivals of the dimer states. We find that the oscillations are driven by selected eigenstates with phase-separated configurations.</description>

Abstract: Hyperpolarized nuclear spins in molecules exhibit high magnetization that is unachievable by classical polarization techniques, making them widely used as sensors in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The state of a hyperpolarized material, however, is typically only studied indirectly and with partial destruction of magnetization, due to the nature of conventional detection by resonant-pickup nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or imaging. Here we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an use an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at \si{\micro\tesla}-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization back-action effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven $^{13}$C hyperpolarization of [1--$^{13}$C]-pyruvate -- the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. Our approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.</description>

      <title>Reweight-annealing method for calculating the value of partition function via quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we theoretically develop and experimentally demonstrate a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase shift of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. Experimentally, we image a sparse lattice of $^{87}$Rb samples on the D2 line, to resolve their axial positions with micrometer precision, and to retrieve their complex-valued spectroscopic images. With the phase-angle readouts that are highly insensitive to atom-number and interaction-strength uncertainties, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot-resolution to the transition frequency with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate 3D sensing of local light shift with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>
