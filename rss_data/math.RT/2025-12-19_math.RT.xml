      <title>On the theory of $q$-characters for quantum affine superalgebras of type $A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of $q$-characters for quantum affine superalgebras of type $A$ in connection with deformed Cartan matrices. To achieve this, we establish a Khoroshkin-Tolstoy-type multiplicative formula of the universal $R$-matrix of the associated generalized quantum group, from which one can read off a 2-parameter deformation of Cartan matrices of super type $A$. We also propose a Frenkel-Mukhin-type algorithm for $q$-characters of finite-dimensional simple modules with integral highest $\ell$-weights.</description>

      <title>Weakly Gorensteinness of tensor algebras and Morita algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebra $A$ is left weakly Gorenstein if any semi-Gorenstein-projective left $A$-modules is Gorenstein-projective. The weakly Gorensteinness of two kinds of algebras are answered. Using the method of the monomorphism category, it is proved that the tensor algebra $A\otimes B$ with ${\rm gl.dim} B&lt; \infty$ is left weakly Gorenstein if and only if so is $A$. For a class of Morita algebras $\Lambda=\begin{pmatrix}\begin{smallmatrix} A &amp; N \\ M &amp; B \\ \end{smallmatrix}\end{pmatrix}$, the (semi-)Gorenstein-projective left $\Lambda$-modules are computed and described; and then it is proved that $\Lambda$ is left weakly Gorenstein if and only if so are $A$ and $B$. As an application, the upper triangular matrix algebra $T_n(A)$ is left weakly Gorenstein if and only if so is $A$.</description>

      <title>Categorification of generic Su-Zhang character formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For semisimple Lie algebras, the BGG resolution is commonly interpreted as a categorification of the Weyl character formula. For general linear Lie superalgebras, the Kac--Wakimoto character formula is regarded as a good character formula for a certain class of ``singular'' weights (the so-called Kac--Wakimoto weights). However, the combinatorial factor $\frac{1}{\operatorname{atyp}(\lambda)!}$ makes a direct BGG-type categorification of this formula rather elusive.
  In this paper we construct, for a certain class of ``generic'' weights, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula of the same flavour as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from taking images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules corresponding to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras via odd reflections.
  Note that, while the infinite resolution of Kac--Wakimoto simple modules by Kac modules constructed by Brundan--Stroppel~\cite{brundan2010highestII} does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution, the construction developed here does.</description>

      <title>Classification of real modules in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conjectural formula for the highest $\ell$-weight monomial of an arbitrary real module over a simply-laced quantum affine algebra. We verify the conjecture under a multiplicative reachability condition, answering the Hernandez--Leclerc classification problem in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras under this condition. Moreover, we introduce the notion of cluster modules, generalizing Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and Hernandez--Leclerc modules as special cases. We prove that cluster modules are reachable real modules, and obtain a system of equations governing $q$-characters of the prime cluster modules, providing a natural generalization of both the classical T-system relations for Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and the exchange relations for Hernandez--Leclerc modules.</description>

      <title>On finitude of the number of isomorphism classes in the category NT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The category $\bcalNT$ was defined in \cite{Lobos2}, it is a category whose objects are commutative nil graded algebras over a field, defined by presentation encoded by triangular matrices. A natural problem related to this category is to reach a complete classification up to isomorphism of its objects. Based in some results coming from \cite{Lobos2}, we can divide this problem by working with encoding matrices of a fixed size $n.$ In \cite{Lobos3} and \cite{Lobos4}, there are several advances for this search, in particular, in \cite{Lobos3} one can see that, for small matrices, the number of isomorphism classes seems to be finite and independent on the ground field. That fact, opened a series of questions related with the number of isomorphism classes and its relation with the ground field. At that point it was no clear, under which conditions of the ground field, this number could be finite. In this article, among other results, we prove that for each $n\geq4,$ the number of isomorphism classes is finite if and only if the ground field is finite.</description>

      <title>Extriangulated structures from stability conditions and application to braid representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the notion of Bridgeland stability condition and its associated metric to endow triangulated categories with extriangulated structures and study their extriangulated Grothendieck groups. This study is motivated by Khovanov-Seidel's categorification of the Burau representation, from which can be extracted the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation, providing a relation between these two faithful representations of the braid groups.</description>

      <title>Deformations of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the A$_\infty$ deformation theory of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of graded surfaces. We show that any abstract A$_\infty$ deformation is "geometric", namely it is equivalent to the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface obtained as a partial compactification of the original surface. For certain genus 0 surfaces, these deformations are generically Fukaya categories of compact pillowcases.
  We introduce the notion of a weak dual and use unbounded twisted complexes to overcome the curvature problem that naturally arises when some of the boundary components are fully wrapped.
  Our results provide a first account of the relationship between A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya categories and partial compactifications, as advocated in P. Seidel's ICM 2002 address, in the presence of stop data. All of our results also hold when the original surface has finitely many order 2 orbifold points.</description>

      <title>L-equivalences via Symplectic and $F_4$ Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a construction of Kanemitsu from [9] and observations by Rampazzo in [19], we find examples of zero divisors in the Grothendieck ring of varieties by taking the zero loci of sections of vector bundles over symplectic and $F_4$ Grassmannians. These zero divisors yield instances of non-trivially L-equivalent Calabi-Yau varieties. This methodology is inspired by a similar process performed by Ito et al. on $G_2$ Grassmannians in [8].</description>

Abstract: In this article, we use Pl\"ucker relations in the Grassmannian $Gr(3,n)$ to give relations that hold amongst some of the entries of the Heronian frieze of order $n$. Furthermore, we make a connection between certain subfriezes of a Heronian frieze and Pl\"ucker friezes $P(3,n)$, and then show that some determinants of the matrices whose elements lie in those subfriezes are vanishing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we initiate the study of quivers satisfying quantum Yang-Baxter equation. By considering quivers with quantum group like relations such as quantum Yang-Baxter equation, Hecke condition, we follow RTT construction to produce examples of Leavitt path algebras that contain quantum matrix algebra as subalgebra. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers.</description>

Abstract: Thanks to the work of Karin Erdmann, we know a great deal about the representation theory of blocks of finite groups with tame representation type. Our purpose here is to examine the $p$-completed classifying spaces of these blocks and their loop spaces. We pay special attention to the $A_\infty$ algebra structures, and singularity and cosingularity categories.</description>

      <title>Brick chain filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the category of finitely generated modules over an artin algebra $A$. Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way.
  In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use.
  This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $\tau$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $\tau$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau$).</description>

Abstract: In Finite Group Modular Representation Theory, the basic objects are the indecomposable and simple modules. This paper offers a new classification of these objects that refines the Green Theory Classification of indecomposable and simple modules. The sets of isomorphism tyes of these modules is decomposed into disjoint, non-empty subsets such that any two elements in any subset share Green Theory Invariants. We also prove a new formula for the number of isomorphism types of absolutely simple modules of finite groups in prime characteristic.</description>

      <title>Classification of coadjoint orbits for the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple group of type F_4</title>

Abstract: Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple algebraic group of type {\Phi}. It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this action is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method of A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of {\Phi} = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms will be explicitly described in terms of supports.</description>

      <title>Skew hook Schur functions and the cyclic sieving phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix an integer $t \geq 2$ and a primitive $t^{\text{th}}$ root of unity $\omega$. We consider the specialized skew hook Schur polynomial $\text{hs}_{\lambda/\mu}(X,\omega X,\dots,\omega^{t-1}X/Y,\omega Y,\dots,\omega^{t-1}Y)$, where $\omega^k X=(\omega^k x_1, \dots, \omega^k x_n)$, $\omega^k Y=(\omega^k y_1, \dots, \omega^k y_m)$ for $0 \leq k \leq t-1$. We characterize the skew shapes $\lambda/\mu$ for which the polynomial vanishes and prove that the nonzero polynomial factorizes into smaller skew hook Schur polynomials. Then we give a combinatorial interpretation of $\text{hs}_{\lambda/\mu}(1,\omega^d,\dots,\omega^{d(tn-1)}/1,\omega^d,\dots,\omega^{d(tm-1)})$, for all divisors $d$ of $t$, in terms of ribbon supertableaux. Lastly, we use the combinatorial interpretation to prove the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of semistandard supertableaux of shape $\lambda/\mu$ for odd $t$. Using a similar proof strategy, we give a complete generalization of a result of Lee--Oh (arXiv: 2112.12394, 2021) for the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of skew SSYT conjectured by Alexandersson--Pfannerer--Rubey--Uhlin (Forum Math. Sigma, 2021).</description>

      <title>On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being right perfect as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Grounded partitions of type $A_1^{(1)}$ at levels 1 and 2: bijections, affine crystal graphs, and partition identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan, are coloured partitions satisfying difference conditions given by a matrix with nonnegative integer entries. For the matrices studied in this paper, the generating functions are known to be infinite products, corresponding to the principal specialisation of characters of highest weight modules of type $A_1^{(1)}$. We give the first bijective proof that the generating functions of grounded partitions at level $2$ are infinite products. We then give a new combinatorial model for affine crystal graphs of type $A_1^{(1)}$ at level $2$, where the vertices are grounded partitions and the arrows are given by explicit bracketing rules. The grounded partition model for affine crystal graphs of highest weights $\Lambda_0$, $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_1$ gives rise to new $q$-series identities obtained by decomposing the affine crystal graphs into the crystal graphs of finite type $A_1$ via the restricted representation.</description>

Abstract: Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems and was one of the primary motivations for the creation of cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through two operations preserving Zamolodchikov periodicity, folding and taking transpose. Our work holds connections to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory, and our main theorem helps classify all nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups, $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$.</description>

      <title>The $\rho$-Schwartz space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive group over a local field $F$ and let $\rho:{}^LG \to \mathrm{GL}_{V_{\rho}}(\mathbb{C})$ be a representation of its $L$-group satisfying suitable assumptions. Braverman, Kazhdan and Ng\^o conjectured that one has a Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}_{\rho}(G(F))$ of functions on $G(F)$ that admits a Fourier transform and satisfies certain desiderata. We prove a large portion of this conjecture. More precisely, we construct these Schwartz spaces over non-Archimedean local fields and construct an approximation to them over Archimedean fields. Our methods are spectral in nature.</description>
