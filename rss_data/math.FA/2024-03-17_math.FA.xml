      <title>Boundedness of composition operator in Orlicz-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate necessary and sufficient conditions on the boundedness of composition operators on the Orlicz-Morrey spaces. The results of boundedness include Lebesgue and generalized Morrey spaces as special cases. Further, we characterize the boundedness of composition operators on the weak Orlicz-Morrey spaces. The weak Orlicz-Morrey spaces contain the Orlicz-Morrey spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the theories of Kaplansky-Hilbert modules and probability theory in vector lattices, we generalise functional analysis by replacing the scalars $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ by a real or complex Dedekind complete unital $f$-algebra $\mathbb{L}$; such an algebra can be represented as a suitable space of continuous functions. We set up the basic theory of $\mathbb{L}$-normed and $\mathbb{L}$-Banach spaces and bounded operators between them, we discuss the $\mathbb{L}$-valued analogues of the classical $\ell^p$-spaces, and we prove the analogue of the Hahn-Banach theorem. We also discuss the basics of the theory of $\mathbb{L}$-Hilbert spaces, including projections onto convex subsets and the Riesz Representation theorem.</description>

      <title>Proper splittings of Hilbert space operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper splittings of operators are commonly used to study the convergence of iterative processes. In order to approximate solutions of operator equations, in this article we deal with proper splittings of closed range bounded linear operators defined on Hilbert spaces. We study the convergence of general proper splittings of operators in the infinite dimensional context. We also propose some particular splittings for special classes of operators and we study different criteria of convergence and comparison for them. In some cases, these criteria are given under hypothesis of operator order relations. In addition, we relate these results with the concept of the symmetric approximation of a frame in a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Discrete functional inequalities on lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study problems at the interface of analysis and discrete mathematics. We discuss analogues of well known Hardy-type inequalities and Rearrangement inequalities on the lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with a particular focus on behaviour of sharp constants and optimizers.In the first half of the thesis, we analyse Hardy inequalities on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, first for $d=1$ and then for $d \geq 3$. We prove a sharp weighted Hardy inequality on integers with power weights of the form $n^\alpha$. This is done via two different methods, namely super-solution and Fourier method. We also use Fourier method to prove a weighted Hardy type inequality for higher order operators. After discussing the one dimensional case, we study the Hardy inequality in higher dimensions ($d \geq 3$). In particular, we compute the asymptotic behaviour of the sharp constant in the discrete Hardy inequality, as $d \rightarrow \infty$. This is done by converting the inequality into a continuous Hardy-type inequality on a torus for functions having zero average. These continuous inequalities are new and interesting in themselves.
  In the second half, we focus our attention on analogues of Rearrangement inequalities on lattice graphs. We begin by analysing the situation in dimension one. We define various notions of rearrangements and prove the corresponding Polya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. These inequalities are also applied to prove some weighted Hardy inequalities on integers. Finally, we study Rearrangement inequalities (Polya-Szeg\H{o}) on general graphs, with a particular focus on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d \geq 2$. We develop a framework to study these inequalities, using which we derive concrete results in dimension two. In particular, these results develop connections between Polya-Szeg\H{o} inequality and various isoperimetric inequalities on graphs.</description>

      <title>Hunter's positivity theorem and random vector norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem of Hunter ensures that the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials of even degree are positive definite functions. A probabilistic interpretation of Hunter's theorem suggests a broad generalization: the construction of so-called random vector norms on square complex matrices. This paper surveys these ideas, starting from the fundamental notions and developing the theory to its present state. We study numerous examples and present a host of open problems.</description>

      <title>On the product of periodic distributions. Product in shift-invariant spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect through the Fourier transform shift-invariant Sobolev type spaces $V_s\subset H^s$, $s\in\mathbb R,$ and the spaces of periodic distributions and analyze the properties of elements in such spaces with respect to the product. If the series expansions of two periodic distributions have compatible coefficient estimates, then their product is a periodic tempered distribution. We connect product of tempered distributions with the product of shift-invariant elements of $V_s$. The idea for the analysis of products comes from the H\"ormander's description of the Sobolev type wave front in connection with the product of distributions. Coefficient compatibility for the product of $f$ and $g$ in the case of "good" position of their Sobolev type wave fronts is proved in the 2-dimensional case. For larger dimension it is an open problem because of the difficulties on the description of the intersection of cones in dimension $d\geqslant3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain boundedness properties of modified averaging operators, showing that on geometrically doubling spaces superaveraging operators are always $L^1$-bounded (but not necessarily $L^p$-bounded for $p &gt; 1$). In turn, the $L^1$ boundedness of the superaveraging operators for any $t &gt; 1$, entails that the space is geometrically doubling.</description>

      <title>On the frame property of Hermite functions and analytic extensions of their frame sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Gabor frames with Hermite window functions. Gr\"ochenig and Lyubarskii provided a sufficient density condition for their frame sets, which leads to what we call the ``safety region". For rectangular lattices and Hermite windows of order 4 and higher, we enlarge this safety region by providing new points on the boundary of this region. For this purpose, we employ the Janssen representation of the frame operator to compare its distance to the identity in the operator norm. The calculations lead to estimates on series involving Laguerre polynomials with Gaussian weight functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove characterizations of the discrete Besov spaces in terms of the heat and Poisson semigroups associated with the discrete Laplacian that will allow us to prove regularity results for the fractional powers of the discrete Laplacian and the discrete Bessel potentials. Moreover, we provide new estimates for the derivatives of the discrete heat kernel and semigroup which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on smooth mappings of Hilbert and Banach spaces and their local convexity property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.15175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze smooth nonlinear mappings for Hilbert and Banach spaces that carry small balls to convex sets, provided that the radius of the balls is small enough. Being focused on the study of new and mild sufficient conditions for a nonlinear mapping of Hilbert and Banach spaces to be locally convex, we address a suitably reformulated local convexity problem analyzed within the Leray-Schauder homotopy method approach for Hilbert spaces, and within the Lipscitz smoothness condition both for Hilbert and Banach spaces. Some of the results presented in the work prove to be interesting and novel even for finite-dimensional problems. Open problems related to the local convexity property for nonlinear mapping of Banach spaces are also formulated.</description>

      <title>On Better Approximation Order for the Nonlinear Meyer-K\"onig and Zeller Operator of Maximum Product Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using maximum instead of sum, nonlinear Meyer-K\"onig and Zeller operator of maximum product kind is introduced by Bede et al. The present paper deals with the approximation processes for this operator. Especially in, it was indicated that the order of approximation of this operator to the function f under the modulus is and it could not be improved except for some subclasses of functions. Contrary to this claim, we will show that a better order of approximation can be obtained with the help of classical modulus of continuity.</description>

      <title>Kernel theorems for operators on co-orbit spaces associated with localised frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel theorems, in general, provide a convenient representation of bounded linear operators. For the operator acting on a concrete function space, this means that its action on any element of the space can be expressed as a generalised integral operator, in a way reminiscent of the matrix representation of linear operators acting on finite dimensional vector spaces. We prove kernel theorems for bounded linear operators acting on co-orbit spaces associated with localised frames. Our two main results consist in characterising the spaces of operators whose generalised integral kernels belong to the co-orbit spaces of test functions and distributions associated with the tensor product of the localised frames respectively. Moreover, using a version of Schur's test, we establish a characterisation of the bounded linear operators between some specific co-orbit spaces.</description>

      <title>Conditional plasticity of the unit ball of the $\ell_\infty$-sum of finitely many strictly convex Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any $\ell_\infty$-sum $Z = \bigoplus_{i \in [n]} X_i$ of finitely many strictly convex Banach spaces $(X_i)_{i \in [n]}$, an extremeness preserving 1-Lipschitz bijection $f\colon B_Z \to B_Z$ is an isometry, by constraining the componentwise behavior of the inverse $g=f^{-1}$ with a theorem admitting a graph-theoretic interpretation. We also show that if $X, Y$ are Banach spaces, then a bijective 1-Lipschitz non-isometry of type $B_X \to B_Y$ can be used to construct a bijective 1-Lipschitz non-isometry of type $B_{X'} \to B_{X'}$ for some Banach space $X'$, and that a homeomorphic 1-Lipschitz non-isometry of type $B_X \to B_X$ restricts to a homeomorphic 1-Lipschitz non-isometry of type $B_S \to B_S$ for some separable subspace $S \leq X$.</description>

      <title>de Leeuw representations of functionals on Lipschitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M)$ be the space of Lipschitz functions on a complete metric space $(M,d)$ that vanish at a point $0\in M$. We investigate its dual $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M)^*$ using the de Leeuw transform, which allows representing each functional on $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M)$ as a (non-unique) measure on $\beta\widetilde{M}$, where $\widetilde{M}$ is the space of pairs $(x,y)\in M\times M$, $x\neq y$. We distinguish a set of points of $\beta\widetilde{M}$ that are "away from infinity", which can be assigned coordinates belonging to the Lipschitz realcompactification $M^{\mathcal{R}}$ of $M$. We define a natural metric $\bar{d}$ on $M^{\mathcal{R}}$ extending $d$ and we show that optimal (i.e. positive and norm-minimal) de Leeuw representations of well-behaved functionals are characterised by $\bar{d}$-cyclical monotonicity of their support, extending known results for functionals in $\mathcal{F}(M)$, the predual of $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M)$. We also extend the Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem to normal Hausdorff spaces, in particular to $M^{\mathcal{R}}$, and use this to characterise measure-induced and majorisable functionals in $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M)^*$ as those admitting optimal representations with additional finiteness properties. Finally, we use de Leeuw representations to define a natural L-projection of $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M)^*$ onto $\mathcal{F}(M)$ under some conditions on $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03733v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise all pairs of finite order entire functions whose magnitudes agree on two arbitrary lines in the complex plane by means of the Hadamard factorisation theorem. Building on this, we also characterise all pairs of second order entire functions whose magnitudes agree on infinitely many equidistant parallel lines. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of an entire function on three parallel lines, whose distances are rationally independent, uniquely determines the function up to global phase, and that there exists a first order entire function whose magnitude on the lines $\mathbb{R} + \tfrac{\mathrm{i}}{n} \mathbb{Z}$ does not uniquely determine it up to global phase, for all positive integers $n$. Our results have direct implications for Gabor phase retrieval.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in the theory of metric measures spaces on the one hand, and of sub-Riemannian ones on the other hand, suggest the possibility of a "great unification" of Riemannian and sub-Riemannian geometries in a comprehensive framework of synthetic Ricci curvature lower bounds. With the aim of achieving such a unification program, in this paper we initiate the study of gauge metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Curvature bound of Dyson Brownian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00262v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a differential structure associated with the infinite particle Dyson Brownian motion satisfies the Bakry-\'Emery nonnegative lower Ricci curvature bound $\mathsf{BE}(0, \infty)$. Various functional inequalities follow including a local spectral gap inequality, the Lipschitz Feller property, the dimension-free Harnack inequality and the evolutional variation inequality. As a consequence, the infinite Dyson Brownian motion is characterised as a gradient flow of the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy associated with $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$ point processes with respect to a certain Benamou-Brenier-like Wasserstein distance. At the end, we provide a sufficient condition for $\mathsf{BE}(K, \infty)$ beyond the Dyson model and apply it to the infinite particle model of the $\beta$-Riesz gas.</description>

      <title>Thermal time as an unsharp observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Connes-Rovelli thermal time associated with the quantum harmonic oscillator can be described as an (unsharp) observable, that is, as a positive operator valued measure. We furthermore present extensions of this result to the free massless relativistic particle in one dimension and to a hypothetical physical system whose equilibrium state is given by the noncommutative integral.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Neural Networks for Indirect Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great success in various tasks related to inverse problems, where a target quantity of interest can only be observed through indirect measurements by a forward operator. Common approaches apply deep neural networks in a post-processing step to the reconstructions obtained by classical reconstruction methods. However, the latter methods can be computationally expensive and introduce artifacts that are not present in the measured data and, in turn, can deteriorate the performance on the given task. To overcome these limitations, we propose a class of equivariant neural networks that can be directly applied to the measurements to solve the desired task. To this end, we build appropriate network structures by developing layers that are equivariant with respect to data transformations induced by well-known symmetries in the domain of the forward operator. We rigorously analyze the relation between the measurement operator and the resulting group representations and prove a representer theorem that characterizes the class of linear operators that translate between a given pair of group actions. Based on this theory, we extend the existing concepts of Lie group equivariant deep learning to inverse problems and introduce new representations that result from the involved measurement operations. This allows us to efficiently solve classification, regression or even reconstruction tasks based on indirect measurements also for very sparse data problems, where a classical reconstruction-based approach may be hard or even impossible. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in numerical experiments and compare with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Schauder frames of discrete translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $p &gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ we construct a uniformly discrete real sequence $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ with $|\lambda_{n+1}| &gt; |\lambda_n|$, a function $g \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$, and continuous linear functionals $\{g^*_n\}$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, such that every $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ admits a series expansion \[ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} g_n^*(f) g(x-\lambda_n) \] convergent in the $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ norm. We also prove a similar result for the space $C_0(\mathbb{R})$, where in this case $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is taken to be the sequence of positive integers.</description>
