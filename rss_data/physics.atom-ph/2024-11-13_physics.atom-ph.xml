      <title>Correlated Rydberg Electromagnetically Induced Transparencys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the regime of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, we study the correlated behaviors between the transmission spectra of a pair of probe fields passing through respective parallel one-dimensional cold Rydberg ensembles. Due to the van der Waals (vdW) interactions between Rydberg atoms, each ensemble exhibits a local optical nonlinearity, where the output EIT spectra are sensitive to both the input probe intensity and the photonic statistics. More interestingly, a nonlocal optical nonlinearity emerges between two spatially separated ensembles, as the probe transmissivity and probe correlation at the exit of one Rydberg ensemble can be manipulated by the probe field at the input of the other Rydberg ensemble. Realizing correlated Rydberg EITs holds great potential for applications in quantum control, quantum network, quantum walk and so on.</description>

      <title>Polarizabilities as Probes for P, T, and PT Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for violations of the fundamental symmetries of parity P and time reversal T in atomic and molecular systems provide a powerful tool for precise measurements of the physics of and beyond the standard model. In this work, we investigate how these symmetry violations affect the response of atoms and molecules to applied electric and magnetic fields. We recover well-known observables such as the P-odd, T-odd spin-electric field coupling that is used for searches of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) or the effect of P-odd, T-even optical rotation in atomic gases. Besides these, we obtain several other possible observables. This includes, in particular, effects that can only be seen when using oscillating or inhomogeneous fields.</description>

      <title>Simulated optical molasses cooling of trapped antihydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the cooling of antihydrogen, $\bar{H}$, using optical molasses cooling. This updates the results in Ref. [1] to the current capabilities of the ALPHA experiment. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we show that $\bar{H}$s do not give the standard cooling even in an ideal optical molasses because of their small mass and large transition frequency. For optical molasses cooling in the ALPHA trap, the photons are constrained to travel in one direction only. It is only through the phase space mixing in the trap that cooling in all directions can be achieved. We explore the nontrivial role that laser intensity plays in the cooling. We also investigate the possibility for simultaneously cooling atoms in either of the trapped ground states.</description>

      <title>On matrix elements of the vector physical quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods of angular momenta are modified and used to solve some actual problems in quantum mechanics. In particular, we re-derive some known formulas for analytical and numerical calculations of matrix elements of the vector physical quantities. These formulas are applied to a large number of quantum systems which have an explicit spherical symmetry. Multiple commutators of different powers of the angular momenta $\hat{\bf J}^{2}$ and vector-operator $\hat{\bf A}$ are determined in the general form. Calculations of the expectation values averaged over orbital angular momenta are also described in detail. This effective and elegant old technique, which was successfully used by E. Fermi and A. Bohr, is almost forgotten in modern times. We also discuss quantum systems with additional relations (or constraints) between some vector-operators and orbital angular momentum. For similar systems such relations allow one to obtain some valuable additional information about their properties, including the bound state spectra, correct asymptotics of actual wave functions, etc. As an example of unsolved problems we consider applications of the algebras of angular momenta to investigation of the one-electron, two-center (Coulomb) problem $(Q_1, Q_2)$. For this problem it is possible to obtain the closed analytical solutions which are written as the `correct' linear combinations of products of the two one-electron wave functions of the hydrogen-like ions with the nuclear charges $Q_1 + Q_2$ and $Q_1 - Q_2$, respectively. However, in contrast with the usual hydrogen-like ions such hydrogenic wave functions must be constructed in three-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space with the metric (-1,-1,1).</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps, facilitating tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>

      <title>An atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer-based acceleration sensor for microgravity environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of an atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) with a pulsed non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) source as a space-based acceleration sensor. We derive an analytic approximation for the device's transmission under a uniform acceleration, which we use to compute the device's attainable acceleration sensitivity using the classical Fisher information. In the ideal case of a high-finesse FPI and an infinitely narrow momentum width atomic source, we find that when the total length of the device is constrained to small values, the atomic FPI can achieve greater acceleration sensitivity than a Mach-Zender (MZ) interferometer of equivalent total device length. Under the more realistic case of a finite momentum width atomic source, We identify the ideal cavity length that gives the best sensitivity. Although the MZ interferometer now offers enhanced sensitivity within currently-achievable experimental parameter regimes, our analysis demonstrates that the atomic FPI holds potential as a promising alternative in the future, provided that narrow momentum width atomic sources can be engineered.</description>

      <title>Coherent Three-Photon Excitation of the Strontium Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent three-photon excitation of the strontium clock transition with a contrast of 51(12)% using a Bose-Einstein condensate. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer, overcoming the typical limitations of this technique to odd-level numbers. We also measure the two-body loss coefficient of $^{84}$Sr clock-state atoms. Our work constitutes an essential step towards outcoupling a continuous atom laser beam and provides a fast excitation mechanism for quantum simulation using bosonic alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant differences are around $30 \ \%$ for Ar and $80 \ \%$ for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The transition is dominated from the $3p$ shell electrons for Ar. For Xe, $5p$ states dominate the contribution, but, $4d$ states give $\sim 40\ \%$ contribution at 1 keV. The differences for Xe atom will become better for high energy because of the approximation and lack of data.</description>
