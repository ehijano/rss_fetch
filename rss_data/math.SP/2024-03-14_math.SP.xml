      <title>Large Steklov eigenvalues under volume constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we establish an expression for the Steklov spectrum of warped products in terms of auxiliary Steklov problems for drift Laplacians with weight induced by the warping factor. As an application, we show that a compact manifold with connected boundary diffeomorphic to a product admits a family of Riemannian metrics which coincide on the boundary, have fixed volume and arbitrarily large first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue. These are the first examples of Riemannian metrics with these properties on three-dimensional manifolds.</description>

      <title>Vertex coupling interpolation in quantum chain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze band spectrum of the periodic quantum graph in the form of a chain of rings connected by line segments with the vertex coupling which violates the time reversal invariance, interpolating between the $\delta$ coupling and the one determined by a simple circulant matrix. We find that flat bands are generically absent and that the negative spectrum is nonempty even for interpolation with a non-attractive $\delta$ coupling; we also determine the high-energy asymptotic behavior of the bands.</description>

      <title>Spectral structure of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator on axially symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator on a three-dimensional axially symmetric domain which is generated by rotating a planar domain around an axis which does not intersect the planar domain. We investigate its spectral structure when it is restricted to axially symmetric functions. If the boundary of the domain is smooth, we show that there are infinitely many axially symmetric eigenfunctions and derive Weyl-type asymptotics of the corresponding eigenvalues. We also derive the leading order terms of the asymptotic limits of positive and negative eigenvalues. The coefficients of the leading order terms are related to the convexity and concavity of the domain. If the boundary of the domain is less regular, we derive decay estimates of the eigenvalues. The decay rate depends on the regularity of the boundary. We also consider the domains with corners and prove that the essential spectrum of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator on the axially symmetric three-dimensional domain is non-trivial and contains that of the planar domain.</description>

      <title>Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also delve into the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of extended Koopman operator within a framework of rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</description>
