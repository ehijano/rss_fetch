      <title>Fate of entanglement in quadratic Markovian dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic description for the driven-dissipative dynamics of the entanglement negativity, which quantifies the genuine entanglement in mixed-state systems. We focus on quantum quenches in fermionic and bosonic systems subject to linear dissipation, as described by quadratic Lindblad master equations. In the spirit of hydrodynamics, we divide the system into mesoscopic cells. At early times, correlations are generated in each cell by the unitary component of the evolution. Correlations are then transported across different cells via ballistic quasiparticle propagation, while simultaneously evolving under the action of the environment. We show that in the hydrodynamic limit the negativity can be reconstructed from the correlations between the independently propagating quasiparticles. We benchmark our approach considering quenches from both homogeneous and inhomogeneous initial states in the Kitaev chain, the tight-binding chain, and the harmonic chain in the presence of gain/loss dissipation.</description>

      <title>Programmable order by disorder effect and underlying phases through dipolar quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study two different quantum simulators composed of molecules with dipole-dipole interaction through various theoretical and numerical tools. Our first result provides knowledge upon the quantum order by disorder effect of the $S=1/2$ system, which is programmable in a quantum simulator composed of circular Rydberg atoms in the triangular optical lattice with a controllable diagonal anisotropy. When the numbers of up spins and down spins are equal, a set of sub-extensive degenerate ground states is present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Adopting the the real space perturbation theory, our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring the stripe configuration. When $J$ becomes larger, we adopt the infinite projected entangled-pair state~(iPEPS) and numerically check the effect of degeneracy lifting. The iPEPS results show that even when the spin exchange coupling is strong the stripe pattern is still favored. Next, we study the dipolar bosonic model with tilted polar angle which can be realized through a quantum simulator composed of cold atomic gas with dipole-dipole interaction in an optical lattice. By placing the atoms in a triangular lattice and tilting the polar angle, the diagonal anisotropy can also be realized in the bosonic system. With our cluster mean-field theory calculation, we provide various phase diagrams with different tilted angles, showing the abundant underlying phases including the supersolid. Our proposal indicates realizable scenarios through quantum simulators in studying the quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases. We believe that our results indicated here can also become a good benchmark for the two-dimensional quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Superfluid vortex dynamics with an elliptical boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold-atom platforms have made real-time dynamics accessible, renewing interest in the motion of superfluid vortices in two-dimensional domains. Here we show that the energy and the trajectories of arbitrary vortex configurations may be computed on a complicated (curved or bounded) surface, provided that one knows a conformal map that links the latter to a simpler domain (like the full plane, or a circular boundary). We also prove that Hamilton's equations based on the vortex energy agree with the complex dynamical equations for the vortex dynamics, demonstrating that the vortex trajectories are constant-energy curves. We use these ideas to study the dynamics of vortices in a two-dimensional incompressible superfluid with an elliptical boundary, and we derive an analytical expression for the complex potential describing the hydrodynamic flow throughout the fluid. For a vortex inside an elliptical boundary, the orbits are nearly self-similar ellipses.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Bogoliubov momentum pairing and emergence of non-Gaussian correlations in ultracold interacting Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum matter -- such as interacting electron systems or interacting quantum fluids -- possesses properties that cannot be understood in terms of linear fluctuations and free quasi-particles. Quantum fluctuations in these systems are indeed large and generically exhibit non-Gaussian statistics -- a property captured only by inspecting high-order correlations, whose quantitative reconstruction poses a formidable challenge to both experiments and theory alike. A prime example of correlated quantum matter is the strongly interacting Bose fluid, realized by superfluid Helium and, more recently, ultra-cold atoms. Here, we experimentally study interacting Bose gases from the weakly to the strongly interacting regime through single-atom-resolved correlations in momentum space. We observe that the Bogoliubov pairing among modes of opposite momenta, emblematic of the weakly interacting regime, is suppressed as interactions become stronger. This departure from the predictions of Bogoliubov theory signals the onset of the strongly correlated regime, as confirmed by numerical simulations that highlight the role of non-linear quantum fluctuations in our system. Additionally, our measurements unveil a non-zero four-operator cumulant at even stronger interactions, which is a direct signature of non-Gaussian correlations. These results shed light on the emergence and physical origin of non-Gaussian correlations in ensembles of interacting bosons.</description>

      <title>Coherent Three-Photon Excitation of the Strontium Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently demonstrated a continuous Bose-Einstein condensate of strontium atoms. We could turn this into a continuous-wave atom laser if an efficient outcoupling mechanism is found. Here we show a coherent three-photon excitation of the clock transition in a strontium BEC with contrast of 44.6(3.5)%. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer. Our work constitutes an essential step towards the outcoupling of a continuous atom laser beam and provides a robust excitation mechanism for quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Universal Aspects of High-Temperature Relaxation Dynamics in Random Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universality is a crucial concept in modern physics, allowing us to capture the essential features of a system's behavior using a small set of parameters. In this work, we unveil universal spin relaxation dynamics in anisotropic random Heisenberg models with infinite-range interactions at high temperatures. Starting from a polarized state, the total magnetization can relax monotonically or decay with long-lived oscillations, determined by the sign of a universal single function $A=-\xi_1^2+\xi_2^2-4\xi_2\xi_3+\xi_3^2$. Here $(\xi_1,\xi_3,\xi_3)$ characterizes the anisotropy of the Heisenberg interaction. Furthermore, the oscillation shows up only for $A&gt;0$, with frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{A}$. To validate our theory, we compare it to numerical simulations by solving the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equation with a melon diagram approximation and the exact diagonalization (ED). The results show our theoretical prediction works in both cases, regardless of a small system size $N=8$ in ED simulations. Our study sheds light on the universal aspect of quantum many-body dynamics beyond low energy limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05010v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the low temperature thermodynamic equations corrected by virtual processes for integrable QFT on large but finite size space circle. Obtained TBA's are solved numerically for the sinh-Gordon model. We also derive corresponding Euler scale generalized hydrodynamic (GHD) equations and display them explicitly for small occupation ratio of virtual quasiparticles. The spectrum of velocities for the linear approximation to GHD is numerically calculated.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>
