      <title>Large positive solutions for a class of 1-D diffusive logistic problems with general boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to establish the existence of a positive solution for the singular boundary value problem (1.1), where $\mathcal{B}$ is a general boundary operator of Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin type, either classical or non-classical; in the sense that, as soon as $\mathcal{B}u(0)=-u'(0)+\beta u(0)$, the coefficient $\beta$ can take any real value, not necessarily $\beta\geq 0$ as in the classical Sturm--Liouville theory. Since the function $f(u):=au^p -\lambda u$, $u\geq 0$, is not increasing if $\lambda&gt;0$, the uniqueness of the positive solution of (1.1) is far from obvious, in general, even for the simplest case when $a(x)$ is a positive constant. The second goal of this paper is to establish the uniqueness of the positive solution of (1.1) in that case. At a later stage, denoting by $L_\lambda$ the unique positive solution of (1.1) when $a(x)$ is a positive constant, we will characterize the point-wise behavior of $L_\lambda$ as $\lambda\to \pm \infty$. It turns out that any positive solution of (1.1) mimics the behavior of $L_\lambda$ as $\lambda \to \pm\infty$. Finally, we will establish the uniqueness of the positive solution of (1.1) when $a(x)$ is non-increasing in $[0,R]$, $\lambda\geq 0$, and $\beta&lt;0$ if $-u'(0)+\beta u(0)=0$.</description>

      <title>On the classification of hypergeometric families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several important families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line are called ``hypergeometric'' since they can be explicitly described in terms of some hypergeometric series $_pF_q$ that uses the degree $n$ of the polynomial as a parameter. It is natural to ask if one can classify all such families. Indeed many classification results have been obtained in this direction, but only under the additional assumption that the polynomials are eigenfunctions of some second order operator.
  In this paper we initiate a new approach to this classification. We propose a definition of an HG family that makes precise, but also generalizes, the notion of a ``hypergeometric'' family. Our main result is that there are exactly 10 types of orthogonal HG families, 8 from the well-known Askey scheme and 2 additional types of families that can be expressed in terms of Lommel polynomials.
  Our methods in this paper are algebraic. In particular, we classify a wider class of quasi-orthogonal HG families, and this classification is valid over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. We also define a more general class of rational HG families and prove a structure theorem for quasi-orthogonal families in this class. We provide examples for such families, that are in particular new families of orthogonal polynomials of potential interest.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism theorem for sums of translates on the real axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study sums of translates on the real axis. These functions generalize logarithms of weighted algebraic polynomials. Namely, we are dealing with the following functions \[ F(\mathbf{y},t) := J(t) + \sum \limits_{j=1}^n K_j(t-y_j), \quad \mathbf{y} := (y_1,\ldots,y_n), \ y_1 \le \ldots \le y_n, \] where the field function $J$ is a function defined on $\mathbb{R}$, which is "admissible" for the kernels $K_1,\ldots,K_n$ concave on $(-\infty,0)$ and on $(0,\infty)$ and having a singularity at $0.$ We consider "local maxima" \begin{gather*} \begin{aligned} m_0(\mathbf{y}) &amp; := \sup \limits_{t \in (-\infty, y_1]} F(\mathbf{y}, t), \quad m_n(\mathbf{y}) := \sup \limits_{t \in [y_n, \infty)} F(\mathbf{y}, t),\\ m_j(\mathbf{y}) &amp; := \sup \limits_{t \in [y_j, y_{j+1}]} F(\mathbf{y}, t), \quad j = 1,\ldots,n-1, \end{aligned} \end{gather*} and the difference function \[ D(\mathbf{y}) := (m_1(\mathbf{y})-m_0(\mathbf{y}), m_2(\mathbf{y})-m_1(\mathbf{y}),\ldots,m_n(\mathbf{y})-m_{n-1}(\mathbf{y})). \] We prove that, under certain assumptions on monotonicity of the kernels, $D$ is a homeomorphism between its domain and $\mathbb{R}^n.$</description>

      <title>Two Hornich-Hlawka-type and Gram matrix-based inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with Hornich-Hlawka-type and Gram matrix-based inequalities in inner product spaces (IPS). On the one hand, the Hornich-Hlawka inequality, or Hlawka's inequality, or quadrilateral inequality, is an inequality concerning three vectors in a quadrilateral. Namely, it states that for all $x,y,z$, $\lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert + \lVert z \rVert + \lVert x + y + z \rVert \geq \lVert x+y \rVert + \lVert x + z \rVert + \lVert y + z \rVert$. On the other hand, inequalities based on Gram matrices are very important because they generate generically all inequalities implying three vectors in an IPS. In the first part of our paper, we introduce a stronger version of Hornich-Hlawka inequality, namely, for all vectors $ x, y, z $, $ \|x\| \|y\| + \|z\| \|x + y + z\| \geq \|x + z\| \|y + z\|$. In the second part of our paper, we establish a sharp inequality based on Gram matrices that implies, in particular, the standard Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.</description>

      <title>Existence of minimizers for the SDRI model in $\mathbb{R}^n$: Wetting and dewetting regimes with mismatch strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence and the regularity results obtained in [37] for the variational model introduced in [36] to study the optimal shape of crystalline materials in the setting of stress-driven rearrangement instabilities (SDRI) are extended from two dimensions to any dimensions $n\geq2$. The energy is the sum of the elastic and the surface energy contributions, which cannot be decoupled, and depend on configurational pairs consisting of a set and a function that model the region occupied by the crystal and the bulk displacement field, respectively. By following the physical literature, the ``driving stress'' due to the mismatch between the ideal free-standing equilibrium lattice of the crystal with respect to adjacent materials is included in the model by considering a discontinuous mismatch strain in the elastic energy. Since two-dimensional methods and the methods used in the previous literature where Dirichlet boundary conditions instead of the mismatch strain and only the wetting regime were considered, cannot be employed in this setting, we proceed differently, by including in the analysis the dewetting regime and carefully analyzing the fine properties of energy-equibounded sequences. This analysis allows to establish both a compactness property in the family of admissible configurations and the lower-semicontinuity of the energy with respect to the topology induced by the $L^1$-convergence of sets and a.e.\ convergence of displacement fields, so that the direct method can be applied. We also prove that our arguments work as well in the setting with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>An $H^1$ multiplier theorem on anisotropic spaces</title>

Abstract: A parallel result of (the classical) Sledd--Stegenga's $H^1\rightarrow L^1$ multiplier theorem was obtained on the $H^1$ space under the anisotropic settings. Based on the same technique, an $H^1\rightarrow L^p$ multiplier theorem is also proved for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>Fractional integral on Hardy spaces on product domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the vector-valued theory of singular integrals, we prove a Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality on product Hardy spaces $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$, which is a parallel result of the classical Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality. The same technique shows the $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$-boundedness of the iterated Hilbert transform. As a byproduct, new proofs of several recently discovered Hardy type inequalities on product Hardy spaces are obtained, which avoid complicated Calder\'on--Zygmund theory on product domain, rendering them considerably simpler than the original proofs.</description>
