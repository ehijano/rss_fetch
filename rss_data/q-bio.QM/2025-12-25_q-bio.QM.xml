      <title>Transcriptome-Conditioned Personalized De Novo Drug Generation for AML Using Metaheuristic Assembly and Target-Driven Filtering</title>

Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond</description>

      <title>Aging health dynamics cross a tipping point near age 75</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aging includes both continuous gradual decline from microscopic mechanisms together with major deficit onset events such as morbidity, disability and ultimately death. These deficit events are stochastic, obscuring the connection between aging mechanisms and overall health. We propose a framework for modelling both the gradual effects of aging together with health deficit onset events, as reflected in the frailty index (FI) - a quantitative measure of overall age-related health. We model damage and repair dynamics of the FI from individual health transitions within two large longitudinal studies of aging health, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), which together included N=47592 individuals. We find that both damage resistance (robustness) and damage recovery (resilience) rates decline smoothly with both increasing age and with increasing FI, for both sexes. This leads to two distinct dynamical states: a robust and resilient young state of stable good health (low FI) and an older state that drifts towards poor health (high FI). These two health states are separated by a sharp transition near age 75. Since FI accumulation risk accelerates dramatically across this tipping point, ages 70-80 are crucial for understanding and managing late-life decline in health.</description>

      <title>Hillclimb-Causal Inference: A Data-Driven Approach to Identify Causal Pathways Among Parental Behaviors, Genetic Risk, and Externalizing Behaviors in Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Externalizing behaviors in children, such as aggression, hyperactivity, and defiance, are influenced by complex interplays between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, particularly parental behaviors. Unraveling these intricate causal relationships can benefit from the use of robust data-driven methods.
  Methods: We developed a method called Hillclimb-Causal Inference, a causal discovery approach that integrates the Hill Climb Search algorithm with a customized Linear Gaussian Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This method was applied to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which included parental behavior assessments, children's genotypes, and externalizing behavior measures. We performed dimensionality reduction to address multicollinearity among parental behaviors and assessed children's genetic risk for externalizing disorders using polygenic risk scores (PRS), which were computed based on GWAS summary statistics from independent cohorts. Once the causal pathways were identified, we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the relationships within the model.
  Results: We identified prominent causal pathways linking parental behaviors to children's externalizing outcomes. Parental alcohol misuse and broader behavioral issues exhibited notably stronger direct effects (0.33 and 0.20, respectively) compared to children's polygenic risk scores (0.07). Moreover, when considering both direct and indirect paths, parental substance misuse (alcohol, drug, and tobacco) collectively resulted in a total effect exceeding 1.1 on externalizing behaviors. Bootstrap and sensitivity analyses further validated the robustness of these findings.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Fractional Dynamical Networks Suppresses Epileptic Seizures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20950</link>

Abstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.</description>

      <title>Predicting Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease using Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease. Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.</description>
