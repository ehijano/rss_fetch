      <title>Hybrid basis and multi-center grid method for strong-field processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent framework that combines a hybrid Gaussian-FEDVR basis with a multicenter grid to simulate strong-field and attosecond dynamics in atoms and molecules. The method incorporates the construction of the orthonormal hybrid basis, the evaluation of electronic integrals, a unitary time-propagation scheme, and the extraction of optical and photoelectron observables. Its accuracy and robustness are benchmarked on one-electron systems such as atomic hydrogen and the dihydrogen cation ($\text{H}_{2}^{+}$) through comparisons with essentially-exact reference resutls for bound-state energies, high-harmonic generation spcetra, photoionization cross sections, and photoelectron momentum distributions. This work establishes the groundwork for its integration with quantum-chemistry methods, which are already operational but will be detailed in future work, thereby enabling ab initio simulations of correlated polyatomic systems in intense ultrafast laser fields.</description>

      <title>Towards a compact transportable optical clock based on the octupole transition in 171Yb+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical clocks have extremely attractive applications in many fields, including time-frequency metrology, validation of fundamental physical principles, and relativistic geodesy. The 467 nm octupole transition in 171Yb+ ion exhibits intrinsic insensitivity to magnetic field and an ultra-long clock state lifetime of 1.6 years. In addition, the entire laser system can be realized by semiconductor technologies, rendering this platform uniquely advantageous for developing high-precision, compact and transportable optical clocks. Here, we report the development of a compact optical clock based on the 467 nm transition of a single 171Yb+ ion. Using a narrow linewidth 467 nm laser to interrogate the clock transition, we obtain a near-Fourier-limited linewidth of 2.3 Hz in an integrated ion trapping system. Self-comparison demonstrated a frequency instability of 2.2E-15/sqrt(tau/s) with an interrogation time of 180 ms, which reaches the high parts in E-18 level with an averaging time of only one day. These work laid the technical foundation for the subsequent clock systematic evaluation and the packaging of each subsystem into an engineering prototype with high-precision at the level of E-18.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of diffusivity and plastic deformation in ultrasound-assisted cold spray of tungsten: a molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tungsten ($W$) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting point and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing $W$ using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound perturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic deformation of $W$ compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation observed in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of $W$. For different impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that ultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting grain boundaries and incorporating softening in $W$. Moreover, we found that this enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted $W$ can be exploited to promote interdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy formation. Through the formation of an equimolar $V$-$W$ alloy on a $W$ substrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct mechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited coating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the potential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for fabricating uniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of refractory metals.</description>

      <title>Injector for dielectric laser accelerators based on an ultracold electron source and a magnet design avoiding apparent emittance growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric Laser Acceleration holds the promise of extremely high acceleration gradients in laser-driven miniaturized accelerator structures. However, sub-relativistic experimental demonstration has so far been limited by bunch charges well below 1 electron per bunch due to the low acceptance of these 'accelerator-on-a-chip' devices. Here, we propose a novel design for an injector tailor made for dielectric laser acceleration, based on just-above-threshold ionization of laser-cooled atoms. The key new feature is a an innovative magnet design that avoids apparent emittance growth by using the field-free regions of an axially polarised ring of permanent magnets as source point. We optimized this design using a multi-objective optimization approach that is also applicable to the development of other sub-relativistic, high-brightness/low-emittance electron beam setups (like setups for ultrafast electron diffraction). The expected injected bunch charge of our proposed injector is 90 (60) electrons for a dielectric laser acceleration gradient of 1 GV/m (100MV/m) operating at a 10 micron driver laser wavelength, increasing the expected bunch charge by about two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Critical properties of bound states with one-boson-exchange potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss some general critical properties of bound states with one-boson-exchange potential. For simplicity, we first take a system with two identical scalar particles as an example. The interaction between these two scalar particles is described by the exchange of another massive scalar meson under the instantaneous approximation, which results in the Yukawa potential. A highly accurate numerical method is used to determine the critical screening mass value of the system. The resulting critical screening mass for the ground state is consistent with those reported in the literature, agreeing to about 30 significant figures. The highly accurate results for the $l=1$ case are also presented, which are significantly more precise than those previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to physical hadronic molecule states, where form factors are introduced in the interaction to describe the structure of hadrons. Our numerical results show that although the binding energies of the hadronic molecule states depend on the cutoff in the form factors, the number of hadronic molecule states is almost independent of the cutoffs across a very wide physical region. This indicates a strong and important property: the number of hadronic molecule states is almost solely determined by the coupling constants and the masses of the exchange particles. This highly accurate numerical method can also be straightforwardly applied to higher $l$ cases or other systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational waves with spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the Universe through gravitational-wave astronomy. However, high-frequency gravitational waves remain undetected. In this work, we propose that spin systems can be employed to detect gravitational waves in this unexplored frequency regime. We derive the spin's response to gravitational waves and identify three distinct effects: the well-known Gertsenshtein effect, a metric-induced interaction, and the gravitational spin Hall effect. We focus on nuclear spins and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance to enhance the gravitational response, leveraging the advantages of long coherence time, high polarization, and a small gyromagnetic ratio. The proposed experimental scheme is capable of probing gravitational waves in the kilohertz to gigahertz range, with projected sensitivities reaching $\sqrt{S_h}\approx10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Astigmatism-free 3D Optical Tweezer Control for Rapid Atom Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 136 $\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.</description>

      <title>Telecom-compatible cross-band quantum memory via dual photon modes dark-state polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential components of quantum networks, enabling synchronization, quantum repeaters, and long-distance entanglement distribution. Most ensemble-based realizations rely on dark-state polaritons (DSPs) in $\Lambda$-type systems that operate at near-infrared wavelengths, such as 795 nm in $^{87}$Rb, far from the telecom band where long fiber transmission is optimal. Here we identify a DSP in $^{87}$Rb that coherently couples two photonic modes at 795 nm and 1324 nm through a shared spin-wave coherence. We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the Fleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory protocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes. Numerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage and retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two wavelengths. The results demonstrate a dual-wavelength memory that unifies node-band and telecom-band operation within a single ensemble, providing a potential route toward frequency-conversion-free quantum-network interfaces.</description>

      <title>Low-noise environment for probing fundamental symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and characterization of a low-noise environment for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) with a beam of molecules. To minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic electric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external magnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer mu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial direction and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the difference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between sections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field inside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and above, rising to 500 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical studies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline is maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric field of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below 1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the direction of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104 hours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for measuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The design principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly applicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in molecules, atoms, and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Relativistic quintuple-zeta basis sets for the s block</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic basis sets of quintuple-zeta quality are presented for the s-block elements. The basis sets include SCF exponents for the occupied spinors and for the np shell (the latter is considered here a valence orbital). Valence and core correlating functions were optimized within multireference SDCI calculations for the ground valence configuration. Diffuse functions optimized for the corresponding anions or derived from neighboring elements are also provided. The new basis sets were applied to a range of basic atomic and molecular properties for benchmarking purposes. Smooth convergence to the basis set limit is observed with increased basis set quality from existing double-zeta, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta to the newly developed quintuple-zeta basis sets. Use of these basis sets in combination with state-of-the-art approaches for treatment of relativity and correlation will allow achieving higher accuracy and lower uncertainty than previously possible in calculations on heavy atoms and molecules. The basis sets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17088050.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray cavity quantum optics with inner-shell transitions has been hindered by the overlap between resonant and continuum states. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of cavity-controlled co-to-core resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We eliminate the effects of the absorption edge by monitoring the RIXS profile, thereby resolving the resonant state from the overlapping continuum. We observe distinct cavity-induced energy shifts and cavity-enhanced decay rate in the $2p3d$ RIXS spectra of WSi$_{2}$. These effects, manifesting as stretched or shifted profiles in the RIXS planes, enable novel spectroscopic applications by cavity-controlled core-hole states. Our results establish core-to-core RIXS as a powerful tool for manipulating inner-shell dynamics in x-ray cavities, offering new avenues for integrating quanutm optical effects with x-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Landscape of scattering universality with general dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>

      <title>Design and assembly of a cavity microscope with high numerical aperture for quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the quantum state of the generated harmonics of a driven Bose gas is a classical mixture, while below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation the emitted harmonic radiation is in a pure quantum state. These states furthermore exhibit squeezing and entanglement across all field modes.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetry breaking and non-reciprocity in a driven-dissipative Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</description>
