      <title>Lithium-ion battery modelling for nonisothermal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonequilibrium thermodynamic model is presented for the nonisothermal lithium-ion battery cell. Coupling coefficients, all significant for transport of heat, mass, charge and chemical reaction, were used to model profiles of temperature, concentration and electric potential for each layer of the cell. Electrode surfaces were modelled with excess properties. Extending earlier works, we included lithium diffusion in the electrodes, and explained the cell's thermal signature due to Peltier and Soret effects.
  We showed that the model is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, meaning that the entropy production computed at steady state from entropy fluxes is equal to the integral over the sum of flux-force products. The procedure is beneficial in electrochemical cell modelling as it reveals inconsistencies.
  The model was solved for typical lithium-ion battery materials. The coupling coefficients for transport of salts and solvents lead to significant concentration polarization. Thermal polarization is then negligible. We show that a zero-valued heat flux is not necessarily synonymous with a zero temperature gradient. Results are important for efforts that aim to avoid local hot spots. A program code is made available for testing and applications. The program is designed to solve dynamic boundary value problems posed by the electrode surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical deconstruction of vibrational energy transfer rate and pathways modified by collective vibrational strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and the optical cavity field can modify vibrational energy transfer (VET) processes in molecular systems. However, the underlying mechanisms and the behavior of individual molecules under collective VSC remain largely incomplete. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art quantum vibrational spectral calculation, quantum wavepacket dynamics simulations, and ab initio machine-learning potential to elucidate how the vibrational dynamics of water OH stretches can be altered by VSC. Taking the (H$_2$O)$_{21}$-cavity system as an example, we show that the collective VSC breaks the localization picture, promotes the delocalization of OH stretches, and opens new intermolecular vibrational energy pathways involving both neighboring and remote water molecules. The manipulation of the VET process relies on the alignment of the transition dipole moment orientations of the corresponding vibrational states. The emergence of new energy transfer pathways is found to be attributed to cavity-induced vibrational resonance involving OH stretches across different water molecules, along with alterations in mode coupling patterns. Our fully quantum theoretical calculations not only confirm and extend previous findings on cavity-modified energy transfer processes but also provide new insights in energy transfer processes under collective VSC.</description>

      <title>Constant-Potential Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Simulations Reveal Potential-Regulated Cu Cluster Formation on MoS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical processes play a crucial role in energy storage and conversion systems, yet their computational modeling remains a significant challenge. Accurately incorporating the effects of electric potential has been a central focus in theoretical electrochemistry. Although constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics (CP-AIMD) has provided valuable insights, it is limited by its substantial computational demands. Here, we introduce the Explicit Electric Potential Machine Learning Force Field (EEP-MLFF) model. Our model integrates the electric potential as an explicit input parameter along with the atom-centered descriptors in the atomic neural network. This approach enables the evaluation of nuclear forces under arbitrary electric potentials, thus facilitating molecular dynamics simulations at a specific potential. By applying the proposed machine learning method to the Cu/1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_{2}$ system, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the potential-modulated Cu atom migration and aggregation lead to the formation of small steric Cu clusters (Single Clusters, SCs) at potentials below -0.1 V. The morphological transformations of adsorbed Cu atoms are elucidated through electronic structure analyses, which demonstrates that both Cu-S and Cu-Cu bonding can be effectively tuned by the applied electric potential. Our findings present an opportunity for the convenient manufacture of single metal cluster catalysts through potential modulation. Moreover, this theoretical framework facilitates the exploration of potential-regulated processes and helps investigate the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Mode-selective Raman imaging of metal-organic frameworks reveals surface heterogeneities of single HKUST-1 crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials with high surface-to-volume ratio that have potential applications as gas sorbents. Sample quality is, however, often compromised and it is unclear how defects and surface contaminants affect the spectral properties of single MOF crystals. Raman micro-spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing MOFs, yet spatial spectral heterogeneity distributions of single MOF crystals have not been reported so far. In this work, we use Raman micro-spectroscopy to characterize spatially isolated, single crystals of the MOF species HKUST-1. In a first step, we validate HKUST-1's Raman spectrum based on DFT simulations and we identify a previously unreported vibrational feature. In a second step, we acquire diffraction-limited, mode-selective Raman images of a single HKUST-1 crystals that reveal how the spectral variations are distributed across the crystal surface. In a third step, we statistically analyze the measured spectral peak positions and line widths for quantifying the variability occurring within the same crystal as well as between different crystals taken from the same batch. Finally, we explore how multivariate data analysis can aid feature identification in Raman images of single MOF crystals. For enabling validation and reuse, we have made the spectroscopic data and simulation code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Light-Matter Hybridization and Entanglement from the First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybridization between light and matter is fundamental for achieving cavity-induced control over quantum materials, necessitating accurate ab initio methods for their analysis. Among these, the quantum electrodynamics Hartree-Fock framework stands out as an essential mean field approximation for electron-electron and electron-photon interactions, forming the basis for advanced post-Hartree-Fock methods like quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster and auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo. However, trivial quantum electrodynamics Hartere-Fock (QEDHF) methods assume a product state ans\"atze and thus cannot describe the light-matter Entanglement. Furthermore, our previous work on variational ans\"atze approaches lacked the capability to capture anharmonic or nonlinear fluctuations, limiting their applicability to strongly coupled systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose an extended QEDHF formalism by introducing a variational Squeeze transformation capable of describing anharmonic quantum fluctuations in photon fields. By optimizing the squeezing parameters, our framework provides a more nuanced and accurate characterization of photon field quantum fluctuations, significantly enhancing the predictive power of QEDHF in strong coupling regimes. Moreover, this formalism enhances the description of light-matter Entanglement, providing a first-principles framework for understanding light-matter hybridization and paving the way for deeper insights into cavity-modified quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Phase-Space Electronic Hamiltonian for Molecules in a Static Magnetic Field I: Conservation of Total Pseudomomentum and Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a phase-space electronic structure theory of molecules in magnetic fields. For a system of electrons in a magnetic field with vector potential $\bf{A}(\hat{\bf{r}})$, the usual Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian is the sum of the nuclear kinetic energy and the electronic Hamiltonian, $\frac{(\bf{P} - q\bf{A}(\bf{X}) )^2}{2M} + \hat{H}_{e}(\bf{X})$ (where $q$ is a nuclear charge). To include the effects of coupled nuclear-electron motion in the presence of magnetic field, we propose that the proper phase-space electronic structure Hamiltonian will be of the form $\frac{(\bf{P} - q^{\textit{eff}}\bf{A}(\bf{X}) - e\hat{\bf{\Gamma}})^2}{2M} + \hat{H}_{e}(\bf{X})$. Here, $q^{\textit{eff}}$ represents the {\em screened} nuclear charges and the $\hat{\bf{\Gamma}}$ term captures the local pseudomomentum of the electrons. This form reproduces exactly the energy levels for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field; moreover, single-surface dynamics along the eigenstates is guaranteed to conserve both the total pseudomomentum as well as the total angular momentum in the direction of the magnetic field. This Hamiltonian form can be immediately implemented within modern electronic structure packages (where the electronic orbitals will now depend on nuclear position ($\bf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\bf{P}$)). One can expect to find novel beyond Born-Oppenheimer magnetic field effects for strong enough fields and/or nonadiabatic systems.</description>

      <title>A Phase-Space Electronic Hamiltonian for Molecules in a Static Magnetic Field II: Quantum Chemistry Calculations with Gauge Invariant Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a companion paper, we have developed a phase-space electronic structure theory of molecules in magnetic fields, whereby the electronic energy levels arise from diagonalizing a phase-space Hamiltonian $\hat H_{PS}(\bf{X},\bf{\Pi})$ that depends parametrically on nuclear position and momentum. The resulting eigenvalues are translationally invariant; moreover, if the magnetic field is in the $z-$direction, then the eigenvalues are also invariant to rotations around the $z-$direction. However, like all Hamiltonians in a magnetic field, the theory has a gauge degree of freedom (corresponding to the position of the magnetic origin in the vector potential), and requires either $(i)$ formally, a complete set of electronic states or $(ii)$ in practice, gauge invariant atomic orbitals (GIAOs) in order to realize such translational and rotational invariance. Here we describe how to implement a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian using GIAOs within a practical electronic structure package (in our case, Q-Chem). We further show that novel phenomena can be observed with finite $\bf{B}-$fields, including minimum energy structures with $\bf{\Pi}_{min} \ne 0$, indicating non-zero electronic motion in the ground-state.</description>
