      <title>Bounds of Block Rewards in Honest PinFi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PinFi is a class of novel protocols for decentralized pricing of dissipative assets, whose value naturally declines over time. Central to the protocol's functionality and its market efficiency is the role of liquidity providers (LPs). This study addresses critical stability and sustainability challenges within the protocol, namely: the propensity of LPs to prefer selling in external markets over participation in the protocol; a similar inclination towards selling within the PinFi system rather than contributing as LPs; and a scenario where LPs are disinclined to sell within the protocol. Employing a game-theoretic approach, we explore PinFi's mechanisms and its broader ramifications. Our findings reveal that, under a variety of common conditions and with an assumption of participant integrity, PinFi is capable of fostering a dynamic equilibrium among LPs, sellers, and buyers. This balance is maintained through a carefully calibrated range of block rewards for LPs, ensuring the protocol's long-term stability and utility.</description>

      <title>Prompting for Numerical Sequences: A Case Study on Market Comment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to a wide range of data-to-text generation tasks, including tables, graphs, and time-series numerical data-to-text settings. While research on generating prompts for structured data such as tables and graphs is gaining momentum, in-depth investigations into prompting for time-series numerical data are lacking. Therefore, this study explores various input representations, including sequences of tokens and structured formats such as HTML, LaTeX, and Python-style codes. In our experiments, we focus on the task of Market Comment Generation, which involves taking a numerical sequence of stock prices as input and generating a corresponding market comment. Contrary to our expectations, the results show that prompts resembling programming languages yield better outcomes, whereas those similar to natural languages and longer formats, such as HTML and LaTeX, are less effective. Our findings offer insights into creating effective prompts for tasks that generate text from numerical sequences.</description>

      <title>Exploration of improved, roller-based spreading strategies for cohesive powders in additive manufacturing via coupled DEM-FEM simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spreading of fine (D50 &lt;=20um) powders into thin layers typically requires a mechanism such as a roller to overcome the cohesive forces between particles. Roller-based spreading requires careful optimization and can result in low density and/or inconsistent layers depending on the characteristics of the powder feedstock. Here, we explore improved, roller-based spreading strategies for highly cohesive powders using an integrated discrete element-finite element (DEM-FEM) framework. Powder characteristics are emulated using a self-similarity approach based on experimental calibration for a Ti-6Al-4V 0-20um powder. We find that optimal roller-based spreading relies on a combination of surface friction of the roller and roller kinematics that impart sufficient kinetic energy to break cohesive bonds between powder particles. However, excess rotation can impart excessive kinetic energy, causing ejection of particles and a non-uniform layer. Interestingly, the identified optimal surface velocities for counter-rotation as well as rotational oscillation are very similar, suggesting this quantity as the critical kinematic parameter. When these conditions are chosen appropriately, layers with packing fractions beyond 50% are predicted for layer thicknesses as small as ~2 times D90 of the exemplary powder, and the layer quality is robust with respect to substrate adhesion over a 10-fold range. The latter is an important consideration given the spatially varying substrate conditions in AM due to the combination of fused/bound and bare powder regions. As compared to counter-rotation, the proposed rotational oscillation is particularly attractive because it can overcome practical issues with mechanical runout of roller mechanisms. In particular, the application to rubber-coated rollers, which promises to reduce the risk of tool damage and particle streaking, is recommended for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Financial Risk Management on a Neutral Atom Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning models capable of handling the large datasets collected in the financial world can often become black boxes expensive to run. The quantum computing paradigm suggests new optimization techniques, that combined with classical algorithms, may deliver competitive, faster and more interpretable models. In this work we propose a quantum-enhanced machine learning solution for the prediction of credit rating downgrades, also known as fallen-angels forecasting in the financial risk management field. We implement this solution on a neutral atom Quantum Processing Unit with up to 60 qubits on a real-life dataset. We report competitive performances against the state-of-the-art Random Forest benchmark whilst our model achieves better interpretability and comparable training times. We examine how to improve performance in the near-term validating our ideas with Tensor Networks-based numerical simulations.</description>
