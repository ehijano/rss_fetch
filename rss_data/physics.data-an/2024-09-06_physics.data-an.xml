      <title>A Bayesian Optimization through Sequential Monte Carlo and Statistical Physics-Inspired Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for an application of Bayesian optimization using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and concepts from the statistical physics of classical systems. Our method leverages the power of modern machine learning libraries such as NumPyro and JAX, allowing us to perform Bayesian optimization on multiple platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and in parallel. Our approach enables a low entry level for exploration of the methods while maintaining high performance. We present a promising direction for developing more efficient and effective techniques for a wide range of optimization problems in diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Phase Interpolation for estimating the asymptotic phase of a limit cycle oscillator from time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhythmic activity commonly observed in biological systems, occurring from the cellular level to the organismic level, is typically modeled as limit cycle oscillators. The phase reduction theory serves as a useful analytical framework for elucidating the synchronization mechanism of these oscillators. Essentially, this theory describes the dynamics of a multi-dimensional nonlinear oscillator using a single variable phase model. In order to understand and control the rhythmic phenomena in the real world, it is crucial to estimate the asymptotic phase from the observed data. In this study, we propose a new method, Gaussian Process Phase Interpolation (GPPI), for estimating the asymptotic phase from time series data. The GPPI method first evaluates the asymptotic phase on the limit cycle and subsequently estimates the asymptotic phase outside the limit cycle employing Gaussian process regression. Thanks to the high expressive power of Gaussian processes, the GPPI is capable of capturing a variety of functions. Notably, the GPPI is easily applicable even when the dimension of the system increases. The performance of the GPPI is tested by using simulation data from the Stuart-Landau oscillator and the Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator. The results demonstrate that the GPPI can accurately estimate the asymptotic phase even in the presence of high observation noise and strong nonlinearity. Additionally, the GPPI is demonstrated as an effective tool for data-driven phase control of a Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator. Thus, the proposed GPPI will facilitate the data-driven modeling of the limit cycle oscillators.</description>

      <title>Simple measures to capture the robustness and the plasticity of soil microbial communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil microbial communities are known to be robust against perturbations such as nutrition inputs, which appears as an obstacle for the soil improvement. On the other hand, its adaptable aspect has been also reported. Here we propose simple measures for these seemingly contradicting features of soil microbial communities, robustness and plasticity, based on the distribution of the populations. The first measure is the similarity in the population balance, i.e. the shape of the distribution function, which is found to show resilience against the nutrition inputs. The other is the similarity in the composition of the species measured by the rank order of the population, which shows an adaptable response during the population balance is recovering. These results clearly show that the soil microbial system is robust (or, homeostatic) in its population balance, while the composition of the species is rather plastic and adaptable.</description>

      <title>Sensor fusion luminescence thermometry better together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminescent thermometers are highly effective in niche applications such as nanothermometry, in vivo imaging, and extreme conditions like high electromagnetic fields, radiation, and under mechanical or chemical stress. Advancing measurement precision, temperature resolution, and extending the temperature range are the main problems in this rapidly evolving research field, crucial in the work of R&amp;D industry engineers and scientific researchers. Traditionally using single parameter for sensing leads to the sensor underperformance. Sensor fusion (SF), a well-established statistical tool used to enhance precision in autonomous vehicles, navigation systems, medical imaging, and wearable devices is here engineered for luminescent thermometry, by either fusing multiple sensor probes, or observing each temperature dependent feature as a separate sensor, resulting in always increased precision and extended usable temperature range. SF is a replacement and superior alternative to multiple linear regression models as it stands out for its versatility, enabling performance limits to be reached with any sensor probe material. It is compatible with both time-resolved and steady-state readouts, used independently or in combination, with single or multiple excitations. The benefits are illustrated using probes with Mn5+, Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+, Sm2+, and Mn4+/Ho3+/Cr3+ activator ions.</description>
