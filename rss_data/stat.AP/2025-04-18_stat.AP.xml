      <title>Bias in studies of prenatal exposures using real-world data due to pregnancy identification method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Researchers typically identify pregnancies in healthcare data based on observed outcomes (e.g., delivery). This outcome-based approach misses pregnancies that received prenatal care but whose outcomes were not recorded (e.g., at-home miscarriage), potentially inducing selection bias in effect estimates for prenatal exposures. Alternatively, prenatal encounters can be used to identify pregnancies, including those with unobserved outcomes. However, this prenatal approach requires methods to address missing data. Methods: We simulated 10,000,000 pregnancies and estimated the total effect of initiating treatment on the risk of preeclampsia. We generated data for 36 scenarios in which we varied the effect of treatment on miscarriage and/or preeclampsia; the percentage with missing outcomes (5% or 20%); and the cause of missingness: (1) measured covariates, (2) unobserved miscarriage, and (3) a mix of both. We then created three analytic samples to address missing pregnancy outcomes: observed deliveries, observed deliveries and miscarriages, and all pregnancies. Treatment effects were estimated using non-parametric direct standardization. Results: Risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) from the three analytic samples were similarly biased when all missingness was due to unobserved miscarriage (log-transformed RR bias range: -0.12-0.33 among observed deliveries; -0.11-0.32 among observed deliveries and miscarriages; and -0.11-0.32 among all pregnancies). When predictors of missingness were measured, only the all pregnancies approach was unbiased (-0.27-0.33; -0.29-0.03; and -0.02-0.01, respectively). Conclusions: When all missingness was due to miscarriage, the analytic samples returned similar effect estimates. Only among all pregnancies did bias decrease as the proportion of missingness due to measured variables increased.</description>

      <title>TransST: Transfer Learning Embedded Spatial Factor Modeling of Spatial Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Density-Density Regression with Application to Cell-Cell Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a scalable framework for regressing multivariate distributions onto multivariate distributions, motivated by the application of inferring cell-cell communication from population-scale single-cell data. The observed data consist of pairs of multivariate distributions for ligands from one cell type and corresponding receptors from another. For each ordered pair $e=(l,r)$ of cell types $(l \neq r)$ and each sample $i = 1, \ldots, n$, we observe a pair of distributions $(F_{ei}, G_{ei})$ of gene expressions for ligands and receptors of cell types $l$ and $r$, respectively. The aim is to set up a regression of receptor distributions $G_{ei}$ given ligand distributions $F_{ei}$. A key challenge is that these distributions reside in distinct spaces of differing dimensions. We formulate the regression of multivariate densities on multivariate densities using a generalized Bayes framework with the sliced Wasserstein distance between fitted and observed distributions. Finally, we use inference under such regressions to define a directed graph for cell-cell communications.</description>

      <title>Spatial Functional Deep Neural Network Model: A New Prediction Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of spatially dependent functional data is critical for various engineering and scientific applications. In this study, a spatial functional deep neural network model was developed with a novel non-linear modeling framework that seamlessly integrates spatial dependencies and functional predictors using deep learning techniques. The proposed model extends classical scalar-on-function regression by incorporating a spatial autoregressive component while leveraging functional deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear relationships. To ensure a robust estimation, the methodology employs an adaptive estimation approach, where the spatial dependence parameter was first inferred via maximum likelihood estimation, followed by non-linear functional regression using deep learning. The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and an application to Brazilian COVID-19 data, where the goal was to predict the average daily number of deaths. Comparative analysis with maximum likelihood-based spatial functional linear regression and functional deep neural network models demonstrates that the proposed algorithm significantly improves predictive performance. The results for the Brazilian COVID-19 data showed that while all models achieved similar mean squared error values over the training modeling phase, the proposed model achieved the lowest mean squared prediction error in the testing phase, indicating superior generalization ability.</description>

Abstract: Econometrics in general, and Panel Data methods in particular, are becoming crucial in Public Health Economics and Social Policy analysis. In this discussion paper, we employ a helpful approach of Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) to assess if there are statistically relevant relationships between hemoglobin (adjusted to sea-level), weight, and height from 2007 to 2022 in children up to five years of age in Peru. By using this method, we may find a tool that allows us to confirm if the relationships considered between the target variables by the Peruvian agencies and authorities are in the right direction to fight against chronic malnutrition and stunting.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional scaling informed by $F$-statistic: Visualizing grouped microbiome data with inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a dimensionality reduction technique for microbial ecology data analysis that represents the multivariate structure while preserving pairwise distances between samples. While its improvement has enhanced the ability to reveal data patterns by sample groups, these MDS-based methods require prior assumptions for inference, limiting their application in general microbiome analysis. In this study, we introduce a new MDS-based ordination, $F$-informed MDS, which configures the data distribution based on the $F$-statistic, the ratio of dispersion between groups sharing common and different characteristics. Using simulated compositional datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to hyperparameter selection while maintaining statistical significance throughout the ordination process. Various quality metrics for evaluating dimensionality reduction confirm that $F$-informed MDS is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in preserving both local and global data structures. Its application to a diatom-associated bacterial community suggests the role of this new method in interpreting the community response to the host. Our approach offers a well-founded refinement of MDS that aligns with statistical test results, which can be beneficial for broader compositional data analyses in microbiology and ecology. This new visualization tool can be incorporated into standard microbiome data analyses.</description>

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease, with the knee being the most commonly affected joint. Modern studies of knee joint injury and OA often measure biomechanical variables, particularly forces exerted during walking. However, the relationship among gait patterns, clinical profiles, and OA disease remains poorly understood. These biomechanical forces are typically represented as curves over time, but until recently, studies have relied on discrete values (or landmarks) to summarize these curves. This work aims to demonstrate the added value of analyzing full movement curves over conventional discrete summaries. Using data from the Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) study (Messier et al., 2009, 2013), we developed a shape-based representation of variation in the full biomechanical curves. Compared to conventional discrete summaries, our approach yields more powerful predictors of disease severity and relevant clinical traits, as demonstrated by a nested model comparison. Notably, our work is among the first to use movement curves to predict disease measures and to quantitatively evaluate the added value of analyzing full movement curves over conventional discrete summaries.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a framework for high-resolution mortality simulations tailored to insured and general populations. Due to the scarcity of detailed demographic-specific mortality data, we leverage Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Monte Carlo simulations to generate refined mortality tables that incorporate age, gender, smoker status, and regional distributions. This methodology enhances public health planning and actuarial analysis by providing enriched datasets for improved life expectancy projections and insurance product development.</description>

      <title>Improving Statistical Postprocessing for Extreme Wind Speeds using Tuned Weighted Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent statistical postprocessing methods for wind speed forecasts have incorporated linear models and neural networks to produce more skillful probabilistic forecasts in the low-to-medium wind speed range. At the same time, these methods struggle in the high-to-extreme wind speed range. In this work, we aim to increase the performance in this range by training using a weighted version of the continuous ranked probability score (wCRPS). We develop an approach using shifted Gaussian cdf weight functions, whose parameters are tuned using a multi-objective hyperparameter tuning algorithm that balances performance on low and high wind speed ranges. We explore this approach for both linear models and convolutional neural network models combined with various parametric distributions, namely the truncated normal, log-normal, and generalized extreme value distributions, as well as adaptive mixtures. We apply these methods to forecasts from KNMI's deterministic Harmonie-Arome numerical weather prediction model to obtain probabilistic wind speed forecasts in the Netherlands for 48 hours ahead. For linear models we observe that even with a tuned weight function, training using the wCRPS produces a strong body-tail trade-off, where increased performance on extremes comes at the price of lower performance for the bulk of the distribution. For the best models using convolutional neural networks, we find that using a tuned weight function the performance on extremes can be increased without a significant deterioration in performance on the bulk. The best-performing weight function is shown to be model-specific. Finally, the choice of distribution has no significant impact on the performance of our models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking multi-step methods for the dynamic prediction of survival with numerous longitudinal predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the growing availability of biomedical datasets featuring numerous longitudinal covariates has motivated the development of several multi-step methods for the dynamic prediction of time-to-event ("survival") outcomes. These methods employ either mixed-effects models or multivariate functional principal component analysis to model and summarize the longitudinal covariates' evolution over time. Then, they use Cox models or random survival forests to predict survival probabilities, using as covariates both baseline variables and the summaries of the longitudinal variables obtained in the previous modelling step.
  Because these multi-step methods are still quite new, to date little is known about their applicability, limitations, and predictive performance when applied to real-world data. To gain a better understanding of these aspects, we performed a benchmarking of the aforementioned multi-step methods (and two simpler prediction approaches) based on three datasets that differ in sample size, number of longitudinal covariates and length of follow-up. We discuss the different modelling choices made by these methods, and some adjustments that one may need to do in order to be able to apply them to real-world data. Furthermore, we compare their predictive performance using multiple performance measures and landmark times, and assess their computing time.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimate under a Time-Varying Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a wealth of behaviors, have previously received little attention in the signal processing literature. In this work, a generalized time-varying autoregressive model is considered, encompassing, but not reducing to, a state-of-the-art model of viral epidemics propagation. The time-varying parameter of this model is estimated via the minimization of a penalized likelihood estimator. A major challenge is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters fine-tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the time-varying autoregressive Poisson model, the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, better accounting for intrinsic variability of the contamination while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the overall data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number demonstrating its ability to yield very consistent estimates.</description>

      <title>Effect of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels on low-voltage feeders: Evidence from smart meter profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and solar panels are low-carbon technologies (LCTs) that are being connected to the low-voltage grid (LVG) at a rapid pace. One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the distribution system operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modelled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.</description>

Abstract: The growing power of data science can play a crucial role in addressing social discrimination, necessitating nuanced understanding and effective mitigation strategies for biases. "Data Science Looks At Discrimination" (DSLD) is an R and Python package designed to provide users with a comprehensive toolkit of statistical and graphical methods for assessing possible discrimination related to protected groups such as race, gender, and age. The package addresses critical issues by identifying and mitigating confounders and reducing bias against protected groups in prediction algorithms.
  In educational settings, DSLD offers instructors powerful tools to teach statistical principles through motivating real world examples of discrimination analysis. The inclusion of an 80 page Quarto book further supports users from statistics educators to legal professionals in effectively applying these analytical tools to real world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Approach to Calibration-Free Localization Using Unlabeled Crowdsourced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fingerprinting-based indoor localization methods typically require labor-intensive site surveys to collect signal measurements at known reference locations and frequent recalibration, which limits their scalability. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel approach for indoor localization that utilizes crowdsourced data without location labels. We leverage the statistical information of crowdsourced data and propose a cumulative distribution function (CDF) based distance estimation method that maps received signal strength (RSS) to distances from access points. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional distance estimation based on the empirical path loss model by efficiently capturing the impacts of shadow fading and multipath. Compared to fingerprinting, our unsupervised statistical approach eliminates the need for signal measurements at known reference locations. The estimated distances are then integrated into a three-step framework to determine the target location. The localization performance of our proposed method is evaluated using RSS data generated from ray-tracing simulations. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in localization accuracy compared to methods based on the empirical path loss model. Furthermore, our statistical approach, which relies on unlabeled data, achieves localization accuracy comparable to that of the supervised approach, the $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) algorithm, which requires fingerprints with location labels. For reproducibility and future research, we make the ray-tracing dataset publicly available at [2].</description>
