      <title>Sundman-like transformations and the NRT nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new generalization of the well-known power-type Sundman transformation, involving not only powers of the function but also of its derivative, along with its inverse. Our aim is to explore the use of such transformations in the derivation of solutions of ordinary differential equations and in the study of their properties. We then show their usefulness in the framework of the nonlinear Nobre--Reigo-Monteiro--Tsallis (NRT) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. More precisely, we employ them to analyze a family of ordinary differential equations which includes the Lorentzian solutions of the NRT-nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for a constant potential. Moreover, an explicit expression for the Lorentzian solitary wave solutions is given, for any real value of the non-linearity parameter q, in terms of a transformation depending on q applied to the classical Lorentzian solution with q = 1, i.e., we succeed in encapsulating the whole nonlinear behavior in the new transformations. In addition, the composition of this transformation with its inverse (with different parameters) allows us to perform a shift in the nonlinearity parameter q. Moreover, a certain subfamily of our generalized transformations, which perform a shift on the non-linearity parameter q of the Lorentzian solutions, is found to have a group structure. The same subfamily of transformations allows us, again, to perform a shift in the non-linearity parameter q, but in this case in the traveling wave solution for a free particle.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality with Respect to the Hermite Product, KP Wave Functions, and the Bispectral Involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that for any wave function $\psi(x,z)$ of the KP Hierarchy, there is another wave function called its ``adjoint'' such that the path integral of their product with respect to $z$ around any sufficiently large closed path is zero. For the wave functions in the adelic Grassmannian $Gr^{ad}$, the bispectral involution which exchanges the role of $x$ and $z$ implies also the existence of an ``$x$-adjoint wave function'' $\psi^{\star}(x,z)$ so that the product of the wave function, the $x$-adjoint, and the Hermite weight $e^{-x^2/2}$ has no residue. Utilizing this, we show that the sequences of coefficient functions in the power series expansion of any KP wave function in $Gr^{ad}$ and its image under the bispectral involution at $t_2=-1/2$ are always ``almost bi-orthogonal'' with respect to the Hermite product. Whether the sequences have the stronger properties of being (almost) orthogonal can be determined easily in terms of KP flows and the bispectral involution. As a special case, the Exceptional Hermite Orthogonal Polynomials can be recovered in this way. This provides both a generalization of and an explanation of the fact that the generating functions of the Exceptional Hermites are certain special wave functions of the KP Hierarchy. In addition, one new surprise is that the same KP Wave Function which generates the sequences of functions is also a generating function for the norms when evaluated at $t_1=1$ and $t_2=0$. The main results are proved using Calogero-Moser matrices satisfying a rank one condition. The same results also apply in the case of ``spin-generalized'' Calogero-Moser matrices, which produce instances of matrix orthogonality.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of spectral duality between the classical XXX spin chain and the rational reduced Gaudin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large $N$ limit of the spectral duality between the classical $\mathfrak{gl}_M$ XXX spin chain and the $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ trigonometric Gaudin model in its rational reduced form. The infinite-dimensional limit of the Gaudin model is constructed within the framework of the noncommutative torus algebra, following the approach of Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen. In this formulation, the matrix dynamical variables are promoted to fields on the torus, and the corresponding Lax equations acquire the Moyal star-product structure. The dual model is obtained as the large $N$ limit of the $\mathfrak{gl}_M$ classical XXX spin chain with $N$ sites, represented by Laurent series satisfying a quadratic $r$-matrix relation associated with the rational solution of the classical Yang--Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Double flip bifurcations in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-symmetric Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new bifurcation in Hamiltonian systems, which we call the double flip bifurcation. The Hamiltonian depends on two parameters, one of which controls the double flip bifurcation. The result of the bifurcation is the occurrence of two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations with respect to the other parameter. The two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations are simultaneous with respect to the first parameter, and are connected by a curve-segment of singular points. We find a normal form for Hamiltonians describing systems going through double flip bifurcations, and compute said normal form for some examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the three-dimensional stationary equations of a polytropic gas and employs symmetry methods to construct exact analytical solutions. In the Chaplygin gas case, the analysis yields a highly general solution family depending on three arbitrary functions, while the general adiabatic index formulation admits explicit solutions parameterized by several constants.</description>

      <title>Stability of intrinsic localized modes on the lattice with competing power nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation with competing powers (p,q) satisfying 2 &lt;= p &lt; q. The physically relevant cases are given by (p,q) = (2,3), (p,q) = (3,4), and (p,q) = (3,5). In the anticontinuum limit, all intrinsic localized modes are compact and can be classified by their codes, which record one of two nonzero (smaller and larger) states and their sign alternations. By using the spectral stability analysis, we prove that the codes for larger states of the same sign are spectrally and nonlinearly (orbitally) stable, whereas the codes for smaller states of the alternating signs are spectrally stable but have eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. We also identify numerically the spectrally stable codes which consist of stacked combinations of the sign-definite larger states and the sign-alternating smaller states.</description>

      <title>Floquet Recurrences in the Double Kicked Top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact quantum recurrences in the double kicked top (DKT), a driven spin model that extends the quantum kicked top (QKT) by introducing an additional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kick. Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = j\pi/2$ and $k_r = j\pi/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_\theta$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = j\pi/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_\theta = \pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_\theta = 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $j\pi/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of degrees for lattice equations: a singularity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of degree growth and algebraic entropy plays a crucial role in the field of discrete integrable systems. However, a general method for calculating degree growth for lattice equations (partial difference equations) is not yet known. Here we propose a method to rigorously compute the exact degree of each iterate for lattice equations. Halburd's method, which is a novel approach to computing the exact degree of each iterate for mappings (recurrence relations, typically from ordinary difference equations) from the singularity structure, forms the basis of our idea. The strategy is to extend this method to lattice equations. First, we illustrate, without rigorous details, how to calculate degrees for lattice equations using the lattice version of Halburd's method, and outline the issues that must be resolved to make the method rigorous. We then provide a framework to ensure that all calculations are accurate and rigorous. We further address how to detect the singularity structure in lattice equations. Our method is not only accurate and rigorous but can also be easily applied to a wide range of lattice equations.</description>

      <title>Genus two KdV soliton gases and their long-time asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs the Riemann-Hilbert problem to provide a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the high-genus Korteweg-de Vries soliton gases. It is demonstrated that the two-genus soliton gas is related to the two-phase Riemann-Theta function as \(x \to +\infty\), and approaches to zero as \(x \to -\infty\). Additionally, the long-time asymptotic behavior of this two-genus soliton gas can be categorized into five distinct regions in the \(x\)-\(t\) plane, which from left to right are rapidly decay, modulated one-phase wave, unmodulated one-phase wave, modulated two-phase wave, and unmodulated two-phase wave. Moreover, an innovative method is introduced to solve the model problem associated with the high-genus Riemann surface, leading to the determination of the leading terms, which is also related with the multi-phase Riemann-Theta function. A general discussion on the case of arbitrary \(N\)-genus soliton gas is also presented.</description>

      <title>Rational Solutions of Painlev\'e V from Hankel Determinants and the Asymptotics of Their Pole Locations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the poles of certain rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'e equation. These solutions are constructed by relating the corresponding tau function to a Hankel determinant of a certain sequence of moments. This approach was also used by one of the authors and collaborators in the study of the rational solutions of the second Painlev\'e equation. More specifically, we study the roots of the corresponding polynomial tau function, whose location corresponds to the poles of the associated rational solution. We show that, upon suitable rescaling, the roots asymptotically fill a region bounded by analytic arcs when the degree of the polynomial tau function tends to infinity and the other parameters are kept fixed. Moreover, we provide an approximate location of these roots within the region in terms of suitable quantization conditions.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet energy and focusing NLS condensates of minimal intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the family of (poly)continua $\K$ in the upper half-plane ${\mathbb H} $ that contain a preassigned finite {\it anchor} set $E\in\mathbb H$. For a given harmonic external field we define a Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ and show that within each ``connectivity class'' of the family, there exists a minimizing compact $\mathcal K^*$ consisting of critical trajectories of a quadratic differential. In many cases this quadratic differential coincides with the square of the real normalized quasimomentum differential ${\rm d} {\bf p}$ associated with the finite gap solutions of the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (fNLS) defined by a hyperelliptic Riemann surface $\mathfrak R$ branched at the points $E\cup\bar E$.
  The motivation for this work lies in the problem of soliton condensate of least average intensity such that a given anchor set $E$ belongs to the poly-continuum $\mathcal K$. An fNLS soliton condensate is defined by a compact $\mathcal K\subset{\mathbb H} $ (its spectral support) whereas the average intensity of the condensate is proportional to $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$. We prove that the spectral support $\mathcal K^*$ provides the fNLS soliton condensate of the least average intensity within a given ``connectivity class''.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Black Hole (BH) Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and Greybody Factors (GBFs) are key signatures of BH dynamics that are crucial for testing fundamental physics via gravitational waves. Recent studies of the BH pseudospectrum have revealed instabilities in QNMs. Here, we introduce a new perspective using hidden symmetries in the BH dynamics, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals - an infinite series of conserved quantities. By analyzing modified BH potentials, we find strong evidence that KdV integrals are valuable indicators for detecting instabilities in QNMs and GBFs.</description>
