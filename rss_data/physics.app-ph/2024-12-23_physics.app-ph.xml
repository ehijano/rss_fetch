      <title>Room-temperature Distributed Feedback CsPbBr$_3$ Perovskite Laser Integrated on a Silicon Nitride Waveguide Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs) require cost-effective laser sources that can be monolithically integrated. The low cost and low-temperature solution processability of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) make them attractive alternatives to established III-V compound semiconductors for on-chip laser sources in PICs. Cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) perovskites are emerging materials for green light-emitting diodes and lasers. To date, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at room temperature has been frequently achieved in CsPbBr$_3$ thin films, while reports on lasing are more limited. Here, we demonstrate a first-order grating distributed feedback (DFB) CsPbBr$_3$ thin-film laser operating at room temperature. Planar hot-pressed (PHP)-CsPbBr$_}$, with a low ASE threshold of 14.5 $\mu$Jcm$^{-2}$ under 0.3 nanosecond (ns) pump pulses, was monolithically integrated into a silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) waveguide platform via a compatible top-down patterning process. The first-order grating DFB PHP-CsPbBr$_3$ thin-film laser operated at 540 nm in the green spectral region, where III-V lasers have limitations, and exhibited a lasing threshold of 0.755 mJcm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. This work marks a significant step toward utilizing MHPs for on-chip green lasers in PICs for commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Mid-Air Single-Sided Acoustic Levitation in High-Pressure Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation is essential in many scientific and engineering applications to realize non-contact manipulation using sound waves. Traditional methods use standing waves from opposing sound sources, which limits manipulation to enclosed spaces. Single-sided levitation with twin traps has limited reach near phased array of transducers (\textless 66.7 mm). Herein, we introduce a new levitation mode and demonstrate stable levitation and translation between 141 and 397 mm from a phased array of transducers using a Bessel beam. The non-diffractive propagation characteristics of the Bessel beam, combined with its high central acoustic pressure, enable particles to be stably entrapped and manipulated within the high-pressure region of the beam. This work extends the reach of acoustic manipulation using a single-sided levitator.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of solid-state defect spins via patterned boron-doped diamond circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport characteristics of boron-doped diamond (BDD) across frequencies ranging from direct current to 3 GHz to explore the potential of BDD circuits as microwave waveguides. Three homoepitaxial BDD films with varying boron concentrations, exhibiting insulating to metallic properties, are fabricated on a single-crystalline diamond substrate containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. The $\Omega$-shaped BDD circuit demonstrates an approximately 30 $\Omega$ impedance at the resonance frequency of the NV center, facilitating the propagation of microwaves over the circuit, even with a standard 50 $\Omega$ reference impedance. We successfully perform optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on NV centers within diamonds using BDD circuits and observed continuous-wave ODMR spectra across all circuits. Additionally, we record Rabi oscillations in pulsed ODMR measurements using the metallic BDD circuit. The integration of NV centers with BDDs presents a compact, robust, and adaptable platform for quantum sensing in challenging environments and for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Coherent Interactions of Free Electrons and Matter: Toward Tunable Compact X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact laboratory-scale X-ray sources still rely on the same fundamental principles as in the first X-ray tubes developed more than a century ago. In recent years, significant research and development have focused on large-scale X-ray sources such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, leading to the generation of high-brightness coherent X-rays. However, the large size and high costs of such sources prevent their widespread use. The quest for a compact and coherent Xray source has long been a critical objective in modern physics, gaining further importance in recent years for industrial applications and fundamental scientific research. Here, we review the physical mechanisms governing compact coherent X-ray generation. Of current interest are coherent periodic interactions of free electrons in crystalline materials, creating hard X-rays via a mechanism known as parametric X-ray radiation (PXR). Over the past decade, X-ray sources leveraging this mechanism have demonstrated state-of-the-art tunability, directionality, and broad spatial coherence, enabling X-ray phase-contrast imaging on a compact scale. The coming years are expected to show substantial miniaturization of compact X-ray sources, facilitated by progress in electron beam technologies. This review compares the most promising mechanisms used for hard-X-ray generation, contrasting parametric X-ray radiation with inverse Compton scattering and characteristic radiation from a liquid-jet anode. We cover the most recent advancements, including the development of new materials, innovative geometrical designs, and specialized optimization techniques, aiming toward X-ray flux levels suitable for medical imaging and X-ray spectroscopy in compact scales.</description>

      <title>Identifying Switching of Antiferromagnets by Spin-Orbit Torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates for ultrafast spintronic applications, leveraging current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, experimentally distinguishing between different switching mechanisms of the staggered magnetization (N\'eel vector) driven by current pulses remains a challenge. In an exemplary study of the collinear antiferromagnetic compound Mn$_2$Au, we demonstrate that slower thermomagnetoelastic effects predominantly govern switching over a wide parameter range. In the regime of short current pulses in the nanosecond range, however, we observe fully N\'eel spin-orbit torque driven switching. We show that this ultrafast mechanism enables the complete directional alignment of the N\'eel vector by current pulses in device structures.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Interplay between Spin-Polarization and Magnetic Damping in $\mathrm{Co}_{x}\mathrm{Fe}_{80-x}\mathrm{B}_{20}$ for Magnonics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For magnonics and spintronics applications, the spin polarization ($P$) of a transport current and the magnetic damping ($\alpha$) play a crucial role, e.g. for magnetization dynamics and magnetization switching applications. In particular, $P$ in a glassy (amorphous) 3d transition ferromagnet such as CoFeB and $\alpha$ are both strongly affected by $s-d$ scattering mechanisms. Hence, a correlation can be expected which is a priori difficult to predict. In this work, $P$ and $\alpha$ are measured using current-induced Doppler shifts using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy and broadband ferromagnetic resonance techniques in blanket films and current-carrying $Co_{\rm x}Fe_{\rm {80-x}}B_{\rm 20}$ alloy microstrips. The measured $P$ ranges from 0.18 $\pm$ 0.05 to 0.39 $\pm$ 0.05 and $\alpha$ ranges from $(4.0\pm 0.2)\cdot10^{-3}$ to $(9.7\pm 0.6)\cdot10^{-3}$. We find that for increasing $P$ a systematic drop in $\alpha$ is observed, indicating an interplay between magnetic damping and the spin polarization of the transport current which suggests that interband scattering dominates in $Co_{\rm x}Fe_{\rm {80-x}}B_{\rm 20}$. Our results may guide future experiments, theory, and applications in advancing spintronics and metal magnonics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring MBE Growth of c-Mn3Sn Directly on MgO (111): From Islands to Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our study of (0001) oriented Mn$_3$Sn (c-Mn$_3$Sn) thin films synthesized directly on an MgO (111) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. We identify a growth window where Mn$_3$Sn growth can be controlled through slight adjustments of the Mn flux, achieving either $\mu$m$^2$-sized high crystalline-quality islands or an almost completely continuous film. High-resolution X-ray diffraction results indicate that both films are highly (0001) oriented. The atomic resolution images show clear film-substrate interfaces displaying an epitaxial relationship. Scanning precession electron diffraction measurements reveal that the island featured sample has highly crystallized Mn3Sn. The sample featuring a high continuity exhibits defects in some areas but retains the dominant Mn$_3$Sn structure. This work demonstrates a potential method for synthesizing high crystalline-quality Mn3Sn films with substantial coverage, facilitating the study of Mn3Sn films without the influence of an additional buffer layer and promoting their application in integrated spintronics.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Magnon Resonance Isolation in Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics is a promising field focusing the interaction between spin waves (magnons) and other types of signals. In cavity magnonics, the function of isolating magnons from the cavity to allow signal storage and processing fully in the magnonic domain is highly desired, but its realization is often hindered by the lack of necessary tunability on the interaction. This work shows that by utilizing the collective mode of two YIG spheres and adopting Floquet engineering, magnonic signals can be switched on-demand to a magnon dark mode that is protected from the environment, enabling a variety of manipulation over the magnon dynamics. Our demonstration can be scaled up to systems with an array of magnonic resonators, paving the way for large-scale programmable hybrid magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of Transverse Orientation Patterned Gallium Phosphide waveguides for high efficiency second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high conversion efficiencies in second-order nonlinear optical processes is a key challenge in integrated photonics for both classical and quantum applications. This paper presents the first demonstration of Transverse Orientation-Patterned gallium phosphide (TOP-GaP) waveguides showing high-efficiency second harmonic generation. In such devices, first order modal phase matching is unlocked and optimized through the inversion of the nonlinear susceptibility along the vertical direction. We discuss here the theory behind modal phase matching in TOP structures, describe the fabrication process, and present linear and nonlinear characterizations of the TOP-GaP waveguides.</description>

      <title>Electronic readout of optically excited surface plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging thermal losses as a useful consequence of surface plasmons in metal nanostructures has gained traction in recent years. This thermalization of hot electrons also induces a resistance change to an applied bias current, which we use to realize an all electronic readout of surface plasmons. The interplay of the plasmonic k-vector dependence and the applied bias current allows us to distinguish between linear polarizations of an incident laser beam for polarimetry and polarization imaging uses. This illustrates the potential applications this technique offers as a fully CMOS compatible plasmonic sensor. Moreover, we demonstrate an electronic signal that depends on the delay between two laser pulses on ultrafast timescales, providing insight into the highly non-equilibrium dynamics of the hot electron distribution inside the metal. Using an electronic approach to surface plasmons broadens access and simplifies existing applications, while simultaneously opening the door to new pathways for developing integrated sensors for processes on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Engineering high-Q superconducting tantalum microwave coplanar waveguide resonators for compact coherent quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently received considerable attention in manufacturing robust superconducting quantum circuits. Ta offers low microwave loss, high kinetic inductance compared to aluminium (Al) and niobium (Nb), and good compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which is essential for quantum computing applications. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication engineering of thickness-dependent high quality factor (high-Q_i) Ta superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators. All films are deposited on high-resistivity silicon substrates at room temperature without additional substrate heating. Before Ta deposition, a niobium (Nb) seed layer is used to ensure a body-centred cubic lattice ({\alpha}-Ta) formation. We further engineer the kinetic inductance (L_K) resonators by varying Ta film thicknesses. High L_K is a key advantage for applications because it facilitates the realisation of high-impedance, compact quantum circuits with enhanced coupling to qubits. The maximum internal quality factor Q_i of ~ 3.6 * 10^6 is achieved at the high power regime for 100 nm Ta, while the highest kinetic inductance is obtained to be 0.6 pH/sq for the thinnest film, which is 40 nm. This combination of high Q_i and high L_K highlights the potential of Ta microwave circuits for high-fidelity operations of compact quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Formulation and its Relationship with TARC and Maximum Power Transfer Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous framework for analyzing arbitrary passive matching networks using a generalized Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent circuit. Unlike prior formulations, which often impose restrictive assumptions such as diagonal matching impedance matrices, our approach accommodates fully passive and interconnected multiport matching networks in their most general form. We first establish the mathematical conditions that any Linear Time Invarient, LTI, passive matching network must satisfy, starting from a $N \times N$ impedance matrix and continuing to $2N \times 2N$ and modified to follow the Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent network. Using the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem (MPTT), we derive the scattering matrix $\mathbf{S}$ explicitly, showing its general applicability to arbitrary impedance configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the connection between the Total Active Reflection Coefficient (TARC) and the MPTT, proving that the TARC is inherently tied to the power conservation principle of the MPTT. This formulation not only unifies existing approaches, but also broadens the scope of applicability to encompass arbitrary physical passive systems. The equations and relationships derived provide a robust mathematical foundation for analyzing complex multiport systems, including interconnected phased arrays and passive antenna networks.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise plays a pivotal role in understanding quantum transport phenomena, including current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this domain is $\Delta_T$ noise, which arises due to a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. This paper investigates $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions with insulators, where the average charge current is zero at zero voltage bias, through the measurement of quantum shot noise, i.e., $\Delta_T$ noise. Notably, we find that the $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor junctions is significantly larger than in metal-insulator-metal junctions. Furthermore, our results reveal that $\Delta_T$ noise initially increases with barrier strength, peaks, and then decreases, while it shows a steady increase with temperature bias, highlighting the nuanced interplay between barrier characteristics and thermal gradients.</description>
