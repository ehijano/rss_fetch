      <title>From expNN to sinNN: automatic generation of sum-of-products models for potential energy surfaces in internal coordinates using neural networks and sparse grid sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential Energy Surfaces are generally required for simulating quantum dynamics. Specifically, having an analytical expression of the PES enables a more efficient dynamics workflow compared to the currently popular direct dynamics approaches. When using the MCTDH method, there is also a strong advantage to express the PES in sum-of-products form for solving the time-dependent nuclear Schr\"odinger equation. Nevertheless, obtaining an accurate expression for the PES of molecular systems that contain more than a few atoms presents challenges. The objectives of this work are twofold. First, the practicality of a single-layer artificial neural network with sinusoidal activation functions for representing potential energy surfaces in sum-of-products form will be evaluated. Second, the efficiency and ability of a homogeneous sampling strategy based on sparse grids to provide unbiased coverage of configuration space for generating training data will be assessed. The fitting approach, named sinNN, is applied to modeling the PES of HONO, covering both the trans and cis isomers. Refitting is first explored with comparison to the expNN fitting method. Second, fitting from potential energies obtained from the machine learning model MLatom/AIQM2 is considered. The sinNN PES model obtained from MLatom/AIQM2 energies was able to reproduce available experimental fundamental vibrational transition energies with a root mean square error of about 17 cm-1. sinNN combined with sparse grids sampling approach proves to be of practical use for the chosen system, both at refitting and direct fitting tasks. The ability of MLatom/AIQM models to accurately reproduce global PESs beyond equilibrium geometries is of particular interest.</description>

      <title>Imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on a torus and on a pair of balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a general spectral approach based on the Steklov eigenbasis to describe imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on bounded reactive targets in three dimensions. The steady-state concentration and the total diffusive flux onto the target are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the exterior Steklov problem. In particular, the eigenvalues are shown to provide the geometric lengthscales of the target that are relevant for diffusion-controlled reactions. Using toroidal and bispherical coordinates, we propose an efficient procedure for analyzing and solving numerically this spectral problem for an arbitrary torus and a pair of balls, respectively. A simple two-term approximation for the diffusive flux is established and validated. Implications of these results in the context of chemical physics and beyond are discussed.</description>

      <title>Effect of eccentric mixing parameters on chaotic characteristics and mixing time for viscous liquid based on sound decibels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric mixing is a typical chaotic mixing method, and the study of its mixing characteristics is beneficial to the optimization of the mixing process. In this study, the effects of eccentricity (E/R) and rotational speed (N) on the mixing time are quantified through tracer staining experiments and image grayscale analysis, and the method of calculating the Lyapunov exponent (LLE) based on the sound decibel value time series is proposed. Experiments show that sound decibel value time series can better characterize the chaotic dynamics of the system. Based on the control variable method, the mixing time and LLE all show a nonlinear trend of decreasing and then increasing, or increasing and then decreasing, with the increase of eccentricity and rotational speed. When E/R=0.4 and the rotational speed N=450rpm, the mixing time was shortened by 48% compared with the center mixing, and the degree of chaos reached the peak. The dimensionless chaos indicator model is further constructed to reveal the quantitative relationship between the eccentric stirring parameters and the chaos intensity. This method provides a theoretical basis for the real-time monitoring of the chaotic characteristics of complex flow fields and the optimization of industrial mixing equipment.</description>

      <title>Reducing Weighted Ensemble Variance With Optimal Trajectory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted ensemble (WE) is an enhanced path-sampling method that is conceptually simple, widely applicable, and statistically exact. In a WE simulation, an ensemble of trajectories is periodically pruned or replicated to enhance sampling of rare transitions and improve estimation of mean first passage times (MFPTs). However, poor choices of the parameters governing pruning and replication can lead to high-variance MFPT estimates. Our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 014108 (2023)] presented an optimal WE parameterization strategy and applied it in low-dimensional example systems. The strategy harnesses estimated local MFPTs from different initial configurations to a single target state. In the present work, we apply the optimal parameterization strategy to more challenging, high-dimensional molecular models, namely, synthetic molecular dynamics (MD) models of Trp-cage folding and unfolding, as well as atomistic MD models of NTL9 folding in high-friction and low-friction continuum solvents. In each system we use WE to estimate the MFPT for folding or unfolding events. We show that the optimal parameterization reduces the variance of MFPT estimates in three of four systems, with dramatic improvement in the most challenging atomistic system. Overall, the parameterization strategy improves the accuracy and reliability of WE estimates for the kinetics of biophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Rovibrational computation of H$_3^+$ with permutationally invariant Pekeris coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pekeris coordinates provide a permutationally invariant set of coordinates for H$_3^+$. They are defined as the linear combination of the three internuclear distances that automatically fulfils the triangle inequality for all non-negative coordinate values. In this work, we test three discrete variable representations (DVR) for tightly converging the rovibrational energies up to and beyond the barrier to linearity using the Pekeris coordinates. The best performing representation is a cot-DVR-type approach adapted to the Pekeris problem. The two- and three-proton near coalescence region, which is also part of the direct product Pekeris grid but dynamically not relevant, is avoided by coordinate mapping.</description>

      <title>Monolayer C$_{60}$ networks: A first-principles perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer fullerene (C$_{60}$) networks combine molecular-level rigidity with crystalline connectivity, offering a promising platform for numerous applications. In this Feature article, we review the physical and chemical properties of fullerene monolayers, focusing on first-principles studies. We first explore the structural stability of monolayer phases and investigate their thermal expansion behaviours. We then outline criteria for photocatalytic water splitting and introduce theoretical predictions which are supported by recent experimental verification. Finally, we show how interlayer stacking, molecular size, and dimensional tuning (from 2D monolayers into 3D crystals, 1D chains, or nanoribbons) offer versatile approaches to modulate their chemical functionality. Together, these insights establish fullerene networks as a novel class of carbon-based materials with tailored properties for catalysis, photovoltaics, and flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Steering reaction flux by coupling product channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for controlling the outcome of an ultracold chemical few-body reaction by redirecting a tunable fraction of reaction flux from one selected product channel to another one. In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment.</description>

      <title>Egret-1: Pretrained Neural Network Potentials For Efficient and Accurate Bioorganic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of atomic systems has the potential to revolutionize the design of molecules and materials. Unfortunately, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation scale as O(N!) and remain inaccessible for systems with more than a handful of atoms, forcing scientists to accept steep tradeoffs between speed and accuracy and limiting the reliability and utility of the resultant simulations. Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that neural network potentials (NNPs) can learn efficient approximations to quantum mechanics and resolve this tradeoff, but existing NNPs still suffer from limited accuracy relative to state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methods. Here, we present Egret-1, a family of large pretrained NNPs based on the MACE architecture with general applicability to main-group, organic, and biomolecular chemistry. We find that the Egret-1 models equal or exceed the accuracy of routinely employed quantum-chemical methods on a variety of standard tasks, including torsional scans, conformer ranking, and geometry optimization, while offering multiple-order-of-magnitude speedups relative to legacy methods. We also highlight important lacunae for future NNP research to investigate, and suggest strategies for building future high-quality models with increased scale and generality.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and modal expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>
