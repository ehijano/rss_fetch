      <title>Determining sensor geometry and gain in a wearable MEG system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</description>

      <title>FlowMRI-Net: A generalizable self-supervised physics-driven 4D Flow MRI reconstruction network for aortic and cerebrovascular applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08856v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose FlowMRI-Net, a novel deep learning-based framework for fast reconstruction of accelerated 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using physics-driven unrolled optimization and a complexvalued convolutional recurrent neural network trained in a self-supervised manner. The generalizability of the framework is evaluated using aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI acquisitions acquired on systems from two different vendors for various undersampling factors (R=8,16,24) and compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS-LLR) and deep learning-based (FlowVN) reconstructions. Evaluation includes quantitative analysis of image magnitudes, velocity magnitudes, and peak velocity curves. FlowMRINet outperforms CS-LLR and FlowVN for aortic 4D flow MRI reconstruction, resulting in vectorial normalized root mean square errors of $0.239\pm0.055$, $0.308\pm0.066$, and $0.302\pm0.085$ and mean directional errors of $0.023\pm0.015$, $0.036\pm0.018$, and $0.039\pm0.025$ for velocities in the thoracic aorta for R=16, respectively. Furthermore, FlowMRI-Net outperforms CS-LLR for cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI reconstruction, where no FlowVN can be trained due to the lack of a highquality reference, resulting in a consistent increase in SNR of around 6 dB and more accurate peak velocity curves for R=8,16,24. Reconstruction times ranged from 1 to 7 minutes on commodity CPU/GPU hardware. FlowMRI-Net enables fast and accurate quantification of aortic and cerebrovascular flow dynamics, with possible applications to other vascular territories. This will improve clinical adaptation of 4D flow MRI and hence may aid in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Cyclic jetting enables microbubble-mediated drug delivery</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of targeted therapies capable of overcoming biological barriers, including the tenacious blood-brain barrier, has spurred the investigation into stimuli-responsive microagents. This approach could improve therapeutic efficacy, reduce undesirable side effects, and open avenues for treating previously incurable diseases. Intravenously-administered ultrasound-responsive microbubbles are one of the most promising agents, having demonstrated potential in several clinical trials. However, the mechanism by which microbubbles enhance drug absorption remains unclear. Here, we reveal through unprecedented time-resolved side-view visualisations that single microbubbles, upon microsecond-long ultrasound driving, puncture the cell membrane and induce drug uptake via stable cyclic microjets. Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, warranting recognition as a novel class of jets in bubbles, distinct from classical inertial jets driven by pressure gradients. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation. Remarkably, these microjets occur at ultrasound pressures below 100 kPa due to their unique formation mechanism. We show that the stress generated by microjetting surpasses all previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude. In summary, this work elucidates the physics behind microbubble-mediated targeted drug delivery and provides criteria for its effective yet safe application.</description>

      <title>Proton Computed Tomography Based on Richardson-Lucy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Proton therapy is an emerging method in cancer therapy. One of the main developments is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP) measurements. An excellent choice is the application of proton computed tomography (pCT) systems which takes the images under similar conditions, as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging and treatment. A key aim is to develop an precise image reconstruction algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance. Approach: An image reconstruction algorithm was developed in this work, which is suitable to reconstruct pCT images from the deposited energy, position and direction measurement of individual protons. The flexibility of an iterative image reconstruction algorithm was utilised to appropriately model the trajectory of protons. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a Derenzo and a CTP404 phantom was used to test the accuracy of the image reconstruction. Main results: The Richardson-Lucy algorithm was applied first and successfully for pCT image reconstruction. Authors used an averaged probability density based approach for the interaction (system) matrix generation, which is a relevant description to consider the uncertainty of the path of the protons in the patient. In case of an idealized setup, 1.43 lp/cm spatial resolution and 0.3% RSP accuracy was achieved. Significance: This work is the first application of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, for pCT image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Material Properties of Popular Radiation Detection Scintillator Crystals for Optical Physics Transport Modelling in Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation detection is vital for space, medical imaging, homeland security, and environmental monitoring applications. In the past, the Monte Carlo radiation transport toolkit, Geant4, has been employed to enable the effective development of emerging technologies in these fields. Radiation detectors utilising scintillator crystals have benefited from Geant4; however, Geant4 optical physics parameters for scintillator crystal modelling are sparse. This work outlines scintillator properties for GAGG:Ce, CLLBC:Ce, BGO, NaI:Tl, and CsI:Tl. These properties were implemented in a detailed SiPM-based single-volume scintillation detector simulation platform developed in this work. It was validated by its comparison to experimental measurements. For all five scintillation materials, the platform successfully predicted the spectral features for selected gamma ray emitting isotopes with energies between 30 keV to 2 MeV. The full width half maximum (FWHM) and normalised cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) between simulated and experimental energy spectra were also compared. The majority of simulated FWHM values reproduced the experimental results within a 2% difference, and the majority of NCCC values demonstrated agreement between the simulated and experimental energy spectra. Discrepancies in these figures of merit were attributed to detector signal processing electronics modelling and geometry approximations within the detector and surrounding experimental environment.</description>
