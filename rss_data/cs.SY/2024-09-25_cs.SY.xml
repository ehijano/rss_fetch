      <title>Spectral Graph Theoretic Methods for Enhancing Network Robustness in Robot Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization of edge-weighted networks by maximizing algebraic connectivity to enhance network robustness. Motivated by the need for precise robot position estimation in cooperative localization and pose-graph sparsification in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), the algebraic connectivity maximization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Semi-Definite Program (MISDP), which is NP-hard. Leveraging spectral graph theoretic methods, specifically Cheeger's inequality, this work introduces novel "Cheeger cuts" to strengthen and efficiently solve medium-scale MISDPs. Further, a new Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) is developed for efficiently computing Cheeger cuts, implemented within an outer-approximation algorithm for solving the MISDP. A greedy k-opt heuristic is also presented, producing high-quality solutions that serve as valid lower bounds for Cheeger cuts. Comprehensive numerical analyses demonstrate the efficacy of strengthened cuts via substantial improvements in run times on synthetic and realistic robot localization datasets.</description>

      <title>Agent-state based policies in POMDPs: Beyond belief-state MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional approach to POMDPs is to convert them into fully observed MDPs by considering a belief state as an information state. However, a belief-state based approach requires perfect knowledge of the system dynamics and is therefore not applicable in the learning setting where the system model is unknown. Various approaches to circumvent this limitation have been proposed in the literature. We present a unified treatment of some of these approaches by viewing them as models where the agent maintains a local recursively updateable agent state and chooses actions based on the agent state. We highlight the different classes of agent-state based policies and the various approaches that have been proposed in the literature to find good policies within each class. These include the designer's approach to find optimal non-stationary agent-state based policies, policy search approaches to find a locally optimal stationary agent-state based policies, and the approximate information state to find approximately optimal stationary agent-state based policies. We then present how ideas from the approximate information state approach have been used to improve Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms for learning in POMDPs.</description>

      <title>Open-/Closed-loop Active Learning for Data-driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important question in data-driven control is how to obtain an informative dataset. In this work, we consider the problem of effective data acquisition of an unknown linear system with bounded disturbance for both open-loop and closed-loop stages. The learning objective is to minimize the volume of the set of admissible systems. First, a performance measure based on historical data and the input sequence is introduced to characterize the upper bound of the volume of the set of admissible systems. On the basis of this performance measure, an open-loop active learning strategy is proposed to minimize the volume by actively designing inputs during the open-loop stage. For the closed-loop stage, an closed-loop active learning strategy is designed to select and learn from informative closed-loop data. The efficiency of the proposed closed-loop active learning strategy is proved by showing that the unselected data cannot benefit the learning performance. Furthermore, an adaptive predictive controller is designed in accordance with the proposed data acquisition approach. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the controller are proved by analyzing the effect of the closed-loop active learning strategy. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed data acquisition strategy.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Leaning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for massive-scale systems consisting of large populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments has witnessed a significant surge in recent years across diverse scientific domains. However, due to the large-scale nature of the system, the majority of state-of-the-art RL techniques either encounter high computational cost or exhibit compromised performance. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture along with the derivation of effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for any arbitrarily large system of agents. Specifically, we model such a system as a parameterized control system defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform to map the parameterized system and the value function of an RL problem into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation subsequently generates a finite-dimensional moment representation for this RL problem. Leveraging this representation, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. We further enhance efficiency of the algorithm by exploiting early stopping at each hierarchy, by which we show the fast convergence property of the algorithm through constructing a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose novel global and regional stability analysis conditions based on linear matrix inequalities for a general class of recurrent neural networks. These conditions can be also used for state-feedback control design and a suitable optimization problem enforcing H2 norm minimization properties is defined.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are vital in modern traffic management and optimization, significantly enhancing traffic efficiency and safety. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as transformative tools for addressing complex challenges within ITS. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of diffusion models for ITS, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. First, we introduce the theoretical foundations of diffusion models and their key variants, including conditional diffusion models and latent diffusion models, highlighting their suitability for modeling complex, multi-modal traffic data and enabling controllable generation. Second, we outline the primary challenges in ITS and the corresponding advantages of diffusion models, providing readers with a deeper understanding of the intersection between ITS and diffusion models. Third, we offer a multi-perspective investigation of current applications of diffusion models in ITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, trajectory prediction, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion model techniques and highlight key ITS research directions that warrant further investigation. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for ITS, thereby advancing their future applications in the transportation domain.</description>

      <title>Identification For Control Based on Neural Networks: Approximately Linearizable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a control-oriented identification scheme for efficient control design and stability analysis of nonlinear systems. Neural networks are used to identify a discrete-time nonlinear state-space model to approximate time-domain input-output behavior of a nonlinear system. The network is constructed such that the identified model is approximately linearizable by feedback, ensuring that the control law trivially follows from the learning stage. After the identification and quasi-linearization procedures, linear control theory comes at hand to design robust controllers and study stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness and interest of the methodology are illustrated throughout the paper on popular benchmarks for system identification.</description>

      <title>Robust Neural IDA-PBC: passivity-based stabilization under approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we restructure the Neural Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity Based Control (Neural IDA-PBC) design methodology, and we formally analyze its closed-loop properties. Neural IDA-PBC redefines the IDA-PBC design approach as an optimization problem by building on the framework of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, the closed-loop stability and robustness properties under Neural IDA-PBC remain unexplored. To address the issue, we study the behavior of classical IDA-PBC under approximations. Our theoretical analysis allows deriving conditions for practical and asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium point. Moreover, it extends the Neural IDA-PBC applicability to port-Hamiltonian systems where the matching conditions cannot be solved exactly. Our renewed optimization-based design introduces three significant aspects: i) it involves a novel optimization objective including stability and robustness constraints issued from our theoretical analysis; ii) it employs separate Neural Networks (NNs), which can be structured to reduce the search space to relevant functions; iii) it does not require knowledge about the port-Hamiltonian formulation of the system's model. Our methodology is validated with simulations on three standard benchmarks: a double pendulum, a nonlinear mass-spring-damper and a cartpole. Notably, classical IDA-PBC designs cannot be analytically derived for the latter.</description>

      <title>Safe Output Feedback Improvement with Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data-driven control design, an important problem is to deal with uncertainty due to limited and noisy data. One way to do this is to use a min-max approach, which aims to minimize some design criteria for the worst-case scenario. However, a strategy based on this approach can lead to overly conservative controllers. To overcome this issue, we apply the idea of baseline regret, and it is seen that minimizing the baseline regret under model uncertainty can guarantee safe controller improvement with less conservatism and variance in the resulting controllers. To exemplify the use of baseline controllers, we focus on the output feedback setting and propose a two-step control design method; first, an uncertainty set is constructed by a data-driven system identification approach based on finite impulse response models; then a control design criterion based on model reference control is used. To solve the baseline regret optimization problem efficiently, we use a convex approximation of the criterion and apply the scenario approach in optimization. The numerical examples show that the inclusion of baseline regret indeed improves the performance and reduces the variance of the resulting controller.</description>

      <title>Assessing strategies to manage distributed photovoltaics in Swiss low-voltage networks: An analysis of curtailment, export tariffs, and resource sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of photovoltaic systems poses several challenges for the distribution grid, mainly due to the infrastructure not being designed to handle the upstream flow and being dimensioned for consumption only, potentially leading to reliability and stability issues. This study investigates the use of capacity-based tariffs, export tariffs, and curtailment policies to reduce negative grid impacts without hampering PV deployment. We analyze the effect of such export tariffs on three typical Swiss low-voltage networks (rural, semi-urban, and urban), using power flow analysis to evaluate the power exchanges at the transformer station, as well as line overloading and voltage violations. Finally, a simple case of mutualization of resources is analyzed to assess its potential contribution to relieving network constraints and the economic costs of managing LV networks. We found that the tariff with capacity-based components on the export (CT export daily) severely penalizes PV penetration. This applies to other tariffs as well (e.g. IRR monthly, Curtailment 30, and DT variable) but to a lesser extent. However, the inclusion of curtailment at 50\% and 70\%, as well as mixed tariffs with capacity-based components at import and curtailment, allow for a high degree of PV installations in the three zones studied and help to mitigate the impact of PV on the distributed network.</description>

      <title>Wind lulls and slews; consequences for the stability of future UK electricity systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the United Kingdom wind fleet increases in size, wind lulls and slews will increasingly challenge the stability of its electricity system. The paper describes the use of models based on real time records and including solar slews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered in future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are surprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always likely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to mitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas powered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs are not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews anticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven fast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs) and stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the largest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035. Examples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of generation which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind and solar fleets increase in size. Moreover, we see the pattern of recent investments, summarised in the paper, as a good indication of likely future investments, with OCGT investments mainly serving the 440 kV grid, and ICGRs and stored electrical energy more local networks.</description>

      <title>Mean Age of Information in Partial Offloading Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age of information (AoI) performance analysis is essential for evaluating the information freshness in the large-scale mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. This work proposes the earliest analysis of the mean AoI (MAoI) performance of large-scale partial offloading MEC networks. Firstly, we derive and validate the closed-form expressions of MAoI by using queueing theory and stochastic geometry. Based on these expressions, we analyse the effects of computing offloading ratio (COR) and task generation rate (TGR) on the MAoI performance and compare the MAoI performance under the local computing, remote computing, and partial offloading schemes. The results show that by jointly optimising the COR and TGR, the partial offloading scheme outperforms the local and remote computing schemes in terms of the MAoI, which can be improved by up to 51% and 61%, respectively. This encourages the MEC networks to adopt the partial offloading scheme to improve the MAoI performance.</description>

      <title>System-Level Performance Metrics Sensitivity of an Electrified Heavy-Duty Mobile Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift to electric and hybrid powertrains in vehicular systems has propelled advancements in mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles. This paper examines the sensitivity of key performance metrics in a electrified heavy-duty mobile manipulator (HDMM) driven by electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs) powered by permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). The study evaluates power delivery, force dynamics, energy consumption, and overall efficiency of the actuation mechanisms. By computing partial derivatives (PD) with respect to the payload mass at the tool center point (TCP), it provides insights into these factors under various loading conditions. This research aids in the appropriate choice or design of EMLAs for HDMM electrification, addressing actuation mechanism selection challenge in vehicular system with mounted manipulator and determines the necessary battery capacity requirements.</description>

      <title>A Critical Review of Safe Reinforcement Learning Techniques in Smart Grid Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in modern smart power systems introduces unforeseen uncertainties for the electricity sector, leading to increased complexity and difficulty in the operation and control of power systems. As a cutting-edge machine learning technology, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely implemented in recent years to handle the uncertainty in power systems. However, in critical infrastructures such as power systems, safety issues always receive top priority, while DRL may not always meet the safety requirements of power system operators. The concept of safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) is emerging as a potential solution to overcome the shortcomings of conventional DRL in the operation and control of power systems. This study provides a rigorous review of the latest research efforts focused on safe RL to derive power system control policies while accounting for the unique safety requirements of power grids. Furthermore, this study highlights various safe RL algorithms applied in diverse applications within the power system sector, from single grid-connected power converters, residential smart homes, and buildings to large power distribution networks. For all methods outlined, a discussion on their bottlenecks, research challenges, and potential opportunities in the operation and control of power system applications is also presented. This review aims to support research in the area of safe RL algorithms, embracing smart power system operation with safety constraints amid high uncertainty from DERs.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Verification of Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions: A Branch-and-Bound Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) form a powerful control theoretic tool to guarantee safety and synthesize safe controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. In this paper, we provide an optimization-based algorithm, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of a candidate DTCBF, i.e., either verifying a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifying it by providing a counterexample for a general nonlinear discrete-time system with input constraints. This method is applicable whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We apply our method to a numerical case study to illustrate its efficacy.</description>

      <title>LDPC Codes in Cooperative Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fact, the broadcast nature of every transmitter makes it possible for other transceivers in the channel to overhear the broadcasted signal. The proposed idea in cooperative communication is to use these intermediate transceivers as relay for the transmitted signal, therefore we will have spatial diversity which can improve throughput and received data reliability in the system. In this dissertation we consider some important aspects of cooperative communication in a network composed of three nodes. First, we verify the increase of reliability for the received signal by comparing the reliability of the received bits in a cooperative network with a non-cooperative one. Then we step forward and use LDPC error correction technique to improve the reliability of the received bits even more and compare it with a network without LDPC codes (encoder and decoder) to measure the level of improvement for different SNRs. The overall aim of this dissertation is to deploy cooperative communication idea to consider and test its claimed aspects and also enhance its performance by using LDPC error correction technique.</description>

      <title>Autotuning Bipedal Locomotion MPC with GRFM-Net for Efficient Sim-to-Real Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipedal locomotion control is essential for humanoid robots to navigate complex, human-centric environments. While optimization-based control designs are popular for integrating sophisticated models of humanoid robots, they often require labor-intensive manual tuning. In this work, we address the challenges of parameter selection in bipedal locomotion control using DiffTune, a model-based autotuning method that leverages differential programming for efficient parameter learning. A major difficulty lies in balancing model fidelity with differentiability. We address this difficulty using a low-fidelity model for differentiability, enhanced by a Ground Reaction Force-and-Moment Network (GRFM-Net) to capture discrepancies between MPC commands and actual control effects. We validate the parameters learned by DiffTune with GRFM-Net in hardware experiments, which demonstrates the parameters' optimality in a multi-objective setting compared with baseline parameters, reducing the total loss by up to 40.5$\%$ compared with the expert-tuned parameters. The results confirm the GRFM-Net's effectiveness in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, improving the transferability of simulation-learned parameters to real hardware.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Wheel Loader Navigation Using Goal-Conditioned Actor-Critic MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control method for an autonomous wheel loader, enabling time-efficient navigation to an arbitrary goal pose. Unlike prior works that combine high-level trajectory planners with Model Predictive Control (MPC), we directly enhance the planning capabilities of MPC by integrating a cost function derived from Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we train an RL agent to solve the pose reaching task in simulation, then incorporate the trained neural network critic as both the stage and terminal cost of an MPC. We show through comprehensive simulations that the resulting MPC inherits the time-efficient behavior of the RL agent, generating trajectories that compare favorably against those found using trajectory optimization. We also deploy our method on a real wheel loader, where we successfully navigate to various goal poses. In contrast, the RL actor risked damaging the machine and was unsuitable for real-world use.</description>

      <title>Optimization of partially isolated quantum harmonic oscillator memory systems by mean square decoherence time criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum harmonic oscillators with position-momentum system variables, whose internal dynamics and interaction with the environment are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations. A recently proposed approach to such systems as Heisenberg picture quantum memories exploits their ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a decoherence horizon. Using the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation of the system variables from their initial values, we apply this approach to a partially isolated subsystem of the oscillator, which is not directly affected by the external fields. The partial isolation leads to an appropriate system decomposition and a qualitatively different short-horizon asymptotic behaviour of the deviation, which yields a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit. The resulting approximate decoherence time maximization over the energy parameters for improving the quantum memory performance is discussed for a coherent feedback interconnection of such systems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in Federated Learning for Remote Industry 4.0 Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) models are effective solutions for industry 4.0 applications (\eg oil spill detection, fire detection, anomaly detection). However, training a DNN network model needs a considerable amount of data collected from various sources and transferred to the central cloud server that can be expensive and sensitive to privacy. For instance, in the remote offshore oil field where network connectivity is vulnerable, a federated fog environment can be a potential computing platform. Hence it is feasible to perform computation within the federation. On the contrary, performing a DNN model training using fog systems poses a security issue that the federated learning (FL) technique can resolve. In this case, the new challenge is the class imbalance problem that can be inherited in local data sets and can degrade the performance of the global model. Therefore, FL training needs to be performed considering the class imbalance problem locally. In addition, an efficient technique to select the relevant worker model needs to be adopted at the global level to increase the robustness of the global model. Accordingly, we utilize one of the suitable loss functions addressing the class imbalance in workers at the local level. In addition, we employ a dynamic threshold mechanism with user-defined worker's weight to efficiently select workers for aggregation that improve the global model's robustness. Finally, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation to explore the benefits of our solution and find up to 3-5% performance improvement than baseline federated learning methods.</description>

      <title>Whole-body end-effector pose tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining manipulation with the mobility of legged robots is essential for a wide range of robotic applications. However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system's complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm's workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot's initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot's operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64 degrees, outperforming existing competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>TE-PINN: Quaternion-Based Orientation Estimation using Transformer-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Transformer-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Network (TE-PINN) designed for accurate quaternion-based orientation estimation in high-dynamic environments, particularly within the field of robotics. By integrating transformer networks with physics-informed learning, our approach innovatively captures temporal dependencies in sensor data while enforcing the fundamental physical laws governing rotational motion. TE-PINN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to handle sequential data from inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, ensuring temporal consistency. Simultaneously, the model embeds quaternion kinematics and rigid body dynamics into the learning process, aligning the network's predictions with mechanical principles like Euler's laws of motion. The physics-informed loss function incorporates the dynamics of angular velocity and external forces, enhancing the network's ability to generalize in complex scenarios. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that TE-PINN consistently outperforms traditional methods such as Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and LSTM-based estimators, particularly in scenarios characterized by high angular velocities and noisy sensor data. The results show a significant reduction in mean quaternion error and improved gyroscope bias estimation compared to the state-of-the-art. An ablation study further isolates the contributions of both the transformer architecture and the physics-informed constraints, highlighting the synergistic effect of both components in improving model performance. The proposed model achieves real-time performance on embedded systems typical of mobile robots, offering a scalable and efficient solution for orientation estimation in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip in Networks with Multiple Views of a Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the version age of information (AoI) in a network where a subset of nodes act as sensing nodes, sampling a source that in general can follow a continuous distribution. Any sample of the source constitutes a new version of the information and the version age of the information is defined with respect to the most recent version of the information available for the whole network. We derive a recursive expression for the average version AoI between different subsets of the nodes which can be used to evaluate the average version AoI for any subset of the nodes including any single node. We derive asymptotic behavior of the average AoI on any single node of the network for various topologies including line, ring, and fully connected networks. The prior art result on version age of a network by Yates [ISIT'21] can be interpreted as in our derivation as a network with a single view of the source, e.g., through a Poisson process with rate $\lambda_{00}$. Our result indicates that there is no loss in the average version AoI performance by replacing a single view of the source with distributed sensing across multiple nodes by splitting the same rate $\lambda_{00}$. Particularly, we show that asymptotically, the average AoI scales with $O(\log(n))$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for fully connected and ring networks, respectively. More interestingly, we show that for the ring network the same $O(\sqrt{n})$ asymptotical performance on average AoI is still achieved with distributed sensing if the number of sensing nodes only scales with $O(\sqrt{n})$ instead of prior known result which requires $O(n)$. Our results indicate that the sensing nodes can be arbitrarily chosen as long as the maximum number of consecutive non-sensing nodes also scales as $O(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

Abstract: As Machine Learning grows in popularity across various fields, equity has become a key focus for the AI community. However fairness-oriented approaches are still underexplored in smart mobility. Addressing this gap, our study investigates the balance between performance optimization and algorithmic fairness in shared micromobility services providing a novel framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Exploiting Q-Learning, the proposed methodology achieves equitable outcomes in terms of the Gini index across different areas characterized by their distance from central hubs. Through vehicle rebalancing, the provided scheme maximizes operator performance while ensuring fairness principles for users, reducing iniquity by up to 80% while only increasing costs by 30% (w.r.t. applying no equity adjustment). A case study with synthetic data validates our insights and highlights the importance of fairness in urban micromobility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time).</description>

      <title>Data-Driven System Identification of Quadrotors Subject to Motor Delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently non-linear control methods like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have attracted increased interest in the quadrotor control community. In contrast to classic control methods like cascaded PID controllers, MPC and RL heavily rely on an accurate model of the system dynamics. The process of quadrotor system identification is notoriously tedious and is often pursued with additional equipment like a thrust stand. Furthermore, low-level details like motor delays which are crucial for accurate end-to-end control are often neglected. In this work, we introduce a data-driven method to identify a quadrotor's inertia parameters, thrust curves, torque coefficients, and first-order motor delay purely based on proprioceptive data. The estimation of the motor delay is particularly challenging as usually, the RPMs can not be measured. We derive a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)-based method to estimate the latent time constant. Our approach only requires about a minute of flying data that can be collected without any additional equipment and usually consists of three simple maneuvers. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to accurately recover the parameters of multiple quadrotors. It also facilitates the deployment of RL-based, end-to-end quadrotor control of a large quadrotor under harsh, outdoor conditions.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are valuable for ocean exploration due to their flexibility and ability to carry communication and detection units. Nevertheless, AUVs alone often face challenges in harsh and extreme sea conditions. This study introduces a unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-AUV collaboration framework, which includes high-precision multi-AUV positioning using USV path planning via Fisher information matrix optimization and reinforcement learning for multi-AUV cooperative tasks. Applied to a multi-AUV underwater data collection task scenario, extensive simulations validate the framework's feasibility and superior performance, highlighting exceptional coordination and robustness under extreme sea conditions. To accelerate relevant research in this field, we have made the simulation code available as open-source.</description>

Abstract: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</description>
