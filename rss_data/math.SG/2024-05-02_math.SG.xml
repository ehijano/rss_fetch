      <title>High-dimensional families of holomorphic curves and three-dimensional energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H: \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}$ be any smooth function. This article introduces some arguments for extracting dynamical information about the Hamiltonian flow of $H$ from high-dimensional families of closed holomorphic curves. We work in a very general setting, without imposing convexity or contact-type assumptions. For any compact regular level set $Y$, we prove that the Hamiltonian flow admits an infinite family of pairwise distinct, proper, compact invariant subsets whose union is dense in $Y$. This is a generalization of the Fish-Hofer theorem, which showed that $Y$ has at least one proper compact invariant subset. We then establish a global Le Calvez-Yoccoz property for almost every compact regular level set $Y$: any compact invariant subset containing all closed orbits is either equal to $Y$ or is not locally maximal. Next, we prove quantitative versions, in four dimensions, of the celebrated almost-existence theorem for Hamiltonian systems; such questions have been open for general Hamiltonians since the late $1980$s. We prove that almost every compact regular level set of $H$ contains at least two closed orbits, a sharp lower bound. Under explicit and $C^\infty$-generic conditions on $H$, we prove almost-existence of infinitely many closed orbits.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantization Without Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expound upon our (polarization-free) definition of the quantization map in geometric quantization, which is justified using the Poisson sigma model and pieces together most known quantization schemes. We use it to obtain the noncommutative torus and a finite dimensional irreducible representation. We discuss invariance of polarization using Schur's lemma.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian systems with energy and power ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the port-Hamiltonian framework defined with respect to a Lagrangian submanifold and a Dirac structure by augmenting the Lagrangian submanifold with the space of external variables. The new pair of conjugated variables is called energy port. We show that in the most general case, the extension describes constrained Hamiltonian systems whose Hamiltonian function depends on inputs.</description>

      <title>Framed $E^2$ structures in Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the long-standing problem of constructing the action of the operad of framed (stable) genus-$0$ curves on Hamiltonian Floer theory; this operad is equivalent to the framed $E_2$ operad. We formulate the construction in the following general context: we associate to each compact subset of a closed symplectic manifold a new chain-level model for (relative) symplectic cohomology, which we show carries an action of a model for the chains on the moduli space of framed genus-$0$ curves. This construction turns out to be strictly functorial with respect to inclusions of subsets, and the action of the symplectomorphism group. In the general context, we appeal to virtual fundamental chain methods to construct the operations over fields of characteristic $0$, and we give a separate account, over arbitrary rings, in the special settings where Floer's classical transversality approach can be applied. We perform all constructions over the Novikov ring, so that the algebraic structures we produce are compatible with the quantitative information that is contained in Floer theory. Over fields of characteristic $0$, our construction can be combined with results in the theory of operads to produce explicit operations encoding the structure of a homotopy $BV$ algebra. In an appendix, we explain how to extend the results of the paper from the class of closed symplectic manifolds to geometrically bounded ones.</description>

      <title>Floer-type bipersistence modules and rectangle barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the pointwise finite-dimensional two-parameter persistence module $\mathbb{HF}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$, defined in terms of interlevel filtered Floer homology, is rectangle-decomposable. This allows for the definition of a barcode $\mathcal{B}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$ consisting only of rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ associated with $\mathbb{HF}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$. We observe that this rectangle barcode contains information about Usher's boundary depth and spectral invariants developed by Oh, Schwarz, and Viterbo. Moreover, we introduce a novel invariant extracted from $\mathcal{B}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$, which proves instrumental in detecting periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we establish relevant stability results, particularly concerning the bottleneck distance and Hofer's distance.</description>
