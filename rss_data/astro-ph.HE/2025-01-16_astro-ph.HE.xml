      <title>Complete Hamiltonian Framework of Relativistic Hierarchical Triple Systems: Capabilities and Limitations of Secular Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic secular perturbation theory has ignited significant interest in uncovering intricate cross-term effects, especially the interplay between 1PN and quadrupole terms. While most existing studies rely on the Lagrangian planetary perturbation method for computing cross terms, a comprehensive Hamiltonian framework for the field has been missing. In this work, we introduce a framework based on von Zeipel transformation, utilizing two sequential canonical transformations to systematically compute cross terms to arbitrary orders. Our results reveal secular cross terms up to quadrupole-squared order, showcasing remarkable consistency with both the Lagrangian method [1] and the effective-field-theory approach [2]. We present leading-order periodic cross terms arising from the interactions between 1PN and quadrupole, and present estimates of higher-order cross terms. It is demonstrated that this method not only accurately predicts the long-term evolution of hierarchical systems but also captures fast oscillations observed in N-body simulations. We identify and validate resonances caused by quadrupole-squared effects, highlighting both consistencies and discrepancies when compared to N-body simulations. These discrepancies underscore the importance of mean-motion resonances, a factor overlooked in current secular perturbation frameworks. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of the subtleties and limitations inherent to secular perturbation theory, paving the way for future research and advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration and Nonthermal Emission at the Intrabinary Shock of Spider Pulsars. II: Fast-Cooling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider pulsars are binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass companion. Their X-ray emission, varying with orbital phase, originates from synchrotron radiation produced by high-energy electrons accelerated at the intrabinary shock. For fast-spinning pulsars in compact binary systems, the intrabinary shock emission occurs in the fast cooling regime. Using global two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the effect of synchrotron losses on the shock structure and the resulting emission, assuming that the pulsar wind is stronger than the companion wind (so, the shock wraps around the companion), as expected in black widows. We find that the shock opening angle gets narrower for greater losses; the lightcurve shows a more prominent double-peaked signature (with two peaks just before and after the pulsar eclipse) for stronger cooling; below the cooling frequency, the synchrotron spectrum displays a hard power-law range, consistent with X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>An Updated Detection Pipeline for Precursor Emission in Type II Supernova 2020tlf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new photometric pipeline for the detection of pre-supernova (pre-SN) emission in the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) sky survey. The method described is applied to SN 2020tlf, a type II SN (SN II) with precursor emission in the last ~100 days before first light. We re-analyze the YSE griz-band light curves of SN 2020tlf and provide revised pre-explosion photometry that includes a robust list of confident detection and limiting magnitudes. Compared to the results of Jacobson-Galan et al. 2022a, this new analysis yields fewer total r/i/z-band pre-SN detections at phases &gt; -100 days. Furthermore, we discourage the use of the blackbody modeling of the pre-explosion spectral energy distribution, the pre-SN bolometric light curve and the blackbody model parameters presented in Jacobson-Galan et al. 2022a. Nevertheless, binned photometry of SN 2020tlf confirms a consistent progenitor luminosity of ~10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before explosion.</description>

      <title>Photometric light curve studies: potential bias induced by exposure time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photometric observations, the flux averaged over the preset exposure time is usually used as the representation of an object's true flux at the middle of the exposure interval. For the study of transients and variables, it is also the default manner to build the light curves. In this work, we investigate the effect of this common practice on quantifying the photometric light curves. Our analysis shows that the flux averaged over the exposure time is not necessarily identical to the true flux so that potential bias may be introduced. The overall profile of the true light curve tends to be flattened by the exposure time. In addition, it is found that the peak position and photometric color can also be altered. We then discuss the impacts of the bias induced by exposure time on the light curves of stellar flares, periodic stars, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The bias can lead to an underestimate of the total fluxes of stellar flares which has been noticed in the observational data. For periodic stars that follow a sinusoidal light curve, the bias does not affect the period and peak position, but can result in the peak flux being underestimated. Meanwhile, the bias can result in steeper structure function at short timescales for AGN light curves. To obtain unbiased physical parameter estimates from the light curves, our analysis indicates that it is essential to account for this bias, particularly for transients and variables with very short timescales.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray flares from the jet of the blazar CTA 102 in 2016-2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CTA 102 is a $\gamma$-ray bright blazar that exhibited multiple flares in observations by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope during the period of 2016-2018. We present results from the analysis of multi-wavelength light curves aiming at revealing the nature of $\gamma$-ray flares from the relativistic jet in the blazar. We analyse radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray data obtained in a period from 2012 September 29 to 2018 October 8. We identify six flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve, showing a harder-when-brighter-trend in the $\gamma$-ray spectra. We perform a cross-correlation analysis of the multi-wavelength light curves. We find nearly zero time lags between the $\gamma$-ray and optical and X-ray light curves, implying a common spatial origin for the emission in these bands. We find significant correlations between the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves as well as negative/positive time lags with the $\gamma$-ray emission lagging/leading the radio during different flaring periods. The time lags between $\gamma$-ray and radio emission propose the presence of multiple $\gamma$-ray emission sites in the source. As seen in 43 GHz images from the Very Long Baseline Array, two moving disturbances (or shocks) were newly ejected from the radio core. The $\gamma$-ray flares from 2016 to 2017 are temporally coincident with the interaction between a traveling shock and a quasi-stationary one at $\sim$0.1 mas from the core. The other shock is found to emerge from the core nearly simultaneous with the $\gamma$-ray flare in 2018. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray flares originated from shock-shock interactions.</description>

      <title>The polarisation behaviour of OJ 287 viewed through radio, millimetre and optical observations between 2015 and 2017</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OJ 287 is a bright blazar with century-long observations, and one of the strongest candidates to host a supermassive black hole binary. Its polarisation behaviour between 2015 and 2017 (MJD 57300-58000) contains several interesting events that we re-contextualise in this study. We collected optical photometric and polarimetric data from several telescopes and obtained high-cadence light curves from this period. In the radio band, we collected mm-wavelength polarisation data from the AMAPOLA program. We combined these with existing multifrequency polarimetric radio results and the results of very-long-baseline-interferometry imaging with the Global mm-VLBI Array at 86 GHz. In December 2015, an optical flare was seen according to the general relativistic binary black hole model. We suggest that the overall activity near the accretion disk and the jet base during this time may be connected to the onset of a new moving component K seen in the jet in March 2017. With the additional optical data, we find a fast polarisation angle rotation of 210 degrees coinciding with the December 2015 flare, hinting at a possible link between these events. Based on the 86-GHz images, we calculated a new speed of 0.12 mas/yr for K, which places it inside the core at the time of the 2015 flare. This speed also supports the scenario where the passage of K through the quasi-stationary feature S1 could have been the trigger for the very-high-energy gamma-ray flare of OJ 287 seen in February 2017. With the mm-polarisation data, we established that these bands follow the cm-band data but show a difference during the time of K passing through S1. This indicates that the mm-bands trace the substructures of the jet still unresolved in the cm-bands.</description>

      <title>The putative center in NGC 1052</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many active galaxies harbor powerful relativistic jets, however, the detailed mechanisms of their formation and acceleration remain poorly understood. To investigate the area of jet acceleration and collimation with the highest available angular resolution, we study the innermost region of the bipolar jet in the nearby low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy NGC 1052. We combined observations of NGC 1052 taken with VLBA, GMVA, and EHT over one week in the spring of 2017. For the first time, NGC 1052 was detected with the EHT, providing a size of the central region in-between both jet bases of 250 RS (Schwarzschild radii) perpendicular to the jet axes. This size estimate supports previous studies of the jets expansion profile which suggest two breaks of the profile at around 300 RS and 10000 RS distances to the core. Furthermore, we estimated the magnetic field to be 1.25 Gauss at a distance of 22 {\mu}as from the central engine by fitting a synchrotron-self absorption spectrum to the innermost emission feature, which shows a spectral turn-over at about 130 GHz. Assuming a purely poloidal magnetic field, this implies an upper limit on the magnetic field strength at the event horizon of 26000 Gauss, which is consistent with previous measurements. The complex, low-brightness, double-sided jet structure in NGC 1052 makes it a challenge to detect the source at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. However, our first EHT observations have demonstrated that detection is possible up to at least 230 GHz. This study offers a glimpse through the dense surrounding torus and into the innermost central region, where the jets are formed. This has enabled us to finally resolve this region and provide improved constraints on its expansion and magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Cyclical accretion regime change in the slow X-ray pulsar 4U 0114+65 observed with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4U 0114+65 is a high-mass X-ray binary system formed by the luminous supergiant B1Ia, known as V{*} V662 Cas, and one of the slowest rotating neutron stars (NS) with a spin period of about 2.6 hours. This fact provides a rare opportunity to study interesting details of the accretion within each individual pulse of the compact object. In this paper, we analyze 200 ks of Chandra grating data, divided into 9 uninterrupted observations around the orbit. The changes in the circumstellar absorption column through the orbit suggest an orbital inclination of $\sim$ $40^{\circ}$ with respect to the observer and a companion mass-loss rate of $\sim$ 8.6 10$^{-7}$ solar masses yr$^{-1}$. The peaks of the NS pulse show a large pulse-to-pulse variability. Three of them show an evolution from a brighter regime to a weaker one. We propose that the efficiency of Compton cooling in this source fluctuates throughout an accumulation cycle. After significant depletion of matter within the magnetosphere, since the settling velocity is $\sim \times$ 2 times lower than the free-fall velocity, the source gradually accumulates matter until the density exceeds a critical threshold. This increase in density triggers a transition to a more efficient Compton cooling regime, leading to a higher mass accretion rate and consequently to an increased brightness.</description>

      <title>Black hole accretion and radiation variability in GRMHD simulations with Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revealed the horizon-scale radiation of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), our galaxy's central supermassive black hole, offering a new platform to test gravitational theories. The next step involves studying accretion flows and spacetime structures near black holes using EHT time variability data and GRMHD simulations. We study accretion dynamics in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes deviating from general relativity, using 2D GRMHD simulations with Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime. This study systematically investigates how light curve variability amplitudes from non-Kerr GRMHD simulations depend on Schwarzschild spacetime deviations, based on the constraints from weak gravitational fields and Sgr A*'s shadow size. We find that the dynamics of accretion flows systematically depend on the deviation. In spacetimes with a deeper gravitational potential, fluid and Alfv\'en velocities consistently decrease relative to the Schwarzschild metric, indicating weaker dynamical behavior. We also examine the influence of spacetime deviations on radiation properties by computing luminosity fluctuations at 230 GHz using general relativistic radiative transfer simulations, in line with EHT observations. The amplitude of these fluctuations exhibits a systematic dependence on the deviation parameters, decreasing for deeper gravitational potentials compared to the Schwarzschild metric. These features are validated using one of the theoretically predicted metrics, the Hayward metric, a model that describes nonsingular black holes. This characteristic is expected to have similar effects in future comprehensive simulations that include more realistic accretion disk models and electron cooling in the future, potentially aiding in distinguishing black hole solutions that explain the variability of Sgr A*.</description>

Abstract: SDSS J1115+0544 is a unique low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy with energetic ultraviolet (UV), optical and mid-infrared outbursts occurring in its nucleus. We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength photometric and radio follow-up observations covering a period of ~9 years since its discovery. We find that following a luminosity plateau of ~500 days, the UV/optical emission has decayed back to the pre-outburst level, suggesting that the nuclear outburst might be caused by a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). In this case, SDSS J1115+0544 could be an unusually slow-evolved optical TDE with longest rise and decline time-scales ever found. Three years later than the optical peak, a delayed radio brightening was found with a 5.5 GHz luminosity as high as ~1.9x10^39 erg/s. Using a standard equipartition analysis, we find the outflow powering the radio emission was launched at t~1260 days with a velocity of beta&lt;~0.1 and kinetic energy of E_K~&gt;10^50 erg. The delayed radio brightening coupled with the disappearing plateau in the UV/optical light curves is consistent with the scenario involving delayed ejection of an outflow from a state transition in the disk. SDSS J1115+0544 is the first TDE displaying both a short-lived UV/optical plateau emission and a late-time radio brightening. Future radio observations of these TDEs in the post-plateau decay phase will help to establish the connection between outflow launching and changes in accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Insights into Supermassive Black Hole Mergers from the Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, participants of the rapid response workshop on the gravitational wave background explored discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical models for a background originating from supermassive black hole binary mergers. Underestimated theoretical and/or experimental uncertainties are likely to be the explanation. Another key focus was the wide variety of search methods for supermassive black hole binaries, with the conclusion that the most compelling detections would involve systems exhibiting both electromagnetic and gravitational wave signatures</description>

      <title>Potential Contribution of Young Pulsar Wind Nebulae to Galactic High-Energy Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), especially the young ones, are among the most energetic astrophysical sources in the Galaxy. It is usually believed that the spin-down energy injected from the pulsars is converted into magnetic field and relativistic electrons, but the possible presence of proton acceleration inside PWNe cannot be ruled out. Previous works have estimated the neutrino emission from PWNe using various source catalogs measured in gamma-rays. However, such results rely on the sensitivity of TeV gamma-ray observations and may omit the contribution by unresolved sources. Here we estimate the potential neutrino emission from a synthetic population of PWNe in the Galaxy with a focus on the ones that are still in the free expansion phase. In the calculation, we model the temporal evolution of the free-expanding PWNe and consider the transport of protons inside the PWNe. The Crab nebula is treated as a standard template for young PWNe to evaluate some model parameters, such as the energy conversion fraction of relativistic protons and the target gas density for the hadronic process, which are relevant to neutrino production. In the optimistic case, the neutrino flux from the simulated young PWNe may constitute to 5% of the measured flux by IceCube around 100 TeV. At higher energy around 1 PeV, the neutrino emission from the population highly depends on the injection spectral shape, and also on the emission of the nearby prominent sources.</description>

      <title>Properties of high-redshift Type II supernovae discovered by the JADES transient survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &lt;= z &lt;= 3.61 discovered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. This high-redshift Type II SN sample allows us to compare low-redshift Type II SNe to their high-redshift counterparts. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>Heavy Axions Can Disrupt $\gamma$-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be produced in the hot dense plasma of fireballs that develop in the initial stage of $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) outflows. They can transport an enormous amount of energy away from the jet by propagating out of the fireball. The photons produced by the eventual decay of such ALPs do not reach a sufficient density to re-thermalize through pair production, preventing fireball re-emergence. Thus, the production of heavy ALPs disrupts the fireball and dims GRBs, allowing bright GRB observations to strongly constrain the existence of heavy ALPs. By adding ALP interactions to existing models of GRB fireballs, we set competitive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling down to $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \sim 4 \times 10^{-12}~{\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}}$ for ALPs in the mass range of 200 MeV - 5 GeV.</description>

      <title>Improvements to monoscopic analysis for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes: Application to H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) detect gamma rays by measuring the Cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles in the air shower when the gamma rays hit the atmosphere. At low energies, the limited amount of Cherenkov light produced typically implies that the event is registered by one IACT only. Such events are called monoscopic events, and their analysis is particularly difficult. Challenges include the reconstruction of the event's arrival direction, energy, and the rejection of background events. Here, we present a set of improvements, including a machine-learning algorithm to determine the correct orientation of the image, an intensity-dependent selection cut that ensures optimal performance, and a collection of new image parameters. To quantify these improvements, we use the central telescope of the H.E.S.S. IACT array. Knowing the correct image orientation, which corresponds to the arrival direction of the photon in the camera frame, is especially important for the angular reconstruction, which could be improved in resolution by 57% at 100 GeV. The event selection cut, which now depends on the total measured intensity of the events, leads to a reduction of the low-energy threshold for source analyses by ~50%. The new image parameters characterize the intensity and time distribution within the recorded images and complement the traditionally used Hillas parameters in the machine learning algorithms. We evaluate their importance to the algorithms in a systematic approach and carefully evaluate associated systematic uncertainties. We find that including subsets of the new variables in machine-learning algorithms improves the reconstruction and background rejection, resulting in a sensitivity improved by 41% at the low-energy threshold.</description>

      <title>Prompt gravitational-wave mergers aided by gas in Active Galactic Nuclei: The hydrodynamics of binary-single black hole scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole binary systems embedded in AGN discs have been proposed as a source of the observed gravitational waves (GWs) from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Studies have indicated binary-single encounters could be common place within this population, yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of how the ambient gas affects the dynamics of these three-body encounters. We present the first hydrodynamical simulations of black hole binary-single encounters in an AGN disc. We find gas is a non-negligible component of binary-single interactions, leading to unique dynamics, including the formation of quasi-stable hierarchical triples. The gas efficiently and reliably dissipates the energy of the three-body system, hardening the triple provided it remains bound after the initial encounter. The hardening timescale is shorter for higher ambient gas densities. Formed triple systems can be hardened reliably by $2-3$ orders of magnitude relative to the initial binary semi-major axis within less than a few AGN orbits, limited only by our resolution. We calculate that the gas hardening of the triple enhances the probability for a merger by a minimum factor of $3.5-8$ depending on our assumptions. In several cases, two of the black holes can execute periapses on the order of less than $10$ Schwarzschild radii, where the dynamics were fully resolved for previous close approaches. The likelihood of these prompt mergers increases when the gas density is larger. Our results suggest that current timescale estimates (without gas drag) for binary-single induced mergers are an upper bound. The shrinkage of the triple by gas has the prospect of increasing the chance for unique GW phenomena such as residual eccentricity, dephasing from a third object and double GW mergers.</description>

      <title>Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Astrophysical Neutrino Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, with TeV--PeV energies, offer unique insight into astrophysics and particle physics. Their incoming directions and flavor composition -- i.e., the proportion of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos in their flux -- are, individually, rewarding observables. Combined, they offer new opportunities, hitherto unexplored, that we expose for the first time. Anisotropy in the arrival directions of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos may reveal multiple populations of neutrino sources, differently distributed in the sky, and test whether neutrinos of different flavor propagate preferentially along certain directions, such as expected from breaking Lorentz invariance. Using 7.5 years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we make the first measurement of the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, constrain the presence of flavor dipoles and quadrupoles, and improve constraints on "compass asymmetries" introduced by Lorentz invariance violation. In the near future, upcoming neutrino telescopes will improve these measurements across the board.</description>

      <title>The origin of very-high-energy gamma-rays from GRB 221009A: implications for reverse shock proton synchrotron emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, GRB 221009A, known as the brightest of all time (BOAT), has been observed across an astounding range of $\sim 18$ orders of magnitude in energy, spanning from radio to VHE bands. Notably, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) recorded over $60000$ photons with energies exceeding $0.2\rm~TeV$, including the first-ever detection of photons above $10\rm~TeV$. However, explaining the observed energy flux evolution in the VHE band alongside late-time multi-wavelength data poses a significant challenge. Our approach involves a two-component structured jet model, consisting of a narrow core dominated by magnetic energy and a wide jet component dominated by matter. We show that the combination of the forward shock electron synchrotron self-Compton emission from both jets and reverse shock proton synchrotron emission from the wide jet could account for both the energy flux and spectral evolution in the VHE band, and the early TeV lightcurve may be influenced by prompt photons which could explain the initial steep rising phase. We noticed the arrival time of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO-KM2A coincident with the peak of the reverse shock proton synchrotron emission, especially a minor flare occurring about $\sim500-800$ seconds after the trigger, coinciding with the observed spectral hardening and arrival time of the $\sim 13\rm~TeV$ photons detected by LHAASO. These findings imply that the GRB reverse shock may serve as a potential accelerator of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, a hypothesis that could be tested through future multimessenger observations.</description>

Abstract: Supernova theory has struggled to explain the lightest known neutron star candidate with an accurate mass determination, the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ companion in the eccentric compact binary system J0453+1559. To improve the theoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova simulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core collapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a substantial kick of $\mathord{\sim} 100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Given residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ object remains plausible.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters on oscillation modes in hot Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that certain nuclear parameters are more dominant than others in governing global neutron star properties, such as its structure or oscillation mode characteristics. Although neutron stars can in general assumed to be cold, in astrophysical scenarios such as newly born neutron stars or remnants of binary neutron star mergers, finite temperature effects play a non-negligible role. In this work, we perform a consistent and systematic investigation of the role of nuclear parameters and thermal effects on neutron star properties and fluid oscillation modes within a full general relativistic scheme. We impose constraints on the parameter space of the relativistic mean field model using state-of-the-art information from terrestrial experiments and multi-messenger astrophysical data. We find effective nucleon mass to be the most important nuclear parameter controlling astrophysical observables of hot neutron stars, similar to the cold beta equilibrated matter. However, we conclude that the interplay among saturation properties and astrophysical observables depends not only on the thermal configurations considered but also on the constraints imposed. We also investigated the role of nuclear saturation parameters on some universal relations for hot NSs which are important in gravitational wave asteroseismology. Our investigation confirmed that these relations are mostly insensitive to nuclear saturation properties and mainly affected by variation of charge fraction in the star.</description>

      <title>A neural network emulator of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo selection function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization of search selection effects comprises a core element of gravitational-wave data analysis. Knowledge of selection effects is needed to predict observational prospects for future surveys and is essential in the statistical inference of astrophysical source populations from observed catalogs of compact binary mergers. Although gravitational-wave selection functions can be directly measured via injection campaigns -- the insertion and attempted recovery of simulated signals added to real instrumental data -- such efforts are computationally expensive. Moreover, the inability to interpolate between discrete injections limits the ability to which we can study narrow or discontinuous features in the compact binary population. For this reason, there is a growing need for alternative representations of gravitational-wave selection functions that are computationally cheap to evaluate and can be computed across a continuous range of compact binary parameters. In this paper, we describe one such representation. Using pipeline injections performed during Advanced LIGO &amp; Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3), we train a neural network emulator for $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$, the probability that given a compact binary with parameters is successfully detected, averaged over the course of O3. The emulator captures the dependence of $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$ on binary masses, spins, distance, sky position, and orbital orientation, and it is valid for compact binaries with components masses between $1$--$100\,M_\odot$. We test the emulator's ability to produce accurate distributions of detectable events, and demonstrate its use in hierarchical inference of the binary black hole population.</description>

      <title>Structure Functions of Rotation Measures Revealing the Origin of Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure function (SF) analysis is a powerful tool for studying plasma turbulence. Theoretically, the SF of Faraday rotation measure (RM) is expected to include a geometric component due to the relative orientation of sightlines through an ordered magnetic field. However, observational evidence for this component remains elusive. Here, we report that the SFs of the binary PSR B1744-24A and the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 20201124A exhibit both a periodic geometric component, caused by binary orbital motion, and a flat statistical component. The statistical component, induced by stochastic fluctuations in electron density and magnetic field, aligns with RM scatter derived from pulse depolarization. These findings indicate that FRB 20201124A has a binary origin and suggest that the periodic geometric component can serve as a diagnostic tool to identify binary companions.</description>

Abstract: Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches, as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Saddle-like GeV-TeV Spectrum of HESS J1809-193: $\gamma$-Rays Arising from Reverse-Shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) could be expected to leave imprints in $\gamma$-rays. We suggest that intriguing GeV-TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809$-$193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3$-$1925e is very likely to be the $\gamma$-ray signature of PWN J1809$-$193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during collision by the reverse shock, some very high-energy electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The very high-energy part of the remaining electrons were depleted by the strong magnetic field that was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The $\gamma$-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809$-$193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3$-$1925e. Thus, combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS J1809$-$193 and J1810.3$-$1925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint $\gamma$-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809$-$193.</description>

      <title>Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession of Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of resonant conversions mediated by non-vanishing magnetic moments between active neutrinos and a heavy sterile neutrino on the supernova neutrino flux. We present the level-crossing scheme for such a scenario and derive the neutrino fluxes after conversion, paying particular attention to the order in which the resonances occur. We then compute the expected event rates from the neutronization burst of a future supernova at DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande to derive new constraints on the neutrino magnetic moment. With this, we find a sensitivity down to a few $10^{-15} \mu_B$ for a sterile neutrino in the $O(\rm{eV})$ mass range.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>
