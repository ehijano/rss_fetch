      <title>ScAtt: an Attention based architecture to analyze Alzheimer's disease at cell type level from single-cell RNA-sequencing data</title>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory and behavior impairment severe enough to interfere with daily life activities. Understanding this disease pathogenesis can drive the development of new targets and strategies to prevent and treat AD. Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) have enabled the generation of massive amounts of transcriptomic data at the single-cell level provided remarkable insights into understanding the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we introduce ScAtt, an innovative Attention-based architecture, devised specifically for the concurrent identification of cell-type specific AD-related genes and their associated gene regulatory network. ScAtt incorporates a flexible model capable of capturing nonlinear effects, leading to the detection of AD-associated genes that might be overlooked by traditional differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses. Moreover, ScAtt effectively infers a gene regulatory network depicting the combined influences of genes on the targeted disease, as opposed to examining correlations among genes in conventional gene co-expression networks. In an application to 95,186 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 17 hippocampus samples, ScAtt shows substantially better performance in modeling quantitative changes in expression levels between AD and healthy controls. Consequently, ScAtt performs better than existing methods in the identification of AD-related genes, with more unique discoveries and less overlap between cell types. Functional enrichments of the corresponding gene modules detected from gene regulatory network show significant enrichment of biologically meaningful AD-related pathways across different cell types.</description>

      <title>Whole Genome Transformer for Gene Interaction Effects in Microbiome Habitat Specificity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the vast genetic diversity within microbiomes offers unparalleled insights into complex phenotypes, yet the task of accurately predicting and understanding such traits from genomic data remains challenging. We propose a framework taking advantage of existing large models for gene vectorization to predict habitat specificity from entire microbial genome sequences. Based on our model, we develop attribution techniques to elucidate gene interaction effects that drive microbial adaptation to diverse environments. We train and validate our approach on a large dataset of high quality microbiome genomes from different habitats. We not only demonstrate solid predictive performance, but also how sequence-level information of entire genomes allows us to identify gene associations underlying complex phenotypes. Our attribution recovers known important interaction networks and proposes new candidates for experimental follow up.</description>
