      <title>Integrated analysis of informality, minimum wage, and monopsony power: A synthesis of meta-analyses with unified theoretical underpinnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document offers a synthesis of recent economic literature on three interconnected areas of labor markets: informality, the effects of the minimum wage, and monopsony power. Through the consolidation and meta-analysis of findings from multiple existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, their causes, consequences, and associated public policies are examined. It is concluded that conventional views on these topics often overestimate the magnitude of effects. Policies to reduce informality based solely on lowering formalization costs are largely ineffective, while increased enforcement at the extensive margin shows more promising results. The effects of the minimum wage on employment, measured through the own-wage elasticity (OWE), are consistently modest, suggesting that job losses are limited compared to wage gains. To reconcile and microfound these findings, an integrated theoretical model of firm optimization is introduced, simultaneously incorporating firm heterogeneity, monopsony power, and endogenous formality decisions, rigorously demonstrating how the interaction of these forces can explain the observed empirical regularities. A cross-cutting and significant finding is the omnipresence of publication bias across all these study areas, which tends to inflate the magnitude of the effects reported in the published literature. Corrected estimates of the effects generally approach zero. Meta-regression is established as an indispensable tool for identifying heterogeneity and the true underlying effects in the empirical evidence, compelling a recalibration of both theory and economic policy recommendations towards a more nuanced and integrated approach.</description>

      <title>B\"orgers's Open Question Resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on stochastic finite-action mechanisms, we study implementation in undominated strategies and iteratively undominated strategies. We establish both possibility and impossibility results that resolve the open question in B\"orgers (1995). Contrary to the conventional understanding that positive results on Nash implementation need separability, quasilinearity, or infinite action sets, we provide -- to our knowledge -- the first positive result beyond those demanding assumptions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in dynamic networks with time-varying inputs to allocate responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Responsibility in complex networks extends beyond direct actions: players should also bear responsibility for the indirect effects within their supply chains or network. We introduce a novel framework to allocate responsibility for indirect environmental, social, and economic impacts across a dynamic network. Unlike static approaches, our framework accounts for the evolving structure of supply chains, financial systems, and other interconnected systems, where relationships change over time. We use the time-dependent Laplacian matrix to capture how responsibility propagates through the network, revealing a diffusion process that aligns with key axioms of fairness: linearity, efficiency, symmetry, and the independent player property. We show that approximating the responsibility measure preserves these properties, supporting the use of our framework as a rigorous method to allocate responsibility in real-world networks.</description>
