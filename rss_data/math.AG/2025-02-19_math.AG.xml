      <title>Euler characteristics of higher rank double ramification loci in genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double ramification loci parametrise marked curves where a weighted sum of the markings is linearly trivial; higher rank loci are obtained by imposing several such conditions simultaneously. We obtain closed formulae for the orbifold Euler characteristics of double ramification loci, and their higher rank generalisations, in genus one. The rank one formula is a polynomial, while the higher rank formula involves greatest common divisors of matrix minors. The proof is based on a recurrence relation in the Grothendieck ring, which allows for induction on the rank and number of markings.</description>

      <title>K3 surfaces of any Artin-Mazur height over $\mathbb{F}_5$ and $\mathbb{F}_7$ via Quasi-F-split singularities and GPU acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12428v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fast algorithm to calculate the Artin-Mazur height (equivalently, the quasi-$F$-split height) of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, building on the work in arXiv:2204.10076. We provide a implementation of our approach, and use it to show that there are quartic K3 surfaces of any Artin-Mazur height over $\mathbb{F}_{5}$ and $\mathbb{F}_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article serves as an introduction to the special volume on Positive Geometry in the journal Le Matematiche. We attempt to answer the question in the title by describing the origins and objects of positive geometry at this early stage of its development. We discuss the problems addressed in the volume and report on the progress. We also list some open challenges.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of general type surfaces with $q=4$, $p_g=6$ and $K^2=24$. These surfaces enjoy some interesting properties: they are Lagrangian in their Albanese variety and their canonical map is $2:1$ onto a degree $12$ surface in $\mathbb P^5$ with $44$ even nodes.</description>

      <title>Semigroups, Cartier divisors and convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Newton--Okounkov bodies provides direct relations and points out analogies between the theory of mixed volumes of convex bodies, on the one hand, and the intersection theories of Cartier divisors and of Shokurov $b$-divisors, on the other hand. The classical inequalities between mixed volumes of convex bodies correspond to inequalities between intersection indices of nef Cartier divisors on an irreducible projective variety and between the birationally invariant intersection indices of nef type Shokurov $b$-divisors on an irreducible algebraic variety. Such algebraic inequalities are known as Khovanskii--Teissier inequalities. Our proof of these inequalities is based on simple geometric inequalities on two dimensional convex bodies and on pure algebraic arguments. The classical geometric inequalities follow from the algebraic inequalities. We collected results from a few papers which were published during the last forty five years. Some theorems of the present paper were never stated, but all ideas needed for their proofs are contained in the published papers. So we avoid all heavy proofs. Our goal is to present an overview of the area. Notions of homogeneous polynomials on commutative semigroups and of their polarizations provide an adequate language for discussing the subject. We use this language through the paper.</description>

      <title>The equivariant degree and an enriched count of rational cubics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the equivariant degree and local degree of a proper $G$-equivariant map between smooth $G$-manifolds when $G$ is a compact Lie group and prove a local to global result. We show the local degree can be used to compute the equivariant Euler characteristic of a smooth, compact $G$-manifold and the Euler number of a relatively oriented $G$-equivariant vector bundle when $G$ is finite. As an application, we give an equivariantly enriched count of rational plane cubics through a $G$-invariant set of 8 general points in $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$, valued in the representation ring and Burnside ring of a finite group. When $\mathbb{Z}/2$ acts by pointwise complex conjugation this recovers a signed count of real rational cubics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that generalised Calabi-Yau dg (co)algebras are Koszul dual to generalised symmetric dg (co)algebras, without needing to assume any smoothness or properness hypotheses. Similarly, we show that Gorenstein and Frobenius are Koszul dual properties. As an application, we give a new characterisation of Poincar\'e duality spaces, which extends a theorem of F\'elix- Halperin-Thomas to the non-simply connected setting.</description>

      <title>Volumes of odd strata of quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We express the Masur--Veech volumes of "completed" strata of quadratic differentials with only odd singularities as a sum over stable graphs. This formula generalizes the formula of Delecroix-Goujard-Zograf-Zorich for principal strata. The coefficients of the formula are in our case intersection numbers of psi classes with the Witten-Kontsevich combinatorial classes; they naturally appear in the count of metric ribbon graphs with prescribed odd valencies. The "completed" strata that we consider are unions of odd strata and some adjacent strata, that contribute to the Masur--Veech volume with explicit weights. We present several conjectures on the large genus asymptotics of these Masur--Veech volumes that could be tackled with this formula.</description>

      <title>Torsion points and concurrent exceptional curves on del Pezzo surfaces of degree one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blow-up of the anticanonical base point on a del Pezzo surface $S$ of degree 1 gives rise to a rational elliptic surface $\mathscr{E}$ with only irreducible fibers. The sections of minimal height of $\mathscr{E}$ are in correspondence with the $240$ exceptional curves on $S$. A natural question arises when studying the configuration of these curves: if a point on $S$ is contained in 'many' exceptional curves, it is torsion on its fiber on $\mathscr{E}$? In 2005, Kuwata proved for the analogous question on del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$, where there are 56 exceptional curves, that if 'many' equals $4$ or more, the answer is yes. In this paper, we prove that for del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1, the answer is yes if 'many' equals $9$ or more. Moreover, we give counterexamples where a \textsl{non}-torsion point lies in the intersection of $7$ exceptional curves. We give partial results for the still open case of 8 intersecting exceptional curves.</description>

      <title>A construction of the polylogarithm motive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical polylogarithms give rise to a variation of mixed Hodge-Tate structures on the punctured projective line $S=\mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}$, which is an extension of the symmetric power of the Kummer variation by a trivial variation. By results of Beilinson-Deligne, Huber-Wildeshaus, and Ayoub, this polylogarithm variation has a lift to the category of mixed Tate motives over $S$, whose existence is proved by computing the corresponding space of extensions in both the motivic and the Hodge settings. In this paper, we construct the polylogarithm motive as an explicit relative cohomology motive, namely that of the complement of the hypersurface $\{1-zt_1\cdots t_n=0\}$ in affine space $\mathbb{A}^n_S$ relative to the union of the hyperplanes $\{t_i=0\}$ and $\{t_i=1\}$.</description>

      <title>Syzygies of canonical ribbons on higher genus curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the syzygies of the canonical embedding of a ribbon $\widetilde{C}$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g \geq 1$. We show that the linear series Clifford index and the resolution Clifford index are equal for a general ribbon of arithmetic genus $p_a$ on a general curve of genus $g$ with $p_{a} \geq \operatorname{max}\{3g+7, 6g-4\}$. Among non-general ribbons, the case of split ribbons is particularly interesting. Equality of the two Clifford indices for a split ribbon is related to the gonality conjecture for $C$ and it implies Green's conjecture for all double covers $C'$ of $C$ with $g(C') \geq \textrm{max}\{3g+2, 6g-4\}$. We reduce it to the vanishing of certain Koszul cohomology groups of an auxiliary module of syzygies associated to $C$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We show that a compact K\"ahler manifold $M$ containing a smooth connected divisor $D$ such that $M \setminus D$ is a homology cell, e.g., contractible, must be projective space with $D$ a hyperplane, provided $\dim M \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. This answers conjectures of Fujita in these dimensions.</description>

      <title>Relative quantum cohomology of the Chiang Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the open Gromov-Witten disk invariants and the relative quantum cohomology of the Chiang Lagrangian $L_\triangle \subset \mathbb{C}P^3$. Since $L_\triangle$ is not fixed by any anti-symplectic involution, the invariants may augment straightforward $J$-holomorphic disk counts with correction terms arising from the formalism of Fukaya $A_\infty$-algebras and bounding cochains. These correction terms are shown in fact to be non-trivial for many invariants. Moreover, examples of non-vanishing mixed disk and sphere invariants are obtained.
  We characterize a class of open Gromov-Witten invariants, called basic, which coincide with straightforward counts of $J$-holomorphic disks. Basic invariants for the Chiang Lagrangian are computed using the theory of axial disks developed by Evans-Lekili and Smith in the context of Floer cohomology. The open WDVV equations give recursive relations which determine all invariants from the basic ones. The denominators of all invariants are observed to be powers of $2$ indicating a non-trivial arithmetic structure of the open WDVV equations. The magnitude of invariants is not monotonically increasing with degree. Periodic behavior is observed with periods $8$ and $16.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lurie and Gepner--Meier each define equivariant cohomology theories, namely \emph{tempered cohomology} and \emph{equivariant elliptic cohomology}, respectively, using derived algebraic geometry. We construct a natural equivalence between these theories where they overlap. Moreover, we emphasise the naturality and coherence of both these equivariant theories as well as our comparison. To demonstrate the use of this comparison, we show that the $G$-fixed points of equivariant topological modular forms is dualisable as a $\mathrm{TMF}$-module for all compact Lie groups $G$ that decompose as a product of a torus and a finite group by formally reducing to an argument of Gepner--Meier.</description>

      <title>The Conjecture of Dixmier for the first Weyl algebra is true</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $A_1=K[x][\partial ]$ be the first Weyl algebra. In this paper we prove that the Dixmier conjecture for the first Weyl algebra is true, i.e. each algebra endomorphism of the algebra $A_1$ is an automorphism.</description>

      <title>Tropical combinatorics of max-linear Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <title>On the Rich Landscape of Complete Intersection Monomial Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to explore complete intersection monomial curves from a contemporary perspective. The main goal is to help readers understand the intricate connections within the field and its potential applications. The properties of any monomial curve singularity will be first reviewed, highlighting the interaction between combinatorial and algebraic properties. Next, we will revisit the two main characterizations of complete intersection monomial curves. One is based on deep algebraic properties given by Herzog and Kunz in 1971, while the other is based on a combinatorial approach given by Delorme in 1976. Our aim is to bridge the gap between these perspectives present in the current literature. Then, we will focus on recent advances that show an intriguing connection between numerical semigroups and Alexander polynomials of knots. Finally, we will revisit the deformation theory of these curves and provide an answer to a question posed by Buchweitz and Greuel regarding curve deformations.</description>

      <title>Classification of torsion of elliptic curves over quartic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a quartic field $K$. By the Mordell-Weil theorem, $E(K)$ is a finitely generated group. We determine all the possibilities for the torsion group $E(K)_{tor}$ where $K$ ranges over all quartic fields $K$ and $E$ ranges over all elliptic curves over $K$. We show that there are no sporadic torsion groups, or in other words, that all torsion groups either do not appear or they appear for infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves $E$.
  Proving this requires showing that numerous modular curves $X_1(m,n)$ have no non-cuspidal degree $4$ points. We deal with almost all the curves using one of 3 methods: a method for the rank 0 cases requiring no computation; the Hecke sieve, a local method requiring computer-assisted computations; and the global method, an argument for the positive rank cases also requiring no computation. We deal with the handful of remaining cases using ad hoc methods.</description>
