      <title>Equidistribution of expanding translates of smooth curves in homogeneous spaces under the action of a product of SO(n,1)'s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting distributions of expanding translates of a compact segment of a smooth curve under a diagonal subgroup of $G=\mathrm{SO}(n_1,1)\times\cdots\times\mathrm{SO}(n_k,1)$, where $G$ acts on a finite volume homogeneous space $L/\Gamma$ as a subgroup. We show that the expanding translates of the curve become equidistributed in the orbit closure of $G$, provided that Lebesgue almost every point on the curve avoids a certain countable collection of algebraic obstructions. The proof involves Ratner's measure classification theorem, Kempf's geometric invariant theory, and the linearization technique.</description>

      <title>On measures and semiconjugacies for affine interval exchange transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study affine interval exchange transformations (AIETs) which are semi-conjugated to interval exchange transformations (IETs) of hyperbolic periodic type. More precisely, we study the Hausdorff dimension of their invariant measures, as well as the Hausdorff dimension of conformal measures of self-similar interval exchange transformations, and implicit relations between them. Among the highlights of this paper, we provide a precise formula for the Hausdorff dimension when the vector of the logarithm of slopes is of central-stable type with respect to the renormalization matrix. This dimension turns out to be strictly between $0$ and $1$. Moreover, we study the regularity of the semi-conjugacy between an AIET and an IET in the periodic case, deriving explicit formulas for their supremal H\"older exponents.</description>

      <title>Chaotic phenomena in generic unfoldings of the Hamilton Hopf bifurcation with emphasis on the restricted planar circular 3-body problem beyond the Gascheau-Routh mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that a generic unfolding of an analytic Hamiltonian Hopf singularity (in an open set with codimension 1 boundary) possesses transverse homoclinic orbits for subcritical values of the parameter close to the bifurcation parameter. As a consequence, these systems display chaotic dynamics with arbitrarily large topological entropy. We verify that the Hamiltonian of the restricted planar circular three-body problem (RPC3BP) close to the Lagrangian point $L_4$ falls within this open set. The generic condition ensuring the presence of transversal homoclinic intersections is subtle and involves the so-called Stokes constant. Thus, in the case of the RPC3BP close to $L_4$, our result holds conditionally on the value of this constant.</description>

      <title>Autoencoding Dynamics: Topological Limitations and Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space" $\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an "encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon \mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems having $M$ as an invariant manifold.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining nonequilibrium diffusions with Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and empirical trajectories from schooling fish.</description>

      <title>Force recurrence near zero</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering any dense subsemigroup of the additive semigroup of positive real numbers and a filter associated with it as the domain of thought, various concepts of sets like sets that forces recurrence near zero, sets that contains broken IP-set near near zero, sets that forces uniform recurrence near zero and sets that contains broken syndetic set near zero have been introduced and some relation among them are established by assuming countability of the said dense subsemigroup. The article begin with a characterization of recurrent point near zero.</description>

      <title>A unifying theory for metrical results on regular continued fraction convergents and mediants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Ito's (\cite{I1989}) natural extension of the Farey tent map, which generates all regular continued fraction convergents and mediants of a given irrational. With a slight shift in perspective on the order in which these convergents and mediants arise, this natural extension is shown to provide an elegant and powerful tool in the metric theory of continued fractions. A wealth of old and new results -- including limiting distributions of approximation coefficients, analogues of a theorem of Legendre and their refinements, and a generalisation of L\'evy's Theorem to subsequences of convergents and mediants -- are presented as corollaries within this unifying theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems Models for Market Evolution: A Mechanistic Alternative to Autoregressive Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to modeling market dynamics using ordinary differential equations that explicitly incorporates product competitiveness and consumer behavior. Our framework treats market segments as interacting populations in a dynamical system analogous to predator-prey models, where competitive advantages drive market share transitions through mechanistic modeling of market flows including new product adoption, refresh cycles, and obsolescence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sets with arbitrary Hausdorff and packing scales in infinite dimensional Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every couple of Hausdorff functions $ \psi$ and $\varphi $ verifying some mild assumptions, there exists a compact subset $ K $ of the Baire space such that the $ \varphi$-Hausdorff measure and the $ \psi$-packing measure on $ K$ are both finite and positive. Such examples are then embedded in any infinite dimensional Banach space to answer positively a question of Fan on the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.</description>
