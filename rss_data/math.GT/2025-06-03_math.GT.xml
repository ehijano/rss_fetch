      <title>The flip map and involutions on Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flip symmetry on knot diagrams induces an involution on Khovanov homology. We prove that this involution is determined by its behavior on unlinks; in particular, it is the identity map when working over $\mathbb{F}_2$. This confirms a folklore conjecture on the triviality of the Viro flip map. As a corollary, we prove that the symmetries on the transvergent and intravergent diagrams of a strongly invertible knot induce the same involution on Khovanov homology. We also apply similar techniques to study the half sweep-around map.</description>

      <title>Regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$, $4$-torus, and small covers over $\Delta^2 \times \Delta^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crystallization of a PL manifold is an edge-colored graph encoding a contracted triangulation of the manifold. The concept of regular genus generalizes the notions of surface genus and Heegaard genus for 3-manifolds to higher-dimensional closed PL manifolds. The regular genus of a PL manifold is a PL invariant. Determining the regular genus of a closed PL $n$-manifold remains a fundamental challenge in combinatorial topology. In this article, we first resolve a conjecture by proving that the regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ is 6. Additionally, we determine that the regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ is 16. We also present some observations related to the regular genus of the $n$-dimensional torus and conjecture that the regular genus of $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{S}^1$ ($n$ times) is $1+\frac{(n+1)! \ (n-3)}{8}$, for $n\ge 5$. Then, we investigate the regular genus of small covers. Small covers are closed $n$-manifolds admitting a locally standard $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-action with orbit space homeomorphic to a simple convex polytope $P^n$. For the polytope $P = \Delta^2 \times \Delta^2$, we classify all the small covers up to Davis-Januszkiewicz (D-J) equivalence and show that there are exactly seven such covers. Among these, one is $\mathbb{RP}^2 \times \mathbb{RP}^2$, while the others are $\mathbb{RP}^2$-bundles over $\mathbb{RP}^2$. Remarkably, each of these seven small covers has the regular genus 8. Results in this article provide explicit regular genus values for several important 4-manifolds, offering new insights and tools for future work in combinatorial topology.</description>

      <title>Menelaus' and Ceva's theorems for translation triangles in Thurston geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After having investigated and defined the ``surface of a translation-like triangle" in each non-constant curvature Thurston geometry \cite{Cs-Sz25}, we generalize the famous Menelaus' and Ceva's theorems for translation triangles in the mentioned spaces.
  The described method makes it possible to transfer further classical Euclidean theorems and notions to Thurston geometries with non-constant curvature. In our work we will use the projective models of Thurston geometries described by E. Moln\'ar in \cite{M97}.</description>

      <title>Ping-pong dynamics of hyperbolic-like actions with non-simple points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hyperbolic-like group is a subgroup of $\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ such that every non-trivial element has exactly two fixed points, one attracting and one repelling. We investigate the ping-pong dynamics of hyperbolic-like groups, inspired by a conjecture of Bonatti. We show the existence of a proper ping-pong partition for any pair of non-cyclic point stabilizers. More precisely, our results explicitly provide such a ping-pong partition.</description>

      <title>Transverse tori in Engel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that tori in Engel 4-manifolds behave analogously to knots in contact 3-manifolds: Every torus with trivial normal bundle is isotopic to infinitely many distinct transverse tori, distinguished locally (and globally in the nullhomologous case) by their formal invariants. (Few examples of transverse tori were previously known.) We classify the formal invariants, which are richer than for transverse knots. We show that in an overtwisted Engel structure, up to homotopy through such structures, these invariants are a complete set of uniqueness obstructions, and every torus with trivial normal bundle can be made transverse realizing any combination of these invariants. Fixing Engel structures not known to be overtwisted, we explore the range of the primary invariants of given tori. A sample application is that many Engel manifolds admit infinitely many transverse homotopy classes of unknotted transverse tori such that each class contains infinitely many transverse isotopy classes.</description>

      <title>Residual finiteness of some automorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a smooth, closed 2-connected manifold $M$ of dimension $d \geq 6$, the topological mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is residually finite, in contrast to the situation for the smooth mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Diff}(M)$. Combined with a result of Sullivan, this implies that $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is an arithmetic group. The proof uses embedding calculus, and is of independent interest: we show that the $T_k$-mapping class group, $\pi_0 T_k \mathrm{Diff}(M)$, is residually finite, for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The statement on the topological mapping class group is then deduced from the Weiss fibre sequence, convergence of the embedding calculus tower and smoothing theory.</description>

      <title>Free ribbon lemma for surface-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free surface-link is a surface-link whose fundamental group is a free group not necessarily meridian-based. Free ribbon lemma says that every free sphere-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon sphere-link. Four different proofs of Free ribbon lemma are explained. The first proof is done in an earlier paper. The second proof is done by showing that there is an O2-handle basis of a ribbon surface-link. The third proof is done by removing the commuter relations from a Wirtinger presentation of a free group, which a paper on another proof of Free ribbon lemma complements. The fourth proof is given by the special case of the proof of the result that every free surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is a stabilization of a free ribbon sphere-link. As a consequence, it is shown that a surface-link is a sublink of a free surface-link if and only if it is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an alternative way of computing Alexander polynomials of knots/links, based on the Artin representation of the corresponding braids by automorphisms of a free group. Then we apply the same method to other representations of braid groups discovered by Wada and compare the corresponding isotopic invariants to Alexander polynomials.</description>

      <title>On winding numbers of $K_5$ minus an edge in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be the graph on vertices $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, and having all edges except $(4, 5)$. A continuous map $f:K\to \R^2$ is called an \emph{almost embedding} if $f$-images of non-adjacent edges are disjoint. Take the winding numbers of the $f$-image of the oriented cycle $(1, 2, 3)$ around $f(4)$ and around $f(5)$. We prove that the difference of these numbers equals $\pm 1$. This is surprising, because in other similar situations analogous statement is wrong.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct decompositions of:
  (1) the cohomology of smooth stacks,
  (2) the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, and
  (3) the vanishing cycle cohomology of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks,
  assuming a good moduli space exists and the tangent space has a pointwise orthogonal structure. These conditions are satisfied by many stacks of interest, including moduli stacks of semistable $G$-bundles and (twisted) $G$-Higgs bundles on curves, $G$-character stacks of oriented closed 2-manifolds and various 3-manifolds, and moduli stacks of semistable coherent sheaves on Calabi--Yau threefolds and K3 surfaces with generic polarization. As a special case, we prove a PBW-type theorem for cohomological Hall algebras of $3$-Calabi--Yau categories with commutative orientation data, a strong form of the cohomological integrality conjecture for such categories. We define the BPS cohomology as the primary summand of the decomposition. When the stack is smooth, the BPS cohomology coincides with the intersection cohomology of the good moduli space, generalizing a theorem of Meinhardt--Reineke. Using the BPS cohomology for singular spaces, we propose a formulation of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for the stack of $G$-Higgs bundles generalizing the work of Hausel and Thaddeus for type A groups, and a version of Langlands duality for character stacks of compact oriented 3-manifolds, following Ben-Zvi--Gunningham--Jordan--Safronov.</description>
