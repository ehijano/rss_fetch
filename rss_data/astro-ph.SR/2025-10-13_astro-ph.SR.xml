      <title>The optical photometric variability of Herbig Ae/Be stars from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a photometric time domain study of 188 intermediate-mass young stars observed in Full Frame Image mode with the TESS satellite over the first 3.3 years of its mission. The majority of these targets are classified as Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes). All were monitored at optical wavelengths for at least one 27-day TESS sector, with many having multiple sectors of data. From a custom aperture photometry pipeline, we produced light curves and analyzed the variability therein, as a function of stellar and circumstellar properties. Based on visual and statistical analysis, we find that ~95% of HAeBes are variable on timescales of 10 minutes to 1 month, with the most common light curve morphology being stochastic. Approximately 15% of the set display quasi-periodic variability. In comparison to sets of low-mass T Tauri stars monitored with optical space telescopes, the Herbig Ae/Be stars display a much lower incidence of ``dipper" behaviors (quasi-periodic or aperiodic fading events), as well as periodic modulations. As posited by previous work, we conclude that magnetic starspots are rare on HAeBes, and that the inner circumstellar dust rims of these objects lie at substantially larger radii than for low-mass young stars. Beyond these differences, the accretion dynamics of young stars less than ~7$M_\odot$ appear to be largely consistent based on their time domain properties from data streams of up to three months' duration. We do, however, find tentative evidence for a change in variability amplitude above this mass boundary, particularly for quasi-periodic behavior.</description>

      <title>How precisely can we measure the ages of subgiant and giant stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise stellar ages are fundamental to Galactic archaeology. However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang &amp; Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages and red giant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-5. These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise isochrone ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Tracing Planetary Accretion in a 3 Gyr-old Hydrogen-Rich White Dwarf: The Extremely Polluted Atmosphere of LSPM J0207+3331</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of 13 heavy elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sr) in the photosphere of LSPM J0207+3331, a ~3 Gyr old hydrogen-rich white dwarf with an effective temperature comparable to that of the Sun. Upper limits on carbon, obtained through the absence of molecular CH, suggest accretion from a carbon-volatile-depleted source. The accreted parent body exhibits slight deficits of Mg and Si relative to Fe but otherwise bulk Earth-like abundance patterns; a reasonable interpretation is that LSPM J0207+3331 is accreting a massive differentiated rocky body that had a core mass fraction higher than the Earth's. The high level of pollution indicates that substantial accretion events can still occur even after 3 Gyr of cooling. We also detect weak Ca II H &amp; K line-core emission, making this only the second known isolated polluted white dwarf to exhibit this phenomenon and suggesting the presence of additional physical processes in or above the upper atmosphere. Our analysis also highlights the critical importance of including heavy elements in the model atmosphere structure calculations for highly polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs. Neglecting their contribution significantly impacts the inferred thermodynamic structure, leading to inaccuracies in derived stellar parameters. Finally, we show that the observed 11.3 microns infrared excess can be explained by a single silicate dust disk rather than a two-ring disk model.</description>

      <title>The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models VI. Red Diamondback: Extending Diamondback with SPHINX for Brown Dwarf Early Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Sonora Diamondback brown dwarf evolution models to higher effective temperatures to treat the evolution of younger, higher mass objects. Due to an upper temperature limit of $T_\mathrm{eff}=$2400 K in the original Sonora Diamondback model grid, high mass objects ($M\geq$ 0.05 $M_\mathrm{\odot}=$ 52.4 $M_\mathrm{J}$) were limited to ages of $\gtrsim$ 100 Myr. To include the early evolution of brown dwarfs at $T_\mathrm{eff}&gt;$ 2400 K, we use existing and new SPHINX cloud-free model atmosphere calculations of temperature structures of M-type atmospheres. These atmospheres range from $T_\mathrm{eff}$ 2000--4000 K, log($g$) 3.0--5.5, and metallicity [M/H] $-$0.5 to $+$0.5. This combination of Diamondback and SPHINX atmospheres, with a transition across $T_\mathrm{eff}$ 2000--2400 K, allows us to calculate evolution tracks, and infrared photometry and colors, for ages $&gt;$ 1 Myr and masses from above the hydrogen burning minimum mass down to planetary masses. The Hayashi phase of massive brown dwarf evolution (ages $&lt;$ 10--100 Myr) at low surface gravity leads to nearly constant $T_\mathrm{eff}$ values, at effective temperatures much lower than would be obtained from simply extrapolating backwards from evolution tracks at older ages.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of omega Centauri: II. Evidence for a split white dwarf cooling sequence in the near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the white dwarf cooling sequence (WD CS) in omega Centauri based on combined Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST observations. Our analysis confirms the previously reported split - based on HST observations in ultraviolet filters - in the upper part of the WD CS, consistent with the presence of two distinct WD populations, and extends it to a significantly fainter and cooler limit (down to ~8000 K), corresponding to cooling ages of about 1 Gyr. We used artificial star (AS) tests and cooling models to confirm that the split is evidence of two WD populations with different masses and progenitors: one sequence of canonical WDs produced by the He-normal progenitors, and one sequence of low-mass WDs originated from the cluster He-rich component. We show that the fraction of WDs from the He-rich component in the outer regions is smaller than that found in the innermost regions. We also studied the kinematics of WDs and showed that in the outer regions, the velocity distribution of WDs from He-rich progenitors is slightly radially anisotropic, while that of canonical WDs is slightly tangentially anisotropic. Both the radial variation of the fraction of WDs from the He-rich population and the difference between their velocity distribution and that of canonical WDs are consistent with spatial and kinematic differences previously found for He-rich and He-normal main-sequence (MS) stars and in general agreement with models predicting that He-rich stars form more centrally concentrated than He-normal stars.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebula Evolution for Single Stellar Models. The Formation of Neutral Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are presented from the formation up to the late evolution of planetary nebula, for 6 different stellar models from 1 to 5 Mo. The hydrodynamical models use stellar evolution calculations as inner boundary conditions and updated values for the number of ionizing photons. Special emphasis is placed on the formation of neutral spikes, as recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. The results indicate that neutral spikes can be detected either at the formation of planetary nebulae or in their decline. In the first case, the temporal window decreases with the mass of the model, ranging from 3,000 years in the 1 Mo case to 0 for 5 Mo. In the second case, only the 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 Mo cases allow us to detect the neutral spikes for most of the remaining time.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Magnetic Complexity of Active Regions on Solar Wind Properties During Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linking solar wind properties to the activities and characteristics of its source regions can enhance our understanding of its origin and generation mechanisms. Using the Mount Wilson magnetic classification (MWMC), we categorize all active regions (ARs) between 1999 and 2020 into three groups: alpha, beta, and complex ARs. Subsequently, we classify the near-Earth AR solar wind into the corresponding three types based on the magnetic type of ARs. Our results show that alpha, beta, and complex ARs account for 19.99%, 66.67%, and 13.34% of all ARs, respectively, while their corresponding AR solar wind proportions are 16.96%, 45.18%, and 37.86%. The properties of solar wind from different types of ARs vary significantly. As the magnetic complexity of ARs increases, the corresponding AR solar wind exhibits higher magnetic field strength, charge states, helium abundance (A_He), and first ionization potential (FIP) bias. Our results demonstrate that complex ARs are more effective at generating solar wind. Additionally, the strong magnetic fields and frequent magnetic activities in complex ARs can heat the plasma to higher temperatures and effectively transport helium-rich materials from the lower atmosphere to the upper corona.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic shallow water equations with the alpha effect: Rossby-dynamo waves in solar--stellar tachoclines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The activity of Sun-like stars is governed by the magnetic field, which is believed to be generated in a thin layer between convective and radiative envelopes. The dynamo layer, also called the tachocline, permits the existence of Rossby waves (r-modes) described by magnetohydrodynamic shallow water models, which may lead to short-term cycles in stellar activity. Convective cells penetrate into the layer creating an overshoot upper part, where they transport an additional energy for vigorous activity. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of overshooting convection on the dynamics of Rossby waves in the tachoclines of Sun-like stars. Here we write the magnetohydrodynamic shallow water equations with the effect of the penetrative convection and study the dynamics of wave modes in the layer. The formalism leads to the excitation of new oscillation modes connected with the dynamo coefficient, alpha, causing periodic modulations of all parameters in the tachocline. The modes are coupled with the Rossby waves resulting mutual exchange of convective and rotation energies. The timescales of Rossby-dynamo waves, for certain parameters, correspond to Schwabe (11 years) and Rieger (150-170 days) cycles as observed in solar activity. The waves provide a new paradigm for internal magnetism and may drive the dynamos of Sun-like stars. Theoretical properties of the waves and observations can be used for magneto-seismological sounding of stellar interiors.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for orbital periods of polars with TESS. Methods, detection limits, and results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Determining the orbital periods of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) is essential for confirming candidates and for the understanding of their evolutionary state. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides month-long photometric data across nearly the entire sky that can be used to search for periodic variability in such systems. Aims. This study aims to identify and confirm the orbital periods for members of a recent compilation of magnetic CVs (known as polars) using TESS light curves. In addition, we set out to investigate their reliability, and hence the relevance of TESS for variability studies of CVs. Results. Ninety-five of the 217 polars in our sample have pipeline-produced TESS two-minute cadence light curves available. The results from our period search are overall in good agreement with the previously reported values. Out of the 95 analysed systems, 85 exhibit periods consistent with the literature values. Among the remaining ten objects, four are asynchronous polars, where TESS light curves resolve the orbital period, the white dwarf's spin period, and additional beat frequencies. For four systems, the periods detected from the TESS data differ from those previously reported. For two systems, a period detection was not possible. Our analysis of the flattened TESS light curves reveals a positive correlation between noise levels and TESS magnitude. Our noise level estimates resemble the rmsCDPP, a measure of white noise provided with the TESS pipeline products. However, our values for the noise level are systematically higher than the rmsCDPP indicating red noise and high-frequency signals hidden in the flattened light curves. Additionally, we present a statistical methodology to assess the reliability of period detections in TESS light curves. We find that for TESS magnitudes $\gtrsim$ 17, period detections become increasingly unreliable.</description>

      <title>The age and metallicity dependence of the near-infrared absolute magnitude and colour of red clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the age and metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude and colour of red clump (RC) stars is crucial for validating the accuracy of stellar evolution models and enhancing their reliability as a standard candle. However, this dependence has previously been investigated in the near-infrared across multiple bands only for -1.05 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ 0.40, a range accessible through the star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Therefore, we used star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way Galaxy to investigate the age and metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude and colour of RC stars in the near-infrared for a broader parameter space (0.45 $\leq$ Age (Gyr) $\leq$ 10.5, -1.65 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ 0.32). Comparison of our results with three isochronous models BaSTI, PARSEC, and MIST reveals that the age dependence of the absolute magnitude for young RC stars aligns well with theoretical predictions, within the fitting errors of the multiple regression analysis. Additionally, the observed colour shows good agreement with the theoretical models. Notably, the $J - K_{S}$ colour, which spans a wide parameter space, reproduces the distribution expected from the theoretical model.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi II: NIRSpec Spectroscopy and CO Modeling at 285 and 385 Days Past the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec 1.7--5.5 micron observations of SN~2024ggi at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. The late-time nebular spectra are dominated by emission lines from various ionization states of H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe. We also detect strong CO emission in both the first overtone and fundamental vibrational bands. Most atomic features exhibit asymmetric line profiles, indicating an aspherical explosion. Using observed fluxes combined with non-LTE radiative-transfer simulations, we develop a data-driven method that resolves the complex molecular-emission region, constrains its 3D structure, and reproduces high-fidelity spectral profiles. We find that, CO is mostly formed prior to +285d past explosion. The subsequent evolution is dominated by the evaporation of CO with CO mass varying from M(CO) of 8.7E-3 to 1.3E-3 Mo, and with instabilities growing from almost homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast f_c of 1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of CO only slightly decreases between epochs (v_1 of 1200 and 1100 km/sec), with the reference temperature dropping from T_1 of 2400 and 1900K.</description>

Abstract: The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo -- commonly attributed to strontium -- possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light -- and therefore the light travel time to an observer -- contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.</description>

      <title>deep-REMAP: Probabilistic Parameterization of Stellar Spectra Using Regularized Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.</description>

      <title>Population demographics of white dwarf binaries with intermediate separations: Gaia constraints on post-AGB mass transfer</title>

Abstract: Astrometry from the Gaia mission has revealed a large population of white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d. These systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the AU-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. We model the formation of AU-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. We test several models for the binaries' formation, including stable mass transfer with theoretically predicted stability criteria and two different formalisms for common envelope evolution. None of these models succeed in reproducing the observed component mass distributions or the absolute number of WD+MS binaries. The data are best reproduced by a model in which post-AGB binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds $\sim 0.4$. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{{\rm orb}}\propto P_{{\rm orb}}^{0.12}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\,M_{\odot}$. The model implies that $\sim 0.4\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>

Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Prioritized Community List of Potential Stellar Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. The TSS25 list categorizes potential HWO targets into priority tiers based on their likelihood to be surveyed and the necessity of obtaining observations of their stellar properties prior to the launch of the mission. This target list builds upon previous efforts to identify direct imaging targets and incorporates the results of multiple yield calculations assessing the science return of current design concepts for HWO. The TSS25 list identifies a sample of target stars that have a high probability to be observed by HWO (Tiers 1 and 2), independent of assumptions about the mission's final architecture. These stars should be the focus of community precursor science efforts in order to mitigate risks and maximize the science output of HWO. This target list is publicly available and is a living catalog that will be continually updated leading up to the mission.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra for the Photospheric Phase of a 3D Stripped-Envelope Supernova Explosion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present synthetic light curves and spectra from three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations based on a 3D core-collapse supernova explosion model of an ultra-stripped $3.5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor. Our calculations predict a fast and faint transient with $\Delta m_{15} \sim 1\texttt{-} 2\,\mathrm{mag}$ and peak bolometric luminosity between $-15.3\,\mathrm{mag}$ and $-16.4\,\mathrm{mag}$. Due to a large-scale unipolar asymmetry in the distribution of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, there is a pronounced viewing-angle dependence with about $1\,\mathrm{mag}$ difference between the directions of highest and lowest luminosity. The predicted spectra for this rare class of explosions do not yet match any observed counterpart. They are dominated by prominent Mg~II lines, but features from O, C, Si, and Ca are also found. In particular, the O~I line at \wl{7}{774} appears as a blended feature together with Mg~II emission. Our model is not only faster and fainter than the observed Ib/c supernova population, but also shows a correlation between higher peak luminosity and larger $\Delta m_{15}$ that is not present in observational samples. A possible explanation is that the unusually small ejecta mass of our model accentuates the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry. We suggest that the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry may be used to constrain asymmetries in explosion models of more typical stripped-envelope supernova progenitors in future.</description>

      <title>Luminous Late-time Radio Emission from Supernovae Interacting with Circumbinary Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse, with companions that best represent low-mass compact objects. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim 10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.</description>
