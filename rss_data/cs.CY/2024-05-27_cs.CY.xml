      <title>Probeable Problems for Beginner-level Programming-with-AI Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To broaden participation, competitive programming contests may include beginner-level problems that do not require knowledge of advanced Computer Science concepts (e.g., algorithms and data structures). However, since most participants have easy access to AI code-generation tools, these problems often become trivial to solve. For beginner-friendly programming contests that do not prohibit the use of AI tools, we propose Probeable Problems: code writing tasks that provide (1) a problem specification that deliberately omits certain details, and (2) a mechanism to probe for these details by asking clarifying questions and receiving immediate feedback. To evaluate our proposal, we conducted a 2-hour programming contest for undergraduate Computer Science students from multiple institutions, where each student was an active member of their institution's computing club. The contest comprised of six Probeable Problems for which a popular code-generation tool (GitHub Copilot) was unable to generate accurate solutions due to the absence of details. Students were permitted to work individually or in groups, and were free to use AI tools. We obtained consent from 26 groups (67 students) to use their submissions for research. We analyze the extent to which the code submitted by these groups identifies missing details and identify ways in which Probeable Problems can support learning in formal and informal CS educational contexts.</description>

      <title>Physiological Data: Challenges for Privacy and Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable devices that measure and record physiological signals are now becoming widely available to the general public with ever-increasing affordability and signal quality. The data from these devices introduce serious ethical challenges that remain largely unaddressed. Users do not always understand how these data can be leveraged to reveal private information about them and developers of these devices may not fully grasp how physiological data collected today could be used in the future for completely different purposes. We discuss the potential for wearable devices, initially designed to help users improve their well-being or enhance the experience of some digital application, to be appropriated in ways that extend far beyond their original intended purpose. We identify how the currently available technology can be misused, discuss how pairing physiological data with non-physiological data can radically expand the predictive capacity of physiological wearables, and explore the implications of these expanded capacities for a variety of stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Learning about Data, Algorithms, and Algorithmic Justice on TikTok in Personally Meaningful Ways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TikTok, a popular short video sharing application, emerged as the dominant social media platform for young people, with a pronounced influence on how young women and people of color interact online. The application has become a global space for youth to connect with each other, offering not only entertainment but also opportunities to engage with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-driven recommendations and create content using AI/M-powered tools, such as generative AI filters. This provides opportunities for youth to explore and question the inner workings of these systems, their implications, and even use them to advocate for causes they are passionate about. We present different perspectives on how youth may learn in personally meaningful ways when engaging with TikTok. We discuss how youth investigate how TikTok works (considering data and algorithms), take into account issues of ethics and algorithmic justice and use their understanding of the platform to advocate for change.</description>

      <title>Auditing the Fairness of COVID-19 Forecast Hub Case Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 Forecast Hub, a repository of COVID-19 forecasts from over 50 independent research groups, is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for their official COVID-19 communications. As such, the Forecast Hub is a critical centralized resource to promote transparent decision making. Nevertheless, by focusing exclusively on prediction accuracy, the Forecast Hub fails to evaluate whether the proposed models have similar performance across social determinants that have been known to play a role in the COVID-19 pandemic including race, ethnicity and urbanization level. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive fairness analysis of the Forecast Hub model predictions and we show statistically significant diverse predictive performance across social determinants, with minority racial and ethnic groups as well as less urbanized areas often associated with higher prediction errors. We hope this work will encourage COVID-19 modelers and the CDC to report fairness metrics together with accuracy, and to reflect on the potential harms of the models on specific social groups and contexts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Student Feedback Using Predictive Models in Visual Literacy Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer review is a popular feedback mechanism in higher education that actively engages students and provides researchers with a means to assess student engagement. However, there is little empirical support for the durability of peer review, particularly when using data predictive modeling to analyze student comments. This study uses Na\"ive Bayes modeling to analyze peer review data obtained from an undergraduate visual literacy course over five years. We expand on the research of Friedman and Rosen and Beasley et al. by focusing on the Na\"ive Bayes model of students' remarks. Our findings highlight the utility of Na\"ive Bayes modeling, particularly in the analysis of student comments based on parts of speech, where nouns emerged as the prominent category. Additionally, when examining students' comments using the visual peer review rubric, the lie factor emerged as the predominant factor. Comparing Na\"ive Bayes model to Beasley's approach, we found both help instructors map directions taken in the class, but the Na\"ive Bayes model provides a more specific outline for forecasting with a more detailed framework for identifying core topics within the course, enhancing the forecasting of educational directions. Through the application of the Holdout Method and $\mathrm{k}$-fold cross-validation with continuity correction, we have validated the model's predictive accuracy, underscoring its effectiveness in offering deep insights into peer review mechanisms. Our study findings suggest that using predictive modeling to assess student comments can provide a new way to better serve the students' classroom comments on their visual peer work. This can benefit courses by inspiring changes to course content, reinforcement of course content, modification of projects, or modifications to the rubric itself.</description>

      <title>GPT is Not an Annotator: The Necessity of Human Annotation in Fairness Benchmark Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social biases in LLMs are usually measured via bias benchmark datasets. Current benchmarks have limitations in scope, grounding, quality, and human effort required. Previous work has shown success with a community-sourced, rather than crowd-sourced, approach to benchmark development. However, this work still required considerable effort from annotators with relevant lived experience. This paper explores whether an LLM (specifically, GPT-3.5-Turbo) can assist with the task of developing a bias benchmark dataset from responses to an open-ended community survey. We also extend the previous work to a new community and set of biases: the Jewish community and antisemitism. Our analysis shows that GPT-3.5-Turbo has poor performance on this annotation task and produces unacceptable quality issues in its output. Thus, we conclude that GPT-3.5-Turbo is not an appropriate substitute for human annotation in sensitive tasks related to social biases, and that its use actually negates many of the benefits of community-sourcing bias benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Legal Risk Taxonomy for Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, this paper presents a taxonomy of legal risks associated with generative AI (GenAI) by breaking down complex legal concepts to provide a common understanding of potential legal challenges for developing and deploying GenAI models. The methodology is based on (1) examining the legal claims that have been filed in existing lawsuits and (2) evaluating the reasonably foreseeable legal claims that may be filed in future lawsuits. First, we identified 29 lawsuits against prominent GenAI entities and tallied the claims of each lawsuit. From there, we identified seven claims that are cited at least four times across these lawsuits as the most likely claims for future GenAI lawsuits. For each of these seven claims, we describe the elements of the claim (what the plaintiff must prove to prevail) and provide an example of how it may apply to GenAI. Next, we identified 30 other potential claims that we consider to be more speculative, because they have been included in fewer than four lawsuits or have yet to be filed. We further separated those 30 claims into 19 that are most likely to be made in relation to pre-deployment of GenAI models and 11 that are more likely to be made in connection with post-deployment of GenAI models since the legal risks will vary between entities that create versus deploy them. For each of these claims, we describe the elements of the claim and the potential remedies that plaintiffs may seek to help entities determine their legal risks in developing or deploying GenAI. Lastly, we close the paper by noting the novelty of GenAI technology and propose some applications for the paper's taxonomy in driving further research.</description>

      <title>Proportional Fairness in Clustering: A Social Choice Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the proportional clustering problem of Chen et al. [ICML'19] and relate it to the area of multiwinner voting in computational social choice. We show that any clustering satisfying a weak proportionality notion of Brill and Peters [EC'23] simultaneously obtains the best known approximations to the proportional fairness notion of Chen et al. [ICML'19], but also to individual fairness [Jung et al., FORC'20] and the "core" [Li et al. ICML'21]. In fact, we show that any approximation to proportional fairness is also an approximation to individual fairness and vice versa. Finally, we also study stronger notions of proportional representation, in which deviations do not only happen to single, but multiple candidate centers, and show that stronger proportionality notions of Brill and Peters [EC'23] imply approximations to these stronger guarantees.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harm reporting in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently operates on an ad hoc basis, lacking a structured process for disclosing or addressing algorithmic flaws. In contrast, the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) ethos and ecosystem play a pivotal role in software security and transparency. Globally, there are ongoing efforts to establish frameworks that promote transparency and collaboration in addressing AI-related issues, though challenges persist. Algorithmic flaws in machine learning (ML) models present distinct challenges compared to traditional software vulnerabilities, warranting a specialized approach. To address this gap, we propose the implementation of a dedicated Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored to the intricacies of machine learning and artificial intelligence issues. This paper delves into the historical landscape of disclosures in ML, encompassing the ad hoc reporting of harms and the emergence of participatory auditing. By juxtaposing these practices with the well-established disclosure norms in cybersecurity, we argue that the broader adoption of CFD has the potential to enhance public trust through transparent processes that carefully balance the interests of both organizations and the community.</description>
