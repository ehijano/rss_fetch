      <title>CosyEdit: Unlocking End-to-End Speech Editing Capability from Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech editing aims to modify spoken content based on textual instructions, yet traditional cascade systems suffer from complex preprocessing pipelines and a reliance on explicit external temporal alignment. Addressing these limitations, we propose CosyEdit, an end-to-end speech editing model adapted from CosyVoice through task-specific fine-tuning and an optimized inference procedure, which internalizes speech-text alignment while ensuring high consistency between the speech before and after editing. By fine-tuning on only 250 hours of supervised data from our curated GigaEdit dataset, our 400M-parameter model achieves reliable speech editing performance. Experiments on the RealEdit benchmark indicate that CosyEdit not only outperforms several billion-parameter language model baselines but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art cascade approaches. These results demonstrate that, with task-specific fine-tuning and inference optimization, robust and efficient speech editing capabilities can be unlocked from a zero-shot TTS model, yielding a novel and cost-effective end-to-end solution for high-quality speech editing.</description>

      <title>SPAM: Style Prompt Adherence Metric for Prompt-based TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-based text-to-speech (TTS) aims to generate speech that adheres to fine-grained style cues provided in a text prompt. However, most prior works depend on neither plausible nor faithful measures to evaluate prompt adherence. That is, they cannot ensure whether the evaluation is grounded on the prompt and is similar to a human. Thus, we present a new automatic metric, the Style Prompt Adherence Metric, which explicitly satisfies both plausibility and faithfulness. Inspired by the CLAP, our approach factorizes speech into acoustic attributes and aligns them with the style prompt. Also, we trained the scorer with a supervised contrastive loss, which could provide a clearer distinction between different semantics. We conducted two experiments on two perspectives. The plausibility experiment showed that SPAM achieved a strong correlation with the mean opinion score (MOS). Also, the faithfulness experiment demonstrated that SPAM is successfully grounded to the given style prompt, as it can discriminate different semantics of the prompt. We believe that SPAM can provide a viable automatic solution for evaluating style prompt adherence of synthesized speech.</description>

      <title>The ICASSP 2026 HumDial Challenge: Benchmarking Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Audio-LLMs and Omni-models, spoken dialogue systems have evolved significantly, progressively narrowing the gap between human-machine and human-human interactions. Achieving truly ``human-like'' communication necessitates a dual capability: emotional intelligence to perceive and resonate with users' emotional states, and robust interaction mechanisms to navigate the dynamic, natural flow of conversation, such as real-time turn-taking. Therefore, we launched the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) at ICASSP 2026 to benchmark these dual capabilities. Anchored by a sizable dataset derived from authentic human conversations, this initiative establishes a fair evaluation platform across two tracks: (1) Emotional Intelligence, targeting long-term emotion understanding and empathetic generation; and (2) Full-Duplex Interaction, systematically evaluating real-time decision-making under `` listening-while-speaking'' conditions. This paper summarizes the dataset, track configurations, and the final results.</description>

      <title>Closing the Modality Reasoning Gap for Speech Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although speech large language models have achieved notable progress, a substantial modality reasoning gap remains: their reasoning performance on speech inputs is markedly weaker than on text. This gap could be associated with representational drift across Transformer layers and behavior deviations in long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce TARS, a reinforcement-learning framework that aligns text-conditioned and speech-conditioned trajectories through an asymmetric reward design. The framework employs two dense and complementary signals: representation alignment, which measures layer-wise hidden-state similarity between speech- and text-conditioned trajectories, and behavior alignment, which evaluates semantic consistency between generated outputs and reference text completions. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MMSU and OBQA, show that our approach significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.</description>

      <title>Discriminative-Generative Target Speaker Extraction with Decoder-Only Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to recover the speech signal of a desired speaker from a mixed audio recording, given a short enrollment utterance. Most existing TSE approaches are based on discriminative modeling paradigms. Although effective at suppressing interfering speakers, these methods often struggle to produce speech with high perceptual quality and naturalness. To address this limitation, we first propose LauraTSE, a generative TSE model built upon an auto-regressive decoder-only language model. However, purely generative approaches may suffer from hallucinations, content drift, and limited controllability, which may undermine their reliability in complex acoustic scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we further introduce a discriminative-generative TSE framework. In this framework, a discriminative front-end is employed to robustly extract the target speaker's speech, yielding stable and controllable intermediate representations. A generative back-end then operates in the neural audio codec representation space to reconstruct fine-grained speech details and enhance perceptual quality. This two-stage design effectively combines the robustness and controllability of discriminative models with the superior naturalness and quality enhancement capabilities of generative models. Moreover, we systematically investigate collaborative training strategies for the proposed framework, including freezing or fine-tuning the front-end, incorporating an auxiliary SI-SDR loss, and exploring both auto-regressive and non-auto-regressive inference mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a more favorable trade-off among speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.</description>

      <title>Detect All-Type Deepfake Audio: Wavelet Prompt Tuning for Enhanced Auditory Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of audio generation technologies has escalated the risks of malicious deepfake audio across speech, sound, singing voice, and music, threatening multimedia security and trust. While existing countermeasures (CMs) perform well in single-type audio deepfake detection (ADD), their performance declines in cross-type scenarios. This paper is dedicated to studying the all-type ADD task. We are the first to comprehensively establish an all-type ADD benchmark to evaluate current CMs, incorporating cross-type deepfake detection across speech, sound, singing voice, and music. Then, we introduce the prompt tuning self-supervised learning (PT-SSL) training paradigm, which optimizes SSL front-end by learning specialized prompt tokens for ADD, requiring 458x fewer trainable parameters than fine-tuning (FT). Considering the auditory perception of different audio types, we propose the wavelet prompt tuning (WPT)-SSL method to capture type-invariant auditory deepfake information from the frequency domain without requiring additional training parameters, thereby enhancing performance over FT in the all-type ADD task. To achieve an universally CM, we utilize all types of deepfake audio for co-training. Experimental results demonstrate that WPT-XLSR-AASIST achieved the best performance, with an average EER of 3.58% across all evaluation sets.</description>

      <title>Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA): A Black-box Adversarial Attack against Voice Authentication and Anti-Spoofing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio. While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions. SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks capable of evolving with the threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Zero-Day Audio DeepFake Detection via Retrieval Augmentation and Profile Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern audio deepfake detectors built on foundation models and large training datasets achieve promising detection performance. However, they struggle with zero-day attacks, where the audio samples are generated by novel synthesis methods that models have not seen from reigning training data. Conventional approaches fine-tune the detector, which can be problematic when prompt response is needed. This paper proposes a training-free retrieval-augmented framework for zero-day audio deepfake detection that leverages knowledge representations and voice profile matching. Within this framework, we propose simple yet effective retrieval and ensemble methods that reach performance comparable to supervised baselines and their fine-tuned counterparts on the DeepFake-Eval-2024 benchmark, without any additional model training. We also conduct ablation on voice profile attributes, and demonstrate the cross-database generalizability of the framework with introducing simple and training-free fusion strategies.</description>

      <title>IndexTTS 2.5 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In prior work, we introduced IndexTTS 2, a zero-shot neural text-to-speech foundation model comprising two core components: a transformer-based Text-to-Semantic (T2S) module and a non-autoregressive Semantic-to-Mel (S2M) module, which together enable faithful emotion replication and establish the first autoregressive duration-controllable generative paradigm. Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.</description>
