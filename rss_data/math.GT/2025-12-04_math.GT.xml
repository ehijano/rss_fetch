      <title>Relative Thom Conjectures, symplectic and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a criterion that ensures a bounded almost complex curve in a bounded almost complex 4-manifold minimizes genus amongst all smooth surfaces that share its homology class and the transverse link on its boundary. An immediate corollary affirms the relative symplectic Thom conjecture and, moreover, yields obstructions coming from knot Floer homology to a link bounding a symplectic surface in a symplectic filling. Our results are applicable to knots in manifolds equipped with plane fields that admit no symplectic fillings; for instance, we show that symplectic surfaces in a thickening of any contact 3-manifold with non-zero Ozsvath-Szabo invariant minimize slice genus for their boundary. We conjecture that this phenomenon occurs precisely when the contact structure is tight, which would imply that tightness can be viewed as a symplecto-geometric notion.</description>

      <title>Constructing Lefschetz Fibrations with Arbitrary Slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any real number $r\in (2,8)$, there exists a genus-$g$ Lefschetz fibration over the two-sphere with large enough genus-$g$ having the slope arbitrarily close to $r$. It is known that any genus-$g$ hyperelliptic Lefschetz fibration with only nonseparating vanishing cycles has the slope $4-4/g$. We prove that the converse does not hold by showing that there exists a nonhyperelliptic genus-$g$ Lefschetz fibration with only nonseparating vanishing cycles having slope $4-4/g$.</description>

      <title>Monodromy and vanishing cycles for sufficiently ample linear systems on simply connected surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the mapping class group-valued monodromy of any sufficiently ample linear system on any smooth simply connected projective surface, identifying this with the r-spin mapping class group associated to a maximal root of the adjoint line bundle. This gives a characterization of the simple closed curves that can arise as vanishing cycles for nodal degenerations in the linear system, as well as other corollaries concerning discriminants, Lefschetz fibrations, and surfaces in 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Well-quasi-orders on embedded planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central theorem of topological graph theory states that the graph minor relation is a well-quasi-order on graphs. It has far-reaching consequences, in particular in the study of graph structures and the design of (parameterized) algorithms. In this article, we study two embedded versions of classical minor relations from structural graph theory and prove that they are also well-quasi-orders on general or restricted classes of embedded planar graphs. These embedded minor relations appear naturally for intrinsically embedded objects, such as knot diagrams and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  Handling the extra topological constraints of the embeddings requires careful analysis and extensions of classical methods for the more constrained embedded minor relations. We prove that the embedded version of immersion induces a well-quasi-order on bounded carving-width plane graphs by exhibiting particularly well-structured tree-decompositions and leveraging a classical argument on well-quasi-orders on forests. We deduce that the embedded graph minor relation defines a well-quasi-order on plane graphs via their directed medial graphs, when their branch-width is bounded. We conclude that the embedded graph minor relation is a well-quasi-order on all plane graphs, using classical grids theorems in the unbounded branch-width case.</description>

      <title>Fibered ribbon pretzels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify fibered ribbon pretzel knots up to mutation. The classification is complete, except perhaps for members of Lecuona's ``exceptional'' family of [Lec15]. The result is obtained by combining lattice embedding techniques with Gabai's classification of fibered pretzel knots, and exhibiting ribbon disks, some of which lie outside of known patterns for standard pretzel projections.</description>

      <title>A new proof of Milnor-Wood inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14553v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milnor-Wood inequality states that if a (topological) oriented circle bundle over an orientable surface of genus $g$ has a smooth transverse foliation, then the Euler class of the bundle satisfies $$|\mathcal{E}|\leq 2g-2.$$ We give a new proof of the inequality based on a (previously proven by the authors) local formula which computes $\mathcal{E}$ from the singularities of a quasisection.
  We also sketch two other proofs: one based on Poincar\`{e} rotation number theory, and the other of topological nature.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the space of flags of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ transverse to a fixed pair and restrictions on Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We count and give a parametrization of connected components in the space of flags transverse to a given transverse pair in every flag varieties of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and, using methods of Dey--Greenberg--Riestenberg, we show that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit computation of some Pl\"ucker coordinates to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>

      <title>On The Topology of Polygonal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is an introductory and informal exposition on the topology of polygonal meshes. We begin with a broad overview of topological notions and discuss how homeomorphisms, homotopy, and homology can be used to characterize topology. We move on to define polygonal meshes and make a distinction between intrinsic topology and extrinsic topology which depends on the embedding space. A distinction is also made between quantitative topological properties and qualitative properties. We outline a proof of the Euler and the Euler-Poincar\'e formulas. The Betti numbers are defined in terms of the Euler-Poincar\'e formula and other mesh statistics rather than as cardinalities of the homology groups which allows us to avoid abstract algebra. Finally, we discuss how it is possible to cut a polygonal mesh such that it becomes a topological disc.</description>

      <title>Embedded topological triviality of separable families of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how singularities behave under small perturbations is a central theme in singularity theory. In this paper we establish sufficient conditions for families of analytic function-germs on a germ of a complex analytic space to admit an embedded topological trivialization. Our results extend previous work of the third author and collaborators, moving from abstract triviality to the embedded setting. As an application, we obtain new instances of topological stability, including a broad class of $\mu$-constant deformations. These findings provide a new insight into the long-standing $\mu$-constant conjecture, one of the major open problems in the field.</description>
