      <title>Fatal errors and misuse of mathematics in the Hong-Page Theorem and Landemore's epistemic argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of understanding collective intelligence, the Hong-Page Theorems have been presented as cornerstones of the interplay between diversity and ability. However, upon rigorous examination, there seem to be inherent problems and misinterpretations within these theorems. H\'el\`ene Landemore's application of these results in her epistemic argument and her political proposal showcases a invalid use of mathematical principles. This paper critically dissects the Hong-Page Theorems, revealing significant inconsistencies and oversights, and underscores the indispensable role of ``ability" in group problem-solving contexts. This paper aims not to undermine the importance of diversity, but rather to highlight the dangers of misusing mathematical principles and the necessity for a more careful analysis of mathematical results when applying them to social sciences.d the necessity for a more nuanced comprehension of mathematical results when applying them to social sciences.</description>

      <title>Voting with Partial Orders: The Plurality and Anti-Plurality Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17413v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Plurality rule for linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to partial orders, offering axiomatic characterisations for these extensions.\\ \textbf{Keywords:} Plurality, Anti-Plurality, Strict Partial Orders, Voting.</description>

      <title>Information Design with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical information design models (e.g., Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk) require players to have perfect knowledge of the prior distribution of the state of the world. Our paper studies repeated persuasion problems in which the information designer does not know the prior. The information designer learns to design signaling schemes from repeated interactions with the receiver. We design learning algorithms for the information designer to achieve no regret compared to using the optimal signaling scheme with known prior, under two models of the receiver's decision-making. (1) The first model assumes that the receiver knows the prior and can perform posterior update and best respond to signals. In this model, we design a learning algorithm for the information designer with $O(\log T)$ regret in the general case, and another algorithm with $\Theta(\log \log T)$ regret in the case where the receiver has only two actions. (2) The second model assumes that the receiver does not know the prior and employs a no-regret learning algorithm to take actions. We show that the information designer can achieve regret $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{rReg}(T) T})$, where $\mathrm{rReg}(T)=o(T)$ is an upper bound on the receiver's learning regret. Our work thus provides a learning foundation for the problem of information design with unknown prior.</description>
