      <title>Pair Wavefunction Symmetry in UTe2 from Zero-Energy Surface State Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16636v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in UTe2, its superconductive order-parameter $\Delta_k$ remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral $\Delta_k$ via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that $\Delta_k$ of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.</description>

      <title>Ultra-strong coupling of two ferromagnets via Meissner currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.</description>

      <title>A sturdy spin-momentum locking in a chiral organic superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among noncentrosymmetric structures, chirality has recently been recognized as a novel source of asymmetrical charge/spin transports as exemplified by electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMChA) and chirality-induced spin selectivity. Although similar bulk-charge rectification and Rashba-Edelstein effect in polar systems are quantitively reproducible by theory based on the electronic band structures, the relevance of band parameters in chiral effects remains elusive. Here, by working with a chiral organic superconductor, we experimentally demonstrate a gigantic EMChA and large superconducting diode effect, both of which are difficult to be explained solely by its band parameters. A two-critical-current signature and an enhanced critical field suggested triplet-mixed Cooper pairs with anomalously enhanced spin-orbit coupling above atomic limit. Our results clearly highlight a unique spin-momentum locking with large stiffness beyond the expectation, suggesting an unknown driving force for spin polarization inherent to chirality.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Upper critical field and colossal spin valve analogy in normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of spin orbit interaction in superconducting proximity effect is an area of intense research effort. Recent theoretical and experimental works investigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating spin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey of thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb superconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single layers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction and resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of the upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the trilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that the trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as 2-dimensional superconductors. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, the trilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane applied magnetic field. This suppression of critical temperature under field rotation is analogous to the colossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic materials, however in our trilayers only orbital contributions to the suppression are present.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconducting Phase Diagram of Monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) and fluctuations around it are believed to be important for understanding the phase diagram in unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, iron pnictides, and heavy fermion superconductors. However, the QCP is usually buried deep within the superconducting dome and is difficult to investigate. The connection between quantum critical fluctuations and superconductivity remains an outstanding problem in condensed matter. Here combining both electrical transport and Nernst experiments, we explicitly demonstrate the onset of superconductivity at an unconventional QCP in gate-tuned monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), with features incompatible with the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) scenario. The results lead to a novel superconducting phase diagram that is distinguished from other known superconductors. Two distinct gate-tuned quantum phase transitions are observed at the ends of the superconducting dome. We find that quantum fluctuations around the QCP of the underdoped regime are essential for understanding how the monolayer superconductivity is established. The unconventional phase diagram we report here illustrates a previously unknown relation between superconductivity and QCP.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical approach for computing and analyzing two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems. Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive the nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps with particular emphasis on the rephasing sector, which allows to disentangle different sources of broadening. Our many-body approach successfully distinguishes elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms contributing to the excitation linewidth. Additionally, using a non-perturbative conserving approach, we demonstrate that the echo peak exhibits a universal asymmetric shape in the sole presence of static disorder, a feature that remains robust against quantum fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the standard theory based on isolated two-level systems, which fails to account for the dispersive nature of excitations and the interactions between different momentum components.</description>

      <title>Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16872v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting in the nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has drawn great attention. However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature due to multiband effect in the topological nodal-line semimetal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic study of the normal-state and superconducting properties of single crystal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$ $(0\leq x \leq 0.23)$. Sn doping enhances the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$ up to 5.1 K while also significantly increasing impurity scattering in the crystals. For $x=0$ and 0.018, the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ exceeds the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) weak-coupling value of 1.43, indicating the realization of strong-coupling superconductivity in undoped and slightly Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$. Substituting Pb with more Sn lowers the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ below the BSC value of 1.43, which cannot be explained by a single-gap model. Rather, the observed specific heat data of moderately Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$ ($x= 0.08$ and 0.15) are reproduced by a two-gap model. Our observations suggest that additional Fermi pockets appear due to a reduction of the spin-orbit gap with Sn doping, and the multiband effect arising from these emergent Fermi pockets enhances the effective electron-phonon coupling strength, leading to the increase in $T_{c}$ of Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Diagonal Double-Stripe Spin-Density-Wave and Potential Superconductivity in Bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and the potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector ${Q}\approx(0,\pm0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From the view of the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to ${Q}_0\approx\pm(0.58\pi,0.58\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by Fermi surfaces nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ much lower than that under high pressure. Further more, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC at AP.</description>

      <title>Melting through Barrier-Crossing: The Role of Equilibrium Thermally Activated Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Melting is often understood in purely equilibrium terms, where crystalline order disappears once the free energy of the solid equals that of the liquid. Yet at the microscopic level, the initiating events for melting can often be traced to the formation of defects or local ``jumps'' over interatomic barriers. In this work, we offer a unified interpretation of melting by focusing on the equilibrium fraction of particles whose energy exceeds a characteristic barrier \(E_a\). We show that when this fraction surpasses a small but critical threshold \cite{Feder1958,Kraftmakher1998} (on the order of \(10^{-4}\)-\(10^{-3}\)), the crystal loses its rigidity, thus reconciling Born's mechanical-instability picture with the older Lindemann notion of large atomic displacements. We derive this threshold condition from standard Boltzmann (and Bose/Fermi) statistics, ensuring consistency with standard thermodynamics. Our approach naturally extends to vortex lattices in superconductors (where vortex activation energies play the role of \(E_a\)) and to quantum-lattice systems (Hubbard-type models). Crucially, while the interpretation emphasizes barrier crossing, the criterion itself is built on equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a transparent link between defect formation rates and the macroscopic transition.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Theory of Correlated Insulator(s) and Superconductor at $\nu=1$ in Twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</description>
