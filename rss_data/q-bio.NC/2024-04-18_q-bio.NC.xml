      <title>Generating synthetic electroretinogram waveforms using Artificial Intelligence to improve classification of retinal conditions in under-represented populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual electrophysiology is often used clinically to determine functional changes associated with retinal or neurological conditions. The full-field flash electroretinogram (ERG) assesses the global contribution of the outer and inner retinal layers initiated by the rods and cone pathways depending on the state of retinal adaptation. Within clinical centers reference normative data are used to compare with clinical cases that may be rare or underpowered in a specific demographic. To bolster either reference or case datasets the application of synthetic ERG waveforms may offer benefits to disease classification and case-control studies. In this study and as a proof of concept, artificial intelligence (AI) to generate synthetic signals using Generative Adversarial Networks is deployed to up-scale male participants within an ISCEV reference dataset containing 32 participants, with waveforms from the right and left eye. Random Forest Classifiers further improved classification for sex within the group from a balanced accuracy of 0.72 to 0.83 with the added synthetic male waveforms. This is the first study to demonstrate the generation of synthetic ERG waveforms to improve machine learning classification modelling with electroretinogram waveforms.</description>

      <title>Neuropsychological Effects of Rock Steady Boxing in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of adapted boxing, specifically Rock Steady Boxing, in mitigating dopamine decline in individuals with Parkinson disease. The research involved 40 participants with confirmed diagnosis of Parkinson disease who underwent biweekly RSB sessions over an 8 week period. Training regimen included activation, core exercise, and a cooldown phase. The findings revealed a significant amelioration in depressive symptoms through the sessions. Assessment using the Beck Depression Inventory demonstrated a progressive decrease in scores associated with depressive symptoms, particularly affective, cognitive, and somatic symptoms. The reduction in more severe symptoms was accompanied by an increase in milder symptoms. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of the reduction in depressive symptoms over time, suggesting that physical activity, particularly RSB, may contribute to enhancing the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson disease. The positive impact was observed in both motor and depressive symptoms, suggesting an overall beneficial effect of exercise training. It is important to note that six participants withdrew from the study due to organizational reasons, resulting in a reduction in the participant count from 40 to 34. Nonetheless, the overall results suggest that RSB could be an effective approach to addressing depression in Parkinson patients, providing a complementary treatment option to conventional pharmacological therapy.</description>

      <title>Automated mapping of virtual environments with visual predictive coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans construct internal cognitive maps of their environment directly from sensory inputs without access to a system of explicit coordinates or distance measurements. While machine learning algorithms like SLAM utilize specialized visual inference procedures to identify visual features and construct spatial maps from visual and odometry data, the general nature of cognitive maps in the brain suggests a unified mapping algorithmic strategy that can generalize to auditory, tactile, and linguistic inputs. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding provides a natural and versatile neural network algorithm for constructing spatial maps using sensory data. We introduce a framework in which an agent navigates a virtual environment while engaging in visual predictive coding using a self-attention-equipped convolutional neural network. While learning a next image prediction task, the agent automatically constructs an internal representation of the environment that quantitatively reflects distances. The internal map enables the agent to pinpoint its location relative to landmarks using only visual information.The predictive coding network generates a vectorized encoding of the environment that supports vector navigation where individual latent space units delineate localized, overlapping neighborhoods in the environment. Broadly, our work introduces predictive coding as a unified algorithmic framework for constructing cognitive maps that can naturally extend to the mapping of auditory, sensorimotor, and linguistic inputs.</description>
