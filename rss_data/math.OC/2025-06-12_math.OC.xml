      <title>On Polynomial Stochastic Barrier Functions: Bernstein Versus Sum-of-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) certify the safety of stochastic systems by formulating a functional optimization problem, which state-of-the-art methods solve using Sum-of-Squares (SoS) polynomials. This work focuses on polynomial SBFs and introduces a new formulation based on Bernstein polynomials and provides a comparative analysis of its theoretical and empirical performance against SoS methods. We show that the Bernstein formulation leads to a linear program (LP), in contrast to the semi-definite program (SDP) required for SoS, and that its relaxations exhibit favorable theoretical convergence properties. However, our empirical results reveal that the Bernstein approach struggles to match SoS in practical performance, exposing an intriguing gap between theoretical advantages and real-world feasibility.</description>

      <title>Risk-based Design Optimization for Powder Bed Fusion Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powder bed fusion is a widely used additive manufacturing (AM) process for producing complex, small-batch parts that are impractical to manufacture using conventional methods. However, its broader adoption is hindered by process-induced defects. The challenge in AM stems from inherent material and process uncertainties. Therefore, it is critical to account for these uncertainties in the design optimization and control of powder bed fusion AM processes. In this work, we formulate and solve a design optimization problem under uncertainty for a powder bed fusion metal AM process. Our objective is to minimize energy consumption while enforcing a risk-based constraint formulated with a buffered probability of failure on residual stress, along with a constraint on melting temperature to ensure a successful build. We use surrogate models for the residual stress and temperature snapshots to accelerate optimization; we train these models using data from high-fidelity finite element simulations. We validate the optimization results through additional high-fidelity simulations. The validated results demonstrate that the proposed optimization reduces energy consumption, enhances process reliability, and contributes to more robust and sustainable additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>A thorough study of Riemannian Newton's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a thorough numerical study of Riemannian Newton's Method (RNM) for optimization problems, with a focus on the Grassmannian and on the Stiefel manifold. We compare the Riemannian formulation of Newton's Method with its classical Euclidean counterpart based on Lagrange multipliers by applying both approaches to the important and challenging Hartree--Fock energy minimization problem from Quantum Chemistry. Experiments on a dataset of 125 molecules show that the Riemannian approaches achieve higher convergence rates, require fewer iterations, and exhibit greater robustness to the choice of initial guess. In this work we also analyze the numerical issues that arise from using Newton's Method on the total manifold when the cost function is defined on the quotient manifold. We investigate the performance of a modified RNM in which we ignore the small eigenvalues of the Hessian and the results indicate that this modified method is stable and performs on par with the RNM on the quotient manifold.</description>

      <title>Turnpike Property of Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control Problems in Large Horizons with Regime Switching I: Homogeneous Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with optimal control problems for a linear homogeneous stochastic differential equation having regime switching with purely quadratic functional in the large time horizons. We establish the so-called turnpike properties for the optimal pairs. The key is to prove a proper convergence of the solutions to the differential Riccati equations to the algebraic Riccati equation. Even for the problems without regime switchings, our result provides a refined estimate compared to those in the previous literature, which also provides a new tool for further research.</description>

      <title>A reconsideration of quasimonotone variational inequality problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is based on Tseng's exgradient algorithm for solving variational inequality problems in real Hilbert spaces. Under the assumptions that the cost operator is quasimonotone and Lipschitz continuous, we establish the strong convergence, sublinear convergence, and Q-linear convergence of the algorithm. The results of this paper provide new insights into quasimonotone variational inequality problems, extending and enriching existing results in the literature. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and implementability of our proposed condition and algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Pseudo-Parabolic KWC Systems for Grain Boundary Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KWC system is a well-known generic framework for phase-field models of grain boundary motion, whose original formulation is given as a parabolic gradient flow of a free energy. In the original KWC system, the results of uniqueness have been relatively scarce compared to other issues, such as existence, qualitative behavior, and numerics. This lack of progress has posed a significant challenge for more advanced topics, including optimal control. To overcome this, the authors have recently introduced the pseudo-parabolic structure to simultaneously preserve the gradient flow nature of free-energy, and to ensure the well-posedness including the uniqueness. The goal of this paper is to study an optimization problem constrained by pseudo-parabolic KWC system. The theory will be developed through a series of Main Theorems concerning the existence and semi-continuous dependence of optimal controls, and first-order necessary conditions for optimality.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Curbside Congestion Effects of Ride-hailing Services for Morning Commute using Bi-modal Two-Tandem Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of ride-hailing services, curb space in urban areas has become highly congested due to the massive passenger pick-ups and drop-offs. Particularly during peak hours, the massive ride-hailing vehicles waiting to drop off obstruct curb spaces and even disrupt the flow of mainline traffic. However, there is a lack of an analytical model that formulates and mitigates the congestion effects of ride-hailing drop-offs in curb spaces. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel bi-modal two-tandem bottleneck model to depict the commuting behaviors of private vehicles (PVs) and ride-hailing vehicles (RVs) during the morning peak in a linear city. In the model, the upstream bottleneck models the congestion on highways, and the downstream curbside bottlenecks depict the congestion caused by RV drop-offs in curb spaces, PV queue on main roads, and the spillover effects between them in the urban area. The proposed model can be solved in a closed form under eight different scenarios. A time-varying optimal congestion pricing scheme, combined curbside pricing and parking pricing, is proposed to achieve the social optimum. It is found that potential waste of road capacity could occur when there is a mismatch between the highway and curbside bottlenecks, and hence the optimal pricing should be determined in a coordinated manner. A real-world case from Hong Kong shows that the limited curb space and main road in the urban area could be the major congestion bottleneck. Expanding the capacity of the curb space or the main road in the urban area, rather than the highway bottleneck, can effectively reduce social costs. This paper highlights the critical role of curbside management and provides policy implications for the coordinated management of highways and curb spaces.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean dual gradient ascent for entropically regularized linear and semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimization framework that exhibits dimension-independent convergence on a broad class of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</description>

      <title>Empirical and computer-aided robustness analysis of long-step and accelerated methods in smooth convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09730v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations. Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability-Based Optimal Grid Defense Strategies for Enhancing Cyber-Physical Energy System Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach is proposed to identify optimal asset protection strategies based on vulnerability assessment outcomes. Traditional bilevel attacker-defender models emphasize worstcase scenarios but offer limited defensive guidance. In contrast, trilevel models introduce high computational complexity and rely on fixed network configurations. The proposed critical-components method leverages vulnerability assessment results to determine protection strategies, effectively outsourcing the upper-level defense decision. This enables adaptability to diverse network topologies, assessment techniques, and cyber-physical energy systems without the overhead of multi-level optimization. Case studies demonstrate the potential for improved system resilience across varying operational conditions.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Riemannian Proximal Gradient Method for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the proximal gradient method on Riemannian manifolds for functions that are possibly not geodesically convex. Starting from the forward-backward-splitting, we define an intrinsic variant of the proximal gradient method that uses proximal maps defined on the manifold and therefore does not require or work in the embedding. We investigate its convergence properties and illustrate its numerical performance, particularly for nonconvex or nonembedded problems that are hence out of reach for other methods.</description>

      <title>A Saddle Point Algorithm for Robust Data-Driven Factor Model Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the factor model problem, which aims to uncover low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional datasets. Adopting a robust data-driven approach, we formulate the problem as a saddle-point optimization. Our primary contribution is a general first-order algorithm that solves this reformulation by leveraging a linear minimization oracle (LMO). We further develop semi-closed form solutions (up to a scalar) for three specific LMOs, corresponding to the Frobenius norm, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Gelbrich (aka Wasserstein) distance. The analysis includes explicit quantification of these LMOs' regularity conditions, notably the Lipschitz constants of the dual function, whthich govern the algorithm's convergence performance. Numerical experiments confirm our meod's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings, outperforming standard off-the-shelf optimization solvers.</description>

      <title>A matheuristic for solving the single row facility layout problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is a well-studied NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in manufacturing and logistics systems. In the SRFLP, a set of
  facilities with lengths is given, as well as weights between each pair of facilities. The facilities must be
  arranged on a line, such that the sum of the weighted center-to-center distances is minimized. In this
  work, we introduce a novel matheuristic approach that integrates exact optimization into a metaheuristic framework based on simulated annealing to effectively solve large-scale SRFLP instances.
  Specifically, we propose the window approach matheuristic, which solves subsegments of the layout
  to optimality using mixed-integer programming while preserving the ordering of facilities outside the
  window. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first matheuristic approach specifically
  designed for the SRFLP. We evaluate the performance of our method on the widely-used benchmark
  instance sets from literature. The computational results demonstrate that our matheuristic improves
  the best-known solution values for 17 of 70 instances, and matches the best-known solution values
  for the remaining 53 instances, outperforming current state-of-the-art metaheuristics.</description>

      <title>Balanced quasistatic evolutions of critical points in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasistatic evolutions of critical points of time-dependent energies exhibit piecewise smooth behavior, making them useful for modeling continuum mechanics phenomena like elastic-plasticity and fracture. Traditionally, such evolutions have been derived as vanishing viscosity and inertia limits, leading to balanced viscosity solutions. However, for nonconvex energies, these constructions have been realized in Euclidean spaces and assume non-degenerate critical points. In this paper, we take a different approach by decoupling the time scales of the energy evolution and of the transition to equilibria. Namely, starting from an equilibrium configuration, we let the energy evolve, while keeping frozen the system state; then, we update the state by freezing the energy, while letting the system transit via gradient flow or an approximation of it (e.g., minimizing movement or backward differentiation schemes). This approach has several advantages. It aligns with the physical principle that systems transit through energy-minimizing steady states. It is also fully constructive and computationally implementable, with physical and computational costs governed by appropriate action functionals. Additionally, our analysis is simpler and more general than previous formulations in the literature, as it does not require non-degenerate critical points. Finally, this approach extends to evolutions in locally compact metric path spaces, and our axiomatic presentation allows for various realizations.</description>

      <title>Relaxations of KKT Conditions do not Strengthen Finite RLT and SDP-RLT Bounds for Nonconvex Quadratic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear and semidefinite programming relaxations of nonconvex quadratic programs given by the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT relaxation), and the Shor relaxation combined with the RLT relaxation (SDP-RLT relaxation). By incorporating the first-order optimality conditions, a quadratic program can be formulated as an optimization problem with complementarity constraints. We investigate the effect of incorporating optimality conditions on the strength of the RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations. Under the assumption that the original relaxations have a finite optimal value, we establish that the RLT and SDP-RLT bounds arising from the complementarity formulation agree with their counterparts. We present several classes of instances of quadratic programs with unbounded RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations to illustrate the different behavior of the relaxations of the complementarity formulation. In particular, our examples reveal that relaxations of optimality conditions may even yield misleading information on certain families of instances.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Programming Model for Dynamic Stochastic Matching and Its Application on Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Important pricing problems in centralized matching markets -- such as carpooling and food delivery platforms -- often exhibit a bi-level structure. At the upper level, the platform sets prices for different types of agents (e.g., riders with various origins and destinations, or delivery orders from diverse restaurants to customer locations). The lower level then matches converted agents to minimize operational costs, such as pooling riders with similar itineraries into the same vehicle or consolidating multiple delivery orders into a single trip. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal value (cost) function of a linear programming model with respect to agent arrival rates, originally proposed by Aouad and Saritac (2022) for cost-minimizing dynamic stochastic matching under limited time. In particular, we investigate the concavity of this cost function. We show that weak concavity holds when there are fewer than or equal to three agent types with identical patience level. For an arbitrary number of agent types, (weak) concavity is more likely to hold when agents have high or similar patience, or when agents are more heterogeneous in their matching efficiencies. Building on these theoretical insights, we develop a Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm for the pricing problem that requires little stepsize tuning, and demonstrate substantial performance improvements over projected gradient-based methods on a large-scale, real-world ridesharing dataset. This makes it a compelling algorithmic choice for solving such pricing problems in practice.</description>

      <title>A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Optimal Design of Parking Lots with One-way and Two-way Lanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of maximizing the number of stalls in parking lots where vehicles park perpendicular to the driveways. Building on recent research, we first formulate a mixed integer program to maximize the number of parking stalls using a flow-based approach. Parking lots are rasterized into a grid, and the proposed MIP model optimizes them in a generic manner, adapting to the grid resolution and stall size without the need for custom formulations. The constraints ensure the connectivity of parking stalls and driveways to the entrance/exit. This formulation is then extended to the case of one-way driving lanes. We also propose valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm for the one-way and two-way lane configurations. This approach eliminates flow variables, big-M type constraints, and improves solution times for medium-sized instances. The effectiveness of the suggested models is showcased on 325 parking lots in New York City. For instances in which the flow version could be solved in 15 minutes, the branch-and-cut algorithm improved the median runtimes by 87.43% for the one-way case and by 79.36% for the two-way case and resulted in better optimality gaps for the other instances, compared to the baseline flow-based formulation. Similar advantages were observed when run with a time budget of two hours. One-way configurations accommodated up to 18.63% more vehicles on average than their two-way counterparts across all the instances. Modifications to the proposed formulations that consider the turning characteristics of vehicles and the presence of multiple entrances and exits are also examined.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general framework that guarantees the preservation of optimal control patterns as the time horizon $[0,T]$ increases and becomes unbounded. A concept of pattern-preserving family of optimal control problems is introduced and the goal is achieved by analyzing the $\Gamma$-convergence of the corresponding variational formulations as $T\to\infty$. Special attention is given to scenarios involving state constraints. To illustrate the results, examples and applications are provided, with particular focus on switched systems and epidemic control.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Regulation: Gaussian Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear systems using a data-driven approach. An output feedback controller is proposed that integrates a traditional control component with a data-driven learning algorithm based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression to learn the nonlinear internal model. Specifically, a data-driven technique is employed to directly approximate the unknown internal model steady-state map from observed input-output data online. Our method does not rely on model-based observers utilized in previous studies, making it robust and suitable for systems with modelling errors and model uncertainties. Finally, we demonstrate through numerical examples and detailed stability analysis that, under suitable conditions, the closed-loop system remains bounded and converges to a compact set, with the size of this set decreasing as the accuracy of the data-driven model improves over time.</description>

      <title>Subspace-constrained randomized coordinate descent for linear systems with good low-rank matrix approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The randomized coordinate descent (RCD) method is a classical algorithm with simple, lightweight iterations that is widely used for various optimization problems, including the solution of positive semidefinite linear systems. As a linear solver, RCD is particularly effective when the matrix is well-conditioned; however, its convergence rate deteriorates rapidly in the presence of large spectral outliers. In this paper, we introduce the subspace-constrained randomized coordinate descent (SC-RCD) method, in which the dynamics of RCD are restricted to an affine subspace corresponding to a column Nystr\"{o}m approximation, efficiently computed using the recently analyzed RPCholesky algorithm. We prove that SC-RCD converges at a rate that is unaffected by large spectral outliers, making it an effective and memory-efficient solver for large-scale, dense linear systems with rapidly decaying spectra, such as those encountered in kernel ridge regression. Experimental validation and comparisons with related solvers based on coordinate descent and the conjugate gradient method demonstrate the efficiency of SC-RCD. Our theoretical results are derived by developing a more general subspace-constrained framework for the sketch-and-project method. This framework generalizes popular algorithms such as randomized Kaczmarz and coordinate descent, and provides a flexible, implicit preconditioning strategy for a variety of iterative solvers, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Probability-One Optimization of Generalized Rayleigh Quotient Sum For Multi-Source Generalized Total Least-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the global optimization of the sum of the Rayleigh quotient and the generalized Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere. While various methods have been proposed for this problem, they do not guarantee convergence to the global maximizer. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a probability-one homotopy optimization method that, under certain conditions, guarantees convergence to the global maximizer. The proposed method is analyzed alongside state-of-the-art approaches through numerical experiments, evaluating their performance in terms of convergence speed and ability to reach the global maximizer. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this ties in with the multi-source Bayesian Generalized Total Least-Squares (B-GTLS) problem, illustrating its applicability.</description>

      <title>Tractable hierarchies of convex relaxations for polynomial optimization on the nonnegative orthant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider polynomial optimization problems (POP) on a semialgebraic set contained in the nonnegative orthant (every POP on a compact set can be put in this format by a simple translation of the origin). Such a POP can be converted to an equivalent POP by squaring each variable. Using even symmetry and the concept of factor width, we propose a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations based on the extension of P\'olya's Positivstellensatz by Dickinson-Povh. As its distinguishing and crucial feature, the maximal matrix size of each resulting semidefinite relaxation can be chosen arbitrarily and in addition, we prove that the sequence of values returned by the new hierarchy converges to the optimal value of the original POP at the rate $O(\varepsilon^{-c})$ if the semialgebraic set has nonempty interior. When applied to (i) robustness certification of multi-layer neural networks and (ii) computation of positive maximal singular values, our method based on P\'olya's Positivstellensatz provides better bounds and runs several hundred times faster than the standard Moment-SOS hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Randomized Block-Coordinate Optimistic Gradient Algorithms for Root-Finding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03113v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop two new randomized block-coordinate optimistic gradient algorithms to approximate a solution of nonlinear equations in large-scale settings, which are called root-finding problems. Our first algorithm is non-accelerated with constant stepsizes, and achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ best-iterate convergence rate on $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert Gx^k\Vert^2]$ when the underlying operator $G$ is Lipschitz continuous and satisfies a weak Minty solution condition, where $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ is the expectation and $k$ is the iteration counter. Our second method is a new accelerated randomized block-coordinate optimistic gradient algorithm. We establish both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ last-iterate convergence rates on both $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert Gx^k\Vert^2]$ and $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert x^{k+1} - x^{k}\Vert^2]$ for this algorithm under the co-coerciveness of $G$. In addition, we prove that the iterate sequence $\{x^k\}$ converges to a solution almost surely, and $k\Vert Gx^k\Vert$ attains a $o(1/k)$ almost sure convergence rate. Then, we apply our methods to a class of large-scale finite-sum inclusions, which covers prominent applications in machine learning, statistical learning, and network optimization, especially in federated learning. We obtain two new federated learning-type algorithms and their convergence rate guarantees for solving this problem class.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Delayed Flexibility: Balls, Bins, and a Few Opaque Promotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective load balancing lies at the heart of many applications in operations. Frequently tackled via the balls-into-bins paradigm, seminal results established the power of two choices in load balancing: a limited amount of costly flexibility goes a long way in order to maintain an approximately balanced load throughout the decision-making horizon. In many applications, however, balance across time may be too stringent a requirement; rather, the only desideratum is approximate balance at the {\it end} of the horizon. Motivated by this observation, in this work we design "delayed-flexibility" algorithms tailored to such settings. For the canonical balls-into-bins problem, we show that a simple policy that begins exerting flexibility toward the end of the time horizon - namely, when $\Theta\left(\sqrt{T\log T}\right)$ periods remain - suffices to achieve an approximately balanced load, i.e., a maximum load within $O(1)$ of the average load. Moreover, with just a small amount of adaptivity, a threshold policy achieves the same result, while only exerting flexibility in $O\left(\sqrt{T}\right)$ periods, thus matching a natural lower bound. We leverage these results to study the design of opaque selling strategies in retail settings, a topic recently identified as a key application of the power of two choices paradigm. For this problem, we prove that late-stage opaque selling strategies achieve the optimal trade-off between exerting costly flexibility - i.e., offering the opaque product at a discount - and achieving inventory cost savings through load balancing. We demonstrate the robustness of our insights via extensive numerical experiments, for a variety of customer choice models.</description>

Abstract: We use the geometry of suitably generalised potentials to solve risk-sensitive Markovian optimal stopping problems. As in the linear case due to Dynkin and Yushkievich (1967), the value function is the pointwise infimum of those functions which dominate the gain function. An emphasis is placed on geometric and pathwise arguments, rather than exploiting convexity, positive homogeneity or related analytical properties. An algorithm is provided to construct the value function at the computational cost of a two-dimensional search.</description>

      <title>A Double Decomposition Algorithm for Network Planning and Operations in Deviated Fixed-route Microtransit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microtransit offers opportunities to enhance urban mobility by combining the reliability of public transit and the flexibility of ride-sharing. This paper optimizes the design and operations of a deviated fixed-route microtransit system that relies on reference lines but can deviate on demand in response to passenger requests. We formulate a Microtransit Network Design (MiND) model via two-stage stochastic integer optimization, with a first-stage network design and service scheduling structure and a second-stage vehicle routing structure. We derive a tight second-stage relaxation using a subpath-based representation of microtransit operations in a load-expanded network. We develop a double-decomposition algorithm combining Benders decomposition and subpath-based column generation. We prove that the algorithm maintains a valid optimality gap and converges to an optimal solution in a finite number of iterations. Results obtained with real-world data from Manhattan show that the methodology scales to large and otherwise-intractable instances, with up to 10-100 candidate lines and hundreds of stops. Comparisons with transit and ride-sharing suggest that microtransit can provide win-win outcomes toward efficient mobility (high demand coverage, low costs, high level of service), equitable mobility (broad geographic reach) and sustainable mobility (limited environmental footprint). We provide an open-source implementation to enable replication.</description>

      <title>Social Optimum of a Linear Quadratic Collective Choice Model under Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the social optimum for a dynamic linear quadratic collective choice problem where a group of agents choose among multiple alternatives or destinations. The agents' common objective is to minimize the average cost of the entire population. A naive approach to finding a social optimum for this problem involves solving a number of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems that increases exponentially with the population size. By exploiting the problem's symmetries, we first show that one can equivalently solve a number of LQR problems equal to the number of destinations, followed by an optimal transport problem parameterized by the fraction of agents choosing each destination. Then, we further reduce the complexity of the solution search by defining an appropriate system of limiting equations, whose solution is used to obtain a strategy shown to be asymptotically optimal as the number of agents becomes large. The model includes a congestion effect captured by a negative quadratic term in the social cost function, which may cause agents to escape to infinity in finite time. Hence, we identify sufficient conditions, independent of the population size, for the existence of the social optimum. Lastly, we investigate the behavior of the model through numerical simulations in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Six-Degree-of-Freedom Aircraft Landing Trajectory Planning with Runway Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical optimization algorithm for generating approach and landing trajectories for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) aircraft. We improve on the existing research on aircraft landing trajectory generation by formulating the trajectory optimization problem with additional real-world operational constraints, including 6-DoF aircraft dynamics, runway alignment, constant wind field, and obstacle avoidance, to obtain a continuous-time nonconvex optimal control problem. Particularly, the runway alignment constraint enforces the trajectory of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway only during the final approach phase. This is a novel feature that is essential for preventing an approach that is either too steep or too shallow. The proposed method models the runway alignment constraint through a multi-phase trajectory planning scheme, imposing alignment conditions exclusively during the final approach phase. We compare this formulation with the existing state-triggered constraint formulation for runway alignment. To solve the formulated problem, we design a novel sequential convex programming algorithm called xPTR that extends the penalized trust-region (PTR) algorithm by incorporating an extrapolation step to expedite convergence. We validate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations, including a Monte Carlo study, to evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to varying initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Distributionally and Adversarially Robust Logistic Regression via Intersecting Wasserstein Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13625v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarially robust optimization (ARO) has emerged as the *de facto* standard for training models that hedge against adversarial attacks in the test stage. While these models are robust against adversarial attacks, they tend to suffer severely from overfitting. To address this issue, some successful methods replace the empirical distribution in the training stage with alternatives including *(i)* a worst-case distribution residing in an ambiguity set, resulting in a distributionally robust (DR) counterpart of ARO; *(ii)* a mixture of the empirical distribution with a distribution induced by an auxiliary (*e.g.*, synthetic, external, out-of-domain) dataset. Inspired by the former, we study the Wasserstein DR counterpart of ARO for logistic regression and show it admits a tractable convex optimization reformulation. Adopting the latter setting, we revise the DR approach by intersecting its ambiguity set with another ambiguity set built using the auxiliary dataset, which offers a significant improvement whenever the Wasserstein distance between the data generating and auxiliary distributions can be estimated. We study the underlying optimization problem, develop efficient solution algorithms, and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark approaches on standard datasets.</description>

      <title>Convergence Conditions for Stochastic Line Search Based Optimization of Over-parametrized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with algorithms to solve the finite-sum problems related to fitting over-parametrized models, that typically satisfy the interpolation condition. In particular, we focus on approaches based on stochastic line searches and employing general search directions. We define conditions on the sequence of search directions that guarantee finite termination and bounds for the backtracking procedure. Moreover, we shed light on the additional property of directions needed to prove fast (linear) convergence of the general class of algorithms when applied to PL functions in the interpolation regime. From the point of view of algorithms design, the proposed analysis identifies safeguarding conditions that could be employed in relevant algorithmic frameworks.

      <title>Unified Breakdown Analysis for Byzantine Robust Gossip</title>

Abstract: In decentralized machine learning, different devices communicate in a peer-to-peer manner to collaboratively learn from each other's data. Such approaches are vulnerable to misbehaving (or Byzantine) devices. We introduce F-RG, a general framework for building robust decentralized algorithms with guarantees arising from robust-sum-like aggregation rules F. We then investigate the notion of *breakdown point*, and show an upper bound on the number of adversaries that decentralized algorithms can tolerate. We introduce a practical robust aggregation rule, coined CS+, such that CS+-RG has a near-optimal breakdown. Other choices of aggregation rules lead to existing algorithms such as ClippedGossip or NNA. We give experimental evidence to validate the effectiveness of CS+-RG and highlight the gap with NNA, in particular against a novel attack tailored to decentralized communications.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-play superiorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superiorization methodology (SM) is an optimization heuristic in which an iterative algorithm, which aims to solve a particular problem, is ``superiorized'' to promote solutions that are improved with respect to some secondary criterion. This superiorization is achieved by perturbing iterates of the algorithm in nonascending directions of a prescribed function that penalizes undesirable characteristics in the solution; the solution produced by the superiorized algorithm should therefore be improved with respect to the value of this function. In this paper, we broaden the SM to allow for the perturbations to be introduced by an arbitrary procedure instead, using a plug-and-play approach. This allows for operations such as image denoisers or deep neural networks, which have applications to a broad class of problems, to be incorporated within the superiorization methodology. As proof of concept, we perform numerical simulations involving low-dose and sparse-view computed tomography image reconstruction, comparing the plug-and-play approach to two conventionally superiorized algorithms, as well as a post-processing approach. The plug-and-play approach provides comparable or better image quality in most cases, while also providing advantages in terms of computing time, and data fidelity of the solutions.</description>

      <title>ROS: A GNN-based Relax-Optimize-and-Sample Framework for Max-k-Cut Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Max-k-Cut problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge that generalizes the classic NP-complete Max-Cut problem. While relaxation techniques are commonly employed to tackle Max-k-Cut, they often lack guarantees of equivalence between the solutions of the original problem and its relaxation. To address this issue, we introduce the Relax-Optimize-and-Sample (ROS) framework. In particular, we begin by relaxing the discrete constraints to the continuous probability simplex form. Next, we pre-train and fine-tune a graph neural network model to efficiently optimize the relaxed problem. Subsequently, we propose a sampling-based construction algorithm to map the continuous solution back to a high-quality Max-k-Cut solution. By integrating geometric landscape analysis with statistical theory, we establish the consistency of function values between the continuous solution and its mapped counterpart. Extensive experimental results on random regular graphs and the Gset benchmark demonstrate that the proposed ROS framework effectively scales to large instances with up to 20000 nodes in just a few seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, ROS exhibits strong generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances, underscoring its effectiveness for large-scale optimization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trust-region algorithms can be applied to very abstract optimization problems because they do not require a specific direction of descent or gradient. This has lead to recent interest in them, in particular in the area of integer optimal control problems, where the infinite-dimensional problem formulations do not assume vector space structure.
  We analyze a trust-region algorithm in the abstract setting of a metric space, a setting in which integer optimal control problems with total variation regularization can be formulated. Our analysis avoids a reset of the trust-region radius upon acceptance of the iterates when proving convergence to stationary points. This reset has been present in previous analyses of trust-region algorithms for integer optimal control problems. Our computational benchmark shows that the runtime can be considerably improved when avoiding this reset, which is now theoretically justified.</description>

      <title>The randomization method in stochastic optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we make a survey on the so called randomization method, a recent methodology to study stochastic optimization problems. It allows to represent the value function of an optimal control problem by a suitable backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), by means of an auxiliary optimization problem having the same value as the starting one. This method works for a large class of control problems and provides a BSDE representation to many related PDEs of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type, even in the fully non linear case. After a general informal introduction we explain the method giving full details in a basic case. Then we try to give a complete picture of the existing applications and we present some related open problems.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Water Treatment through Fractional-Order Chemostat Modeling with Sliding Memory and Periodic Boundary Conditions: A Mathematical Framework for Clean Water and Sanitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the theoretical properties of a fractional-order chemostat system with sliding memory and periodic boundary conditions, used to model the cultivation of microorganisms for pollutant degradation. By incorporating Caputo fractional derivatives with a sliding memory window (CFDS), the model captures time-dependent behaviors and memory effects in biological systems more effectively than integer-order derivatives. We reduce the two-dimensional fractional differential equations (FDEs) governing substrate and biomass concentrations to a one-dimensional FDE, utilizing periodic boundary conditions. The existence and uniqueness of non-constant periodic solutions are established using the Carath\'eodory framework and fixed-point theorems, ensuring the system's well-posedness. We prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, demonstrating that substrate concentrations remain within physically meaningful bounds and biomass concentrations stay strictly positive, with solution trajectories confined to a biologically feasible invariant set. Additionally, we analyze non-trivial equilibria under constant dilution rates and derive their stability properties. The results validate the mathematical robustness of the fractional-order chemostat model for periodic bioprocesses, offering a foundation for advanced water treatment technologies and sanitation improvements.</description>

      <title>Optimization over Sparse Support-Preserving Sets: Two-Step Projection with Global Optimality Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In sparse optimization, enforcing hard constraints using the $\ell_0$ pseudo-norm offers advantages like controlled sparsity compared to convex relaxations. However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity constraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been developed to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex constraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed constraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of convergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in sparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of sparse optimization with extra support-preserving constraints commonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative hard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection operator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple alternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By introducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality, we provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our algorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under the conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a fundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of the classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection operator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an elegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the zeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art result from de Vazelhes et. al. (2022), even in the case without additional constraints, by allowing us to remove a non-vanishing system error present in their work.</description>

      <title>Generating Likely Counterfactuals Using Sum-Product Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14086v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need to explain decisions made by AI systems is driven by both recent regulation and user demand. The decisions are often explainable only post hoc. In counterfactual explanations, one may ask what constitutes the best counterfactual explanation. Clearly, multiple criteria must be taken into account, although "distance from the sample" is a key criterion. Recent methods that consider the plausibility of a counterfactual seem to sacrifice this original objective. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood explanations that are, at the same time, close and sparse. We show that the search for the most likely explanations satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be modeled using Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO). We use a Sum-Product Network (SPN) to estimate the likelihood of a counterfactual. To achieve that, we propose an MIO formulation of an SPN, which can be of independent interest.

      <title>Scalable First-order Method for Certifying Optimal k-Sparse GLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of certifying optimality for sparse generalized linear models (GLMs), where sparsity is enforced through an $\ell_0$ cardinality constraint. While branch-and-bound (BnB) frameworks can certify optimality by pruning nodes using dual bounds, existing methods for computing these bounds are either computationally intensive or exhibit slow convergence, limiting their scalability to large-scale problems. To address this challenge, we propose a first-order proximal gradient algorithm designed to solve the perspective relaxation of the problem within a BnB framework. Specifically, we formulate the relaxed problem as a composite optimization problem and demonstrate that the proximal operator of the non-smooth component can be computed exactly in log-linear time complexity, eliminating the need to solve a computationally expensive second-order cone program. Furthermore, we introduce a simple restart strategy that enhances convergence speed while maintaining low per-iteration complexity. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly accelerates dual bound computations and is highly effective in providing optimality certificates for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Utility Maximization Under Endogenous Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a general existence result for expected utility maximization in settings where the agent's decision affects the uncertainty faced by her. We introduce a continuity condition for choice-dependent probability measures which ensures the upper semi-continuity of expected utility. Our topological proof imposes minimal restrictions on the utility function and the random variable. In particular, we do not need common assumptions like the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP) or the convexity of distribution functions condition (CDFC). Additionally, we identify sufficient conditions - continuity of densities and stochastic dominance - which help verify our assumptions in most practical applications. These findings expand the applicability of expected utility theory in settings with endogenous uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Failure of the measure contraction property via quotients in higher-step sub-Riemannian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the synthetic Ricci curvature lower bound known as the measure contraction property (MCP) can fail in sub-Riemannian geometry. This may happen beyond step two, if the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, and it already occurs in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.
  Central to our analysis are new results, of independent interest, on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.
  As an application, we find sub-Riemannian structures with pre-medium-fat distribution that do not satisfy the MCP, answering a question raised in [L. Rifford, J. \'Ec. polytech. Math. 2023]. Finally, and quite unexpectedly, we show that ideal sub-Riemannian structures can fail the MCP, and this actually happens generically for rank greater than 3 and high dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We first propose an alternative definition of quasi-reversibility that encompasses reversibility and highlights the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that supplementing a quasi-reversible queueing system with a balanced arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Coordinate Momentum in SignSGD and Muon: Memory-Optimized Zero-Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose $\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for resource-constrained LLM adaptation.

      <title>Modified K-means Algorithm with Local Optimality Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The K-means algorithm is one of the most widely studied clustering algorithms in machine learning. While extensive research has focused on its ability to achieve a globally optimal solution, there still lacks a rigorous analysis of its local optimality guarantees. In this paper, we first present conditions under which the K-means algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution. Based on this, we propose simple modifications to the K-means algorithm which ensure local optimality in both the continuous and discrete sense, with the same computational complexity as the original K-means algorithm. As the dissimilarity measure, we consider a general Bregman divergence, which is an extension of the squared Euclidean distance often used in the K-means algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm does not always find a locally optimal solution in practice, while our proposed methods provide improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/lmingyi/LO-K-means.</description>
