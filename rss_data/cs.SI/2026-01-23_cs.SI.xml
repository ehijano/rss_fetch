      <title>MLP-Enhanced Nonnegative Tensor RESCAL Decomposition for Dynamic Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic community detection plays a crucial role in understanding the temporal evolution of community structures in complex networks. Existing methods based on nonnegative tensor RESCAL decomposition typically require the decomposition rank to equal the number of communities, which limits model flexibility. This paper proposes an improved MLP-enhanced nonnegative tensor decomposition model (MLP-NTD) that incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) after RESCAL decomposition for community mapping, thereby decoupling the decomposition rank from the number of communities. The framework optimizes model parameters through a reconstruction loss function, which preserves the ability to capture dynamic community evolution while significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of community partitioning. Experimental results on multiple real-world dynamic network datasets demonstrate that MLP-NTD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of modularity, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Mapping Social Media User Behaviors in Reciprocity Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media users exhibit diverse behavioral patterns as platforms function simultaneously as information and friendship networks. We introduce a reciprocity-based framework mapping users onto two-dimensional space defined by bidirectional connection ratios. Analyzing 48,830 Twitter users and 149 million connections, we demonstrate that fragmented user types from prior studies (influencers, lurkers, brokers, and follow-back accounts) emerge naturally as regions within continuous behavioral space rather than discrete categories. User properties vary smoothly across the reciprocity dimensions, revealing clear behavioral gradients. This framework provides the first unified model encompassing the full spectrum of social media behaviors and offers interpretable metrics for influence measurement and platform design.</description>

      <title>Community-Size Biases in Statistical Inference of Communities in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of time-dependent (i.e., temporal) networks, researchers often examine the evolution of communities, which are sets of densely connected sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other nodes. An increasingly prominent approach to studying community structure in temporal networks is statistical inference. In the present paper, we study the performance of a class of statistical-inference methods for community detection in temporal networks. We represent temporal networks as multilayer networks, with each layer encoding a time step, and we illustrate that statistical-inference models that generate community assignments via either a uniform distribution on community assignments or discrete-time Markov processes are biased against generating communities with large or small numbers of nodes. In particular, we demonstrate that statistical-inference methods that use such generative models tend to poorly identify community structure in networks with large or small communities. To rectify this issue, we introduce a novel statistical model that generates the community assignments of the nodes in given layer (i.e., at a given time) using all of the community assignments in the previous layer. We prove results that guarantee that our approach greatly mitigates the bias against large and small communities, so using our generative model is beneficial for studying community structure in networks with large or small communities.

      <title>Impression Zombies: Characteristics Analysis and Classification of New Harmful Accounts on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Impression Zombies'', a type of malicious account designed to artificially inflate engagement metrics, have recently emerged as a significant threat on X (formerly Twitter). These accounts disseminate a high volume of low-quality, irrelevant posts, which degrade the user experience. This study aims (1) to quantitatively characterize their behavioral patterns and (2) to develop a method for detecting such accounts. To address the first objective, we collected data from 9,909 accounts and compared the characteristics of Impression Zombies and general users within this dataset. We find that, Impression Zombies post more than three times the average total number of posts per day and tend to gather followers by using phrases such as ``follow back.'' Addressing the second objective, we constructed a classification model for Impression Zombies that leverages the contextual incoherence often observed between parent posts and the replies from Impression Zombies. Experimental results show that our model achieved approximately 92\% accuracy in detecting Impression Zombies. This study provides the first quantitative insights into Impression Zombies and offers a practical framework for detecting such accounts, contributing to platform transparency and the health of social media ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Profit Maximization for Viral Marketing in Online Social Networks using Two Phase Diffusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Now-a-days, Online Social Networks (OSNs) are extensively used by different commercial houses for viral marketing. The key problem that arises in this context is to choose a limited number of highly influential users as the initial adopters of a brand such that the influence regarding the brand in the network gets maximized. Deviating from this standard setting, in this paper, we study the problem where every user of the network is associated with a selection cost and a benefit value. This benefit value can be earned from the user if (s)he is influenced by the brand. A fixed amount of budget is allocated for selecting the seed users. The goal of initial adopters is to choose a set of seed users within the budget such that the profit is maximized. We propose a two phase diffusion model for this problem where the goal is to split the diffusion process into two phases, and hence, split the budget into two halves. First, we spend the first half budget to select seed users for the first phase and observe the diffusion for a few rounds and then deploy the seed users for the second phase and successively complete the diffusion process. We prove several properties of the two phase influence function. Three solution approaches have been proposed for our problem with detailed analysis and illustrative examples. We conduct a number of experiments with three real-world social network datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the two phase diffusion approach leads to more amount of profit compared to the single-phase diffusion. In particular, for most instances, this improvement is greater than 18% and reaching as high as 40% by the proposed methodologies.</description>

      <title>Can Platform Design Encourage Curiosity? Evidence from an Independent Social Media Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms are often criticized for fostering antisocial behavior rather than prosocial behavior. Yet, testing interventions to encourage prosocial dispositions, such as open-mindedness, has been hindered by researchers' limited ability to manipulate platform features and isolate causal effects in commercial environments. We address this challenge through a randomized controlled trial with 2,282 U.S. adults conducted on a new research platform we developed that uses AI bots to replicate live social media dynamics while enabling controlled experimentation. Participants engaged in 15-minute discussions about energy and climate topics, with treatment groups exposed to curiosity priming either through modified on-platform social norms, interface affordances, or both. Results demonstrate that curiosity priming significantly increased question-asking behavior and textual measures of curiosity in user posts, while also reducing toxicity. Although interventions decreased generic engagement behaviors like liking and commenting, they had no significant negative impact on reported app enjoyment or time spent writing posts and replies. Leveraging experimental control over platform features, our findings suggest that platform designs prioritizing curiosity can promote prosocial behaviors among users without compromising user experience.</description>

      <title>ToxiTwitch: Toward Emote-Aware Hybrid Moderation for Live Streaming Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of live-streaming platforms such as Twitch has introduced complex challenges in moderating toxic behavior. Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent). This work is an exploratory study intended to surface challenges and limits of emote-aware toxicity detection on Twitch.</description>

      <title>Predicting Healthcare System Visitation Flow by Integrating Hospital Attributes and Population Socioeconomics with Human Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.</description>

      <title>Strategic forecasting of internet of things technologies through patent social network and innovation cluster analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies necessitates robust forecasting mechanisms to guide strategic decision-making amid increasingly complex innovation landscapes. Despite extensive research employing patent analysis for technology forecasting, existing studies lack systematic integration of social network analysis, advanced text mining, and life cycle modeling to comprehensively map IoT technological evolution and collaborative dynamics. This study addresses these gaps by analyzing 154,227 IoT-related patents through a unified methodological framework combining BERT-based text embeddings, k-means clustering with Davies-Bouldin optimization, S-curve life cycle modeling, and Louvain community detection. The analysis identified nine distinct technology clusters spanning foundational infrastructure (Smart Monitoring and Sensor Systems, Network Communication and Data Transmission) to domain-specific applications (Agricultural IoT, Connected Vehicle Technologies). Life cycle assessment revealed temporal convergence, with eight clusters reaching saturation between 2023 and 2027, reflecting ecosystem-wide synchronization driven by standardization imperatives, platform consolidation, and pandemic-accelerated digital transformation. Social network analysis uncovered five major collaborative communities exhibiting divergent strategic orientations: from extreme specialization (Global Telecommunications Technology Leaders: 87.7% network communication focus) to diversified portfolios (China State Grid IoT Consortium: balanced infrastructure investment). Cross-analysis revealed complementary innovation strategies where infrastructure operators pursue breadth, telecommunications specialists maintain focused expertise, and academic researchers emphasize development-aligned agendas.</description>

      <title>Cohesive Group Discovery in Interaction Graphs under Explicit Density Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering cohesive groups is a fundamental primitive in graph-based recommender systems, underpinning tasks such as social recommendation, bundle discovery, and community-aware modeling. In interaction graphs, cohesion is often modeled as the $\gamma$-quasi-clique, an induced subgraph whose internal edge density meets a user-defined threshold $\gamma$. This formulation provides explicit control over within-group connectivity while accommodating the sparsity inherent in real-world data. This paper presents EDQC, an effective framework for cohesive group discovery under explicit density constraints. EDQC leverages a lightweight energy diffusion process to rank vertices for localizing promising candidate regions. Guided by this ranking, the framework extracts and refines a candidate subgraph to ensure the output strictly satisfies the target density requirement. Extensive experiments on 75 real-world graphs across varying density thresholds demonstrate that EDQC identifies the largest mean $\gamma$-quasi-cliques in the vast majority of cases, achieving lower variance than the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive runtime. Furthermore, statistical analysis confirms that EDQC significantly outperforms the baselines, underscoring its robustness and practical utility for cohesive group discovery in graph-based recommender systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing importance of the digital sector, research on economic complexity and its implications continues to rely mostly on administrative records, e.g. data on exports, patents, and employment, that have blind spots when it comes to the digital economy. In this paper we use data on the geography of programming languages used in open-source software to extend economic complexity ideas to the digital economy. We estimate a country's software economic complexity index (ECIsoftware) and show that it complements the ability of measures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research to account for international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and emissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of relatedness, meaning that a country's entries and exits in programming languages are partly explained by its current pattern of specialization. Together, these findings help extend economic complexity ideas and their policy implications to the digital economy.</description>

      <title>A large-scale evaluation of commonsense knowledge in humans and large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commonsense knowledge, a major constituent of artificial intelligence (AI), is primarily evaluated in practice by human-prescribed ground-truth labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a method for assessing commonsense knowledge in AI, specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense knowledge to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Structural Disparities in the Web of Scientific Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific attention is unevenly distributed, creating inequities in recognition and distorting access to opportunities. Using citations as a proxy, we quantify disparities in attention by gender and institutional prestige. We find that women receive systematically fewer citations than men, and that attention is increasingly concentrated among authors from elite institutions -- patterns not fully explained by underrepresentation alone. To explain these dynamics, we introduce a model of citation network growth that incorporates homophily (tendency to cite similar authors), preferential attachment (favoring highly cited authors) and group size (underrepresentation). The model shows that disparities arise not only from group size imbalances but also from cumulative advantage amplifying biased citation preferences. Importantly, increasing representation alone is often insufficient to reduce disparities. Effective strategies should also include reducing homophily, amplifying the visibility of underrepresented groups, and supporting equitable integration of newcomers. Our findings highlight the challenges of mitigating inequities in asymmetric networks like citations, where recognition flows in one direction. By making visible the mechanisms through which attention is distributed, we contribute to efforts toward a more responsible web of science that is fairer, more transparent, and more inclusive, and that better sustains innovation and knowledge production.</description>
