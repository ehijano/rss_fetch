      <title>Real-Time Doppler and Ionospheric Dispersion Correction Techniques for Arbitrary Waveforms Utilizing GPU Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems, real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion. Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.</description>

      <title>Anti-Jamming Sensing with Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs) are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns, RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation. Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance even under jamming attack.</description>

      <title>Localized Kernel Methods for Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT, which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples than other methods.
  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator (SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.
  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and signal classification using extracted features.</description>

      <title>Power-Constrained and Quantized MIMO-RSMA Systems with Imperfect CSIT: Joint Precoding, Antenna Selection, and Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS), we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Channel-Aided CSI Prediction: A Environment-based Subspace Extraction Approach for Achieving Low Overhead and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios, sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC) techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP) for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Liquid Lens-based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced, leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses, liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times 10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Dynamic Environment Reconstruction for Vehicular ISAC Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals, thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.</description>

      <title>Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses. Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for the various analyses.</description>

      <title>Sub- {\mu} W Battery-Less and Oscillator-Less Wi-Fi Backscattering Transmitter Reusing RF Signal for Harvesting, Communications, and Motion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting, backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS), allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s) shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>0.6-V, uW-Power 4-Stage OTA with Minimal Components and 100X Load Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives, overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the &gt;3.7X (&gt;11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads (double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load capacitance of &gt;100X.</description>

      <title>Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.</description>

      <title>Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However, advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance. Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system. 3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance, indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements, and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond 64-QAM.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Optimization for Movable Antenna-Aided Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable antenna (MA) systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption introduced by MA movement. We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency for a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped with a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.</description>

      <title>Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>TeraRIS NOMA-MIMO Communications for 6G and Beyond Industrial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with Terahertz (THz) communications and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future 6G networks and beyond. Within this framework, two power allocation strategies are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial communications.</description>

      <title>Joint parameter estimation and multidimensional reconciliation for CV-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.</description>

      <title>Latency Minimization for Multi-AAV-Enabled ISCC Systems with Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of degrees of freedom (NDoF) in a communication channel fundamentally limits the number of independent spatial modes available for transmitting and receiving information. Although the NDoF can be computed numerically for specific configurations using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel operator, this approach provides limited physical insight. In this paper, we introduce a simple analytical estimate for the NDoF between arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions in free space. In the electrically large limit, where the NDoF is high, it is well approximated by the mutual shadow area, measured in units of wavelength squared. This area corresponds to the projected overlap of the regions, integrated over all lines of sight, and captures their effective spatial coupling. The proposed estimate generalizes and unifies several previously established results, including those based on Weyl's law, shadow area, and the paraxial approximation. We analyze several example configurations to illustrate the accuracy of the estimate and validate it through comparisons with numerical SVD computations of the propagation channel. The results provide both practical tools and physical insight for the design and analysis of high-capacity communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Online Graph Topology Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. While recent advances have enabled graph topology learning from observed signals, existing methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. To address this gap, we introduce AdaCGP, a sparsity-aware adaptive algorithm for dynamic graph topology estimation from multivariate time series. AdaCGP estimates the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance, and bias. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that AdaCGP consistently outperforms multiple baselines across diverse graph topologies, achieving improvements exceeding 83% in GSO estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining favourable computational scaling properties. Our variable splitting approach enables reliable identification of causal connections with near-zero false alarm rates and minimal missed edges. Applied to cardiac fibrillation recordings, AdaCGP tracks dynamic changes in propagation patterns more effectively than established methods like Granger causality, capturing temporal variations in graph topology that static approaches miss. The algorithm successfully identifies stability characteristics in conduction patterns that may maintain arrhythmias, demonstrating potential for clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment of complex biomedical systems.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation Based Complex-Valued Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem and Its Fast Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a multi-channel self-reset analog-to-digital converter (ADC) system with complex-valued moduli has been proposed. This system enables the recovery of high dynamic range complex-valued bandlimited signals at low sampling rates via the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). In this paper, we investigate complex-valued CRT (C-CRT) with erroneous remainders, where the errors follow wrapped complex Gaussian distributions. Based on the existing real-valued CRT utilizing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we propose a fast MLE-based C-CRT (MLE C-CRT). The proposed algorithm requires only $2L$ searches to obtain the optimal estimate of the common remainder, where $L$ is the number of moduli. Once the common remainder is estimated, the complex number can be determined using the C-CRT. Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the fast MLE C-CRT to achieve robust estimation. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to ADCs. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Optimization of Antenna Switching Schemes for Dynamic Channel Sounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding wireless channels is crucial for the design of wireless systems. For mobile communication, sounders and antenna arrays with short measurement times are required to simultaneously capture the dynamic and spatial channel characteristics. Switched antenna arrays are an attractive option that can overcome the high cost of real arrays and the long measurement times of virtual arrays. Optimization of the switching sequences is then essential to avoid aliasing and increase the accuracy of channel parameter estimates. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive analysis of the design of switching sequences. We first review the conventional spatio-temporal ambiguity function, extend it to dual-polarized antenna arrays, and analyze its prohibitive complexity when applied to ultra-massive antenna arrays. We thus propose a new method that uses the Fisher information matrix to tackle the estimation accuracy. We also propose to minimize the ambiguity by choosing a switching sequence that minimizes side lobes in its Fourier spectrum. In this sense, we divide the sequence design problem into Fourier-based ambiguity reduction and Fisher-based accuracy improvement, and coin the resulting design approach as Fourier-Fisher. Simulations and measurements show that the Fourier-Fisher approach achieves identical performance and significantly lower computational complexity than that of the conventional ambiguity-based approach.</description>

Abstract: We address the channel estimation problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided broadband systems by proposing a dual-structure and multi-dimensional transformations (DS-MDT) algorithm. The proposed approach leverages the dual-structure features of the channel parameters to assist users experiencing weaker channel conditions, thereby enhancing estimation performance. Moreover, given that the channel parameters are distributed across multiple dimensions of the received tensor, the proposed algorithm employs multi-dimensional transformations to effectively isolate and extract distinct parameters. The numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm reduces the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by up to 10 dB while maintaining lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the robust beamforming design for a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided downlink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) communication system, where both transceivers and STAR-RIS suffer from the impact of hardware impairments (HWI).A base station (BS) is deployed to transmit messages concurrently to multiple users, utilizing a STAR-RIS to improve communication quality and expand user coverage. We aim to maximize the achievable sum rate of the users while ensuring the constraints of transmit power, STAR-RIS coefficients, and the actual rate of the common stream for all users. To solve this challenging high-coupling and non-convexity problem, we adopt a fractional programming (FP)-based alternating optimization (AO) approach, where each sub-problem is addressed via successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty function (PF) methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other multiple access schemes and conventional passive RIS in terms of the achievable sum rate. Additionally, considering the HWI of the transceiver and STAR-RIS makes our algorithm more robust than when such considerations are not included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback schemes demonstrate strong compression capabilities but are typically constrained to fixed system configurations, limiting their generalization and flexibility. To address this challenge, WiFo-CF, a novel wireless foundation model tailored for CSI feedback, is proposed, uniquely accommodating heterogeneous configurations such as varying channel dimensions, feedback rates, and data distributions within a unified framework through its key innovations: (1) a multi-user, multi-rate self-supervised pre-training strategy; and (2) a Mixture of Shared and Routed Expert (S-R MoE) architecture. Supporting the large-scale pre-training of WiFo-CF is the first heterogeneous channel feedback dataset, whose diverse patterns enable the model to achieve superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data across simulated and real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the learned representations effectively facilitate adaptation to downstream tasks such as CSI-based indoor localization, validating WiFo-CF's scalability and deployment potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring has become a pivotal tool for diagnosing neurological disorders, particularly for detecting seizures. Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological diseases worldwide, affects approximately the 1 \% of the population. These patients face significant risks, underscoring the need for reliable, continuous seizure monitoring in daily life. Most of the techniques discussed in the literature rely on supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, the challenge of accurately labeling variations in epileptic EEG waveforms complicates the use of these approaches. Additionally, the rarity of ictal events introduces an high imbalancing within the data, which could lead to poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. Instead, a semi-supervised approach allows to train the model only on data not containing seizures, thus avoiding the issues related to the data imbalancing. This work proposes a semi-supervised approach for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data, utilizing a novel Deep Learning-based method called SincVAE. This proposal incorporates the learning of an ad-hoc array of bandpass filter as a first layer of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), potentially eliminating the preprocessing stage where informative band frequencies are identified and isolated. Results indicate that SincVAE improves seizure detection in EEG data and is capable of identifying early seizures during the preictal stage as well as monitoring patients throughout the postictal stage.</description>

      <title>PL-DCP: A Pairwise Learning framework with Domain and Class Prototypes for EEG emotion recognition under unseen target conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals serve as a powerful tool in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCIs) and play a crucial role in affective computing. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning techniques has significantly advanced the development of aBCIs. However, the current emotion recognition methods based on deep transfer learning face the challenge of the dual dependence of the model on source domain and target domain, As well as being affected by label noise, which seriously affects the performance and generalization ability of the model. To overcome this limitation, we proposes a Pairwise Learning framework with Domain and Category Prototypes for EEG emotion recognition under unseen target conditions (PL-DCP), and integrating concepts of feature disentanglement and prototype inference. Here, the feature disentanglement module extracts and decouples the emotional EEG features to form domain features and class features, and further calculates the dual prototype representation. The Domain-pprototype captures the individual variations across subjects, while the class-prototype captures the cross-individual commonality of emotion categories. In addition, the pairwise learning strategy effectively reduces the noise effect caused by wrong labels. The PL-DCP framework conducts a systematic experimental evaluation on the published datasets SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V, and the accuracy are 82.88\%, 65.15\% and 61.29\%, respectively. The results show that compared with other State-of-the-Art(SOTA) Methods, the PL-DCP model still achieves slightly better performance than the deep transfer learning method that requires both source and target data, although the target domain is completely unseen during the training. This work provides an effective and robust potential solution for emotion recognition. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/PL_DCP.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Performance Analysis of Non-Primary Channel Access in Wi-Fi Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve our understanding of the performance of the Non-Primary Channel Access (NPCA) mechanism, a new feature introduced in IEEE 802.11bn to enhance spectrum utilization in Wi-Fi networks. NPCA enables devices to contend for and transmit on the secondary channel when the primary channel is occupied by transmissions from an Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). We develop a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model that captures the interactions among OBSSs in dense Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) environments when NPCA is enabled, incorporating new NPCA-specific states and transitions. In addition to the analytical insights offered by the model, we conduct numerical evaluations and simulations to quantify NPCA's impact on throughput and channel access delay across various scenarios. Our results show that NPCA can significantly improve throughput and reduce access delays in favorable conditions for BSSs that support the mechanism. Moreover, NPCA helps mitigate the OBSS performance anomaly, where low-rate OBSS transmissions degrade network performance for all nearby devices. However, we also observe trade-offs: NPCA may increase contention on secondary channels, potentially reducing transmission opportunities for BSSs operating there. Overall, the proposed modeling approach offers a foundation for analyzing, optimizing, and guiding the development of NPCA in next-generation Wi-Fi networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.</description>

Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.</description>
