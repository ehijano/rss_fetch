      <title>A comparative numerical study of stochastic Hamiltonian Camassa-Holm equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic perturbation of the Camassa-Holm equation such that, unlike previous formulations, energy is conserved by the stochastic flow. We compare this to a complementary approach which preserves Casimirs of the Poisson bracket. Through an energy preserving numerical implementation of the model, we study the influence of noise on the well-known 'peakon' formation behaviour of the solution. The energy conserving stochastic approach generates an ensemble of solutions which are spread around the deterministic Camassa-Holm solution, whereas the Casimir conserving alternative develops peakons which may propagate away from the deterministic solution more dramatically.</description>

      <title>Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Abrupt transitions in the optimization of diffusion with distributed resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian diffusion subject to stochastic resetting to a fixed position has been widely studied for applications to random search processes. In an unbounded domain, the mean first passage time at a target site can be minimized for a convenient choice of the resetting rate. Here we study this optimization problem in one dimension when resetting occurs to random positions, chosen from a distribution with compact support that does not include the target. Depending on the shape of this distribution, the optimal resetting rate either varies smoothly with the mean distance to the target, as in single-site resetting, or exhibits a discontinuity caused by the presence of a second local minimum in the mean first passage time. These two regimes are separated by a critical line containing a singular point that we characterize through a Ginzburg-Landau theory. To quantify how useful a given resetting position is for a search process, we calculate the distribution of the last resetting position before absorption. The discontinuous transition above separates two markedly different optimal strategies: one with a small resetting rate where the last path before absorption starts from a rather distant but likely position, while the other strategy has a large resetting rate, favoring last paths starting from not-so-likely points but which are closer to the target.</description>

      <title>Classical theory of electron-ion correlations at electrochemical interfaces: Closing the circuit from double-layer charging to ion adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric double layer (EDL) that forms at the interface between metals and ionic solutions is at the heart of various energy technologies. Recent experimental data have challenged our traditional understanding of the EDL charging behavior, which is based on mean-field Gouy-Chapman-Stern-type (GCS) models. In this article, we present a classical theory for the EDL, derived from first-principles statistical mechanics, that accounts for electron-ion correlation effects using the method of image charges and systematically extends beyond the mean-field level. Such electron-ion correlations introduce an additional interaction between the metal surface and electrolyte ions, significantly altering the EDL structure. Our theory, valid in the limit of dilute electrolyte solutions and weakly charged metal surfaces, achieves quantitative agreement with experimental capacitance data across a wide range of electrode materials and electrolyte solvents, and thus resolves long-standing questions on the origin of discrepancies to GCS predictions. Thereby, the framework conceptually unifies the processes of double-layer charging and ion adsorption (electrosorption), which are typically considered as distinct phenomena, but are shown to be manifestations of the same fundamental electrostatic principles.</description>

      <title>A minimal model with stochastically broken reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14862v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including fluctuations of velocity and position, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is also derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production from Density Field Theories for interacting particles systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy production quantifies the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in non-equilibrium systems. Here, we develop a direct method to obtain closed, tractable expressions for entropy production in a broad class of dynamical density functional theories, from Dean's exact stochastic equation for microscopic densities to coarse-grained fluctuating-hydrodynamics models with density-dependent mobility. The method employs an Onsager-Machlup path-integral formulation. Our results reproduce particle-level calculations and matches recent Doi-Peliti treatments, confirming that the irregular noise structure of Dean's equation poses no obstacle when handled consistently. We further extend the framework to active mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions and to run-and-tumble or active-Brownian suspensions, generalizations that require a careful treatment of the spurious-drift. Our method furnishes a practical route to quantify irreversibility in density functional field theories and paves the way for systematic studies of entropy production in multi-field active fluids that couple density, momentum and orientation.</description>

      <title>Description using equilibrium temperature in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the thermodynamic quantities and the probability distribution, expressing the probability distribution as a function of the energy, in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics, which is characterized by the entropic parameter $q$, with the conventional expectation value. We treat the power-law-like distribution. The equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, is employed to describe the probability distribution. The Tsallis statistics represented by the equilibrium temperature was applied to $N$ harmonic oscillators, where $N$ is the number of the oscillators. The expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity were obtained. The expressions of these quantities and the expression of the probability distribution were obtained when the differences between adjacent energy levels are the same. These quantities and the distributions were numerically calculated. The $q$ dependences of the energy, the R\'enyi entropy, and the heat capacity are weak. In contrast, the Tsallis entropy depends on $q$. The probability distribution as a function of the energy depends on $N$ and $q$.</description>

      <title>When quenched and annealed pinning transitions coincide? A directed walk near a corrugated wall in disorders of various types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a discrete half-line $m \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) located at $m=0$, with distribution $Q(u_j)$. By computing the first two moments, $\la G_N \ra$ and $\la G_N^2 \ra$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over the disorder, we show that the pinning transition for $\la G_N^2 \ra$ may or may not coincide with that of $\la G_N \ra$, depending on the details of the disorder distribution $Q(u_j)$. This result reconciles opposite viewpoints on whether the pinning transition points in models with annealed and quenched disorder coincide or not.</description>

      <title>Harnessing higher-dimensional fluctuations in an information engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal performance of an information engine consisting of an overdamped Brownian bead confined in a controllable, $d$-dimensional harmonic trap and additionally subjected to gravity. The trap's center is updated dynamically via a feedback protocol designed such that no external work is done by the trap on the bead, while maximizing the extraction of gravitational potential energy and achieving directed motion. We show that performance strikingly improves when thermal fluctuations in directions perpendicular to gravity are harnessed. This improvement arises from feedback cooling of these transverse degrees of freedom, along which all heat is extracted; comparable performance can be achieved even without vertical measurements. This engine design modularizes the functions of harnessing fluctuations and storing free energy, drawing a close analogy to the Szilard engine.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Hybrid Optimization Method for Quantum Annealing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the performance of quantum annealing machines, several methods have been proposed to reduce the number of spins by fixing spin values through preprocessing. We proposed a hybrid optimization method that combines a simulated annealing (SA)-based non-quantum-type Ising machine with a quantum annealing machine. However, its applicability remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the hybrid method on large-size Ising models and analyzed its characteristics. The results indicate that the hybrid method improves upon solutions obtained by the preprocessing SA, even if the Ising models cannot be embedded in the quantum annealing machine. We analyzed the method from three perspectives: preprocessing, spin-fixed sub-Ising model generation method, and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine. From the viewpoint of the minimum energy gap, we found that solving the sub-Ising model with a quantum annealing machine results in a higher solution accuracy than solving the original Ising model. Additionally, we demonstrated that the number of fixed spins and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine affect the dependency of the solution accuracy on the sub-Ising model size.</description>

      <title>Using stochastic thermodynamics with internal variables to capture orientational spreading in cell populations undergoing cyclic stretch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the modeling framework introduced in [N. Loy and L. Preziosi: Bull. Math. Bio., 85, 2023] to describe the dynamics of cell orientation under cyclic stretch. We propose a reformulation based on the principles of Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables introduced in [T. Leadbetter, P. Purohit, and C. Reina: PNAS Nexus, 2, 2023]. This approach allows us to describe not only the evolution of the orientation distribution, but also the observed spreading phenomenon. The insight provided by our model reveals an interesting phenomenon, which we call two-stage reorientation: when cells begin aligned with an energy maximum, their orientations spread before concentrating at the energy minimum. This theoretical prediction suggests a new experiment to test this modeling framework.</description>

      <title>Disordered purification phase transition in hybrid random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu &lt; 2$ for uniform probability to $\nu &gt; 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially (quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition, leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement remains.</description>

      <title>Spectral BBGKY: a scalable scheme for nonlinear Boltzmann and correlation kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a time-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations. This framework advances our ability to investigate the early thermalization puzzle in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to elucidate the applicability of hydrodynamics at remarkably early stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagation, giving rise to a range of peculiar wave phenomena. In this work, we investigate Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices. Focusing on the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model, we uncover anisotropic hybrid modes (HMs) that exhibit skin localization along one direction and Anderson localization along the other. We determine the Anderson transition along different directions via the transfer matrix approach and finite-size scaling of Lyapunov exponents. This allows us to map out mobility edges that separate HMs from normal skin modes and Anderson localized modes (ALMs), revealing an ALM-HM-ALM reentrant transition. Our analysis extends to arbitrary dimensions, and we demonstrate the existence of skin-Anderson transitions on the infinite-dimensional nonreciprocal Bethe lattice using the forward-scattering approximation.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.</description>

      <title>A note on entropy of matter in presence of gravity: status of extensivity of entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy of matter in a very strong gravity depends on cross-sectional area of the container of the system -- is being further bolstered by calculating entropy of a monoatomic gas kept under uniform strong gravity at Newtonian scale. This bypasses the earlier analysis where existence of horizon is crucial. Also the extensivity of this entropy has been discussed in the light of the same of a two-space dimensional ultra-relativistic non-interacting gas without gravity. The whole analysis, as far as entropy is concerned, indicates that under strong gravity the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system are effectively contributed by the cross-sectional area of the system.</description>

      <title>Granovskii-Zhedanov Scar of XYZ Spin-chain: Modern Algebraic Perspectives and Realization in Higher Dimensional Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero entanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains; remarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a subject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding of quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be effectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) framework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This description, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of these standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques: approximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar subspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar subspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange systems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar construction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be supported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination numbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in specific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$ symmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial uniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in systems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges.</description>

      <title>Criticality in 1-dimensional field theories with mesoscopic, infinite range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of critical phenomena in one-dimensional field theories with long-range interactions has garnered significant attention following the implications of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, which precludes phase transitions in most low-dimensional theories with local interactions. This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a mesoscopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, and previously unidentified universality classes is evident.</description>

      <title>Meson mass spectrum in Ising Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-particle approximation of the Ising Field Theory (IFT), formulated in terms of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. Derived by Fonseca and Zamolodchikov as a systematic realization of the McCoy-Wu approach, this equation captures confinement by modeling ``mesons'' as bound states of two Majorana fermions (``quarks''), in a way analogous to the integral equation in the 't Hooft model. Despite its approximate nature, the BS equation provides remarkably accurate predictions for the mass spectrum of stable mesons across a wide range of parameters. Motivated by the striking structural similarity between the BS equation in IFT and the 't Hooft equation in two-dimensional QCD, we develop a new non-perturbative analytical framework inspired by the method of Fateev, Lukyanov, and Zamolodchikov (FLZ). Within this approach, we compute spectral sums and systematically derive the large-$n$ WKB expansion for the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which governs the spectrum of an infinite tower of mesons. We further examine how our analytical results capture the known behavior of the spectrum in well-studied asymptotic regimes, such as the $E_8$ limit and the free-fermion point, where exact solutions are available for comparison. Finally, we discuss how the obtained spectral data admit a natural analytic continuation to complex values of the parameters -- an extension that was one of the primary motivations for this work.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter describes systems whose constituents convert energy from their surroundings into directed motion, such as bacteria or catalytic colloids. We establish a thermodynamic law for dilute suspensions of interacting active particles in the form of a remarkable direct link between their dynamics and thermodynamics: The rate at which irreversibility is built up in the non-equilibrium steady state is a state function of the thermodynamic system parameters, namely the number of particles, the temperature and, as a distinctive characteristic of active matter, the swim pressure. Like in the famous fluctuation theorems of stochastic thermodynamics, irreversibility is a dynamical measure that quantifies the amount by which microscopic particle trajectories break time-reversal symmetry, without reference to the typically unobservable processes underlying self-propulsion. We derive the result for the paradigmatic model of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles with short-ranged repulsive interactions. Based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, we furthermore present a refined relation whose validity extends from the dilute into the phase-separated (MIPS) regime.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounded Current Fluctuation in One-Dimensional Driven Transport Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current fluctuation in one-dimensional driven transport systems is conjectured to have an upper bound determined by its mean value together with the driving force. The resulting inequality arises from repulsive interactions between the transporting particles, and the bound is approached in near-equilibrium systems or far-from-equilibrium systems with weak interactions between the transporting particles. First, a coarse-grained model for one-dimensional transport systems is proposed. This model describes random particle exchanges between two reservoirs with constant rates, and the upper bound is identified from this model. Then, the inequality is rigorously proved in quantum ballistic transport systems. In addition, two specific diffusive systems are used to demonstrate the validity of the inequality. One is the exclusion process for which the inequality is proven. The other is the transport of charged particles. For this system, the inequality is numerically supported.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01008v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the finite-timestep Brownian dynamics of a single particle confined in one dimension, with a nonuniform temperature profile. In such an open-boundary scenario, one cannot observe any net probability current in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). On the other hand, the nonequilibrium nature of this system is exhibited through the asymmetry in forward and backward transition probabilities, as is reported in this work through the stochastic simulation analysis and theoretical arguments. The irreversibility becomes prominent nearby the temperature interface. We propose that the observed irreversibility can be accounted for via a virtual-gyration scenario, while the collapse of virtual gyrations upon the one-dimensional coordinate leads to the absence of probability current.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations based on the $N \times N$ hermitian two-matrix model with the introduction of a loop-counting parameter and linear terms in the potential. We show that in the large-N limit even though the Ising model is classical, the critical temperature can reach absolute zero by tuning the loop-counting parameter, and the corresponding continuum theory turns out to be the quantised theory of neither pure gravity nor gravity coupled to conformal matter with central charge being 1/2.</description>

Abstract: We study the zero-temperature criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations to contemplate its physics. As it turns out, an inhomogeneous nature of the system yields an interesting phase diagram and the physics at the zero temperature is quite sensitive about how we cool down the system. We show the existence of a continuous parameter that characterizes the way we approach the zero-temperature critical point and it may enter in a critical exponent.</description>

Abstract: We consider the large deviations associated with the empirical mean of independent and identically distributed random variables under a subexponential moment condition. We show that non-trivial deviations are observable at a subexponential scale in the number of variables, and we provide the associated rate function, which is non-convex and is not derived from a Legendre-Fenchel transform. The proof adapts the one of Cramer's theorem to the case where the fluctuation is generated by a single variable. In particular, we develop a new tilting strategy for the lower bound, which leads us to introduce a condition on the second derivative of the moment generating function. Our results are illustrated by a couple of simple examples.</description>

Abstract: We study large deviations for the time average of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process raised to an arbitrary power. We prove that beyond a critical value, large deviations are subexponential in time, with a non-convex rate function whose main coefficient is given by the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi problem. Although a similar problem was addressed in a recent work, the originality of the paper is to provide a short, self-contained proof of this result through a couple of standard large deviations arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism and the finite-time scaling provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. Here we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. We find that despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the finite-time scaling form. This leads us to propose a criterion for the validity of Kibble-Zurek mechanism with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results generalize the Kibble-Zurek theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Our work not only brings fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides an approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>

Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analog simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our Letter defines a route for quantum analog simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mixed Steklov-Neumann spectral problem for the modified Helmholtz equation in a bounded domain when the Steklov condition is imposed on a connected subset of the smooth boundary. In order to deduce the asymptotic behavior in the limit when the size of the subset goes to zero, we reformulate the original problem in terms of an integral operator whose kernel is the restriction of a suitable Green's function (or pseudo-Green's function) to the subset. Its singular behavior on the boundary yields the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Steklov-Neumann problem. While this analysis remains at a formal level, it is supported by extensive numerical results for two basic examples: an arc on the boundary of a disk and a spherical cap on the boundary of a ball. Solving the original Steklov-Neumann problem numerically in these domains, we validate the asymptotic formulas and reveal their high accuracy, even when the subset is not small. A straightforward application of these spectral results to first-passage processes and diffusion-controlled reactions is presented. We revisit the small-target limit of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets. The effect of multiple failed reaction attempts is quantified by a universal function for the whole range of reactivities. Moreover, we extend these results to more sophisticated surface reactions that go beyond the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Sampling Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling decisions from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI-driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in stochastic optimal control. It extends the continuous-space, continuous-time Path Integral Diffusion sampling technique of [Behjoo, Chertkov 2025] to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network (GFN) framework of [Bengio, et al 2021]. In its most basic form an explicit formulation that does not require Neural Networks (NNs), DF leverages the linear solvability of the underlying MDP [Todorov, 2007] to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse-time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model -- compare DF to Metropolis-Hastings to quantify its efficiency, discuss potential NN-based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network study of the roughening transition in a (2 + 1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Space Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops when a single particle occupies every vertex. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $ d$-dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum North-East-Center model: steady-state phase diagram, universality and nonergodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.</description>
