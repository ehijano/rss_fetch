      <title>Dual Interpretation of Machine Learning Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning predictions are typically interpreted as the sum of contributions of predictors. Yet, each out-of-sample prediction can also be expressed as a linear combination of in-sample values of the predicted variable, with weights corresponding to pairwise proximity scores between current and past economic events. While this dual route leads nowhere in some contexts (e.g., large cross-sectional datasets), it provides sparser interpretations in settings with many regressors and little training data-like macroeconomic forecasting. In this case, the sequence of contributions can be visualized as a time series, allowing analysts to explain predictions as quantifiable combinations of historical analogies. Moreover, the weights can be viewed as those of a data portfolio, inspiring new diagnostic measures such as forecast concentration, short position, and turnover. We show how weights can be retrieved seamlessly for (kernel) ridge regression, random forest, boosted trees, and neural networks. Then, we apply these tools to analyze post-pandemic forecasts of inflation, GDP growth, and recession probabilities. In all cases, the approach opens the black box from a new angle and demonstrates how machine learning models leverage history partly repeating itself.</description>

      <title>The Logic of Counterfactuals and the Epistemology of Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11284v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics recognizes a type of causal model known as the Rubin causal model, or potential outcome framework, which deserves far more attention from philosophers than it currently receives. To spark philosophers' interest, I develop a dialectic connecting the Rubin causal model to the Lewis-Stalnaker debate on a logical principle of counterfactuals: Conditional Excluded Middle (CEM). I begin by playing good cop for CEM, developing a new argument in its favor -- a Quine-Putnam-style indispensability argument. This argument is based on the observation that CEM seems to be indispensable to the Rubin causal model, which underpins our best scientific theory of causal inference in health and social sciences -- a Nobel Prize-winning theory. Indeed, CEM has long remained a core assumption of the Rubin causal model, despite challenges from within the statistics and economics communities over twenty years ago. I then switch sides to play bad cop for CEM, undermining the indispensability argument by developing a new theory of causal inference that dispenses with CEM while preserving the successes of the original theory (thanks to a new theorem proved here). The key, somewhat surprisingly, is to integrate two approaches to causal modeling: the Rubin causal model, more familiar in health and social sciences, and the causal Bayes net, more familiar in philosophy. The good cop/bad cop dialectic is concluded with a connection to broader philosophical issues, including intertheory relations, the revisability of logic, and the role of background assumptions in justifying scientific inference.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Average Causal Effects in Fixed Effects Logit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00879v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies identification and estimation of average causal effects, such as average marginal or treatment effects, in fixed effects logit models with short panels. Relating the identified set of these effects to an extremal moment problem, we first show how to obtain sharp bounds on such effects simply, without any optimization. We also consider even simpler outer bounds, which, contrary to the sharp bounds, do not require any first-step nonparametric estimators. We build confidence intervals based on these two approaches and show their asymptotic validity. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that both approaches work well in practice, the second being typically competitive in terms of interval length. Finally, we show that our method is also useful to measure treatment effect heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Discrete Choice Models for Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two approaches to estimate semiparametric discrete choice models for bundles. Our first approach is a kernel-weighted rank estimator based on a matching-based identification strategy. We establish its complete asymptotic properties and prove the validity of the nonparametric bootstrap for inference. We then introduce a new multi-index least absolute deviations (LAD) estimator as an alternative, of which the main advantage is its capacity to estimate preference parameters on both alternative- and agent-specific regressors. Both methods can account for arbitrary correlation in disturbances across choices, with the former also allowing for interpersonal heteroskedasticity. We also demonstrate that the identification strategy underlying these procedures can be extended naturally to panel data settings, producing an analogous localized maximum score estimator and a LAD estimator for estimating bundle choice models with fixed effects. We derive the limiting distribution of the former and verify the validity of the numerical bootstrap as an inference tool. All our proposed methods can be applied to general multi-index models. Monte Carlo experiments show that they perform well in finite samples.</description>

      <title>General Seemingly Unrelated Local Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a framework for efficiently estimating impulse response functions with Local Projections (LPs). Our approach offers a Bayesian treatment for LPs with Instrumental Variables, accommodating multiple shocks and instruments per shock, accounts for autocorrelation in multi-step forecasts by jointly modeling all LPs as a seemingly unrelated system of equations, defines a flexible yet parsimonious joint prior for impulse responses based on a Gaussian Process, allows for joint inference about the entire vector of impulse responses, and uses all available data across horizons by imputing missing values.</description>

      <title>First-order integer-valued autoregressive processes with Generalized Katz innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new integer--valued autoregressive process (INAR) with Generalised Lagrangian Katz (GLK) innovations is defined. This process family provides a flexible modelling framework for count data, allowing for under and over--dispersion, asymmetry, and excess of kurtosis and includes standard INAR models such as Generalized Poisson and Negative Binomial as special cases. We show that the GLK--INAR process is discrete semi--self--decomposable, infinite divisible, stable by aggregation and provides stationarity conditions. Some extensions are discussed, such as the Markov--Switching and the zero--inflated GLK--INARs. A Bayesian inference framework and an efficient posterior approximation procedure are introduced. The proposed models are applied to 130 time series from Google Trend, which proxy the worldwide public concern about climate change. New evidence is found of heterogeneity across time, countries and keywords in the persistence, uncertainty, and long--run public awareness level.</description>
