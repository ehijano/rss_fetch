      <title>Comparing top-down and bottom-up holographic defects and boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider domain walls and end-of-the-world branes in AdS/CFT, holographically dual to codimension-one conformal defects and conformal boundaries respectively. In this setting there is an analogue of the ``bulk point'' singularity in boundary correlation functions, which we use to compare top-down and bottom-up constructions of these systems. For example, for a range of parameters the D3/D5 boundary CFT cannot be imitated by a tensionful end-of-the-world brane coupled to Einstein gravity, and in another range it can be modeled with a negative tension brane. Along the way we compute the central charge $b$ for the M2/M5 boundary CFT.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Dark Matter from the String Theory Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose heavy axions as a natural superheavy dark matter candidate in string theory, with the relic density of dark matter originating in quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation. String Theory is well known for the possibility of having tens to hundreds of axion-like particles -- the axiverse. Moduli stabilization generates high-scale masses for many of these, placing them naturally in the superheavy regime of particle physics. We consider moduli stabilization in the KKLT framework, featuring a single volume modulus and $C_4$ axion, and a fiducial inflation model minimally coupled to the volume modulus. We demonstrate that both the volume modulus and the axion can be abundantly produced through gravitational particle production. The former is unstable and readily decays to Standard Model particles while the latter (the axion) can be stable and survives to constitute the present day dark matter.</description>

      <title>A species scale-driven breakdown of effective field theory in time-dependent string backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel way in which effective field theory (EFT) can break down in cosmological string backgrounds depending on the behavior of the quantum gravity cutoff in infinite distance limits, known as the species scale $\Lambda_s$. Namely, EFT can break down if the species scale $\Lambda_s$ falls off so rapidly as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor grows from some initial value $a_i$ to some final value $a_f$ that the physical momentum of an initial Hubble-sized perturbation $\sim H_i^{-1}$ grows to exceed the species scale. For EFT to remain valid, a new condition $H_i \frac{a_i}{a_f} \ll \Lambda_{s,f}$ must hold, which is distinct from Trans-Planckian conditions discussed in the literature. Using the universal relation $\frac{\nabla m}{m} \cdot \frac{\nabla \Lambda_s}{\Lambda_s} = \frac{1}{d-2}$ in the infinite distance limits of moduli space where $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower and $\nabla$ measures variations with respect to the canonical metric on moduli space, we show that spatially flat FRW solutions in the string landscape violate this condition or at best marginally satisfy it. However, we find that sufficiently large negative spatial curvature always avoids a breakdown. To avoid EFT breakdown, we derive an upper bound on the duration of quasi-de Sitter expansion that classically evolves to decelerated expansion. Our bound is proportional to the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) bound, with the advantage that it applies to any FRW solution in the string landscape. Finally, we distinguish EFT breakdown from TCC violation, the latter being a quantum gravity constraint rather than an EFT limitation. Perhaps our most surprising finding is that in any flat FRW solution that develops a weakly coupled string at future infinity the EFT inevitably breaks down.</description>

      <title>Analytic approaches to anisotropic holographic superfluids in asymptotically hyperscaing viloation geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore anisotropic holographic superfluidity and find analytic solutions near critical point where superfluid/normalfluid phase transition appears in a holographic dual fluid system. In arXiv:hep-th/1109.4592, the authors obtained such an analytic solution in 5-dimensional Einstein-SU(2)Yang-Mills system, and it is asymptotically AdS$_5$. What is more in this note is that we get analytic solutions near the critical point in 3- and 4- dimensional Einstein-Scalar-U(1)$\times$SU(2)Yang-Mills systems, which become asymptotically hyperscaling violation geometry. We also get leading order back reactions to the background geometry, which clearly show spatial anisotropy of the bulk geometry. To explore the properties of the spacetime, we compute holographic entanglement entropy and confirm that the superfluid/normalfluid phase transition must occur at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Two faces of $N=7,8$ superconformal mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two variants of $N=7$ superconformal mechanics with manifest $so(7)$ and $su(2) \times su(2)$ $R$-symmetries possessing exceptional $G(3)$ dynamical symmetry are presented. To construct these $G(3)$ theories, we developed two new versions of covariant embedding of the exceptional $g_2$ algebra into the $so(7)$ algebra and then the embedding of $so(7)$ into $so(8)$. As a result, two $N=8$ superconformal mechanics with the $OSp(8|2)$ and $F(4)$ superconformal algebras and $N=7, G(3)$ superconformal mechanics were constructed in a uniform way. The constants of the octonion multiplication play a key role in the construction of superconformal mechanics with manifest $so(7)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>High Energy String Theory and the Celestial Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on a string world-sheet connection to flat space-time holography. More specifically, in the high energy (zero tension) limit of tree-level string scattering in flat backgrounds the underlying string world-sheets can be related to the celestial sphere, with the saddle points of the high energy string description representing points on the celestial sphere. We show that this picture continues to hold at all subleading orders in the quantum fluctuations around this classical configuration. As a consequence there is a dual description of the high energy limit of string theory as the large energy expansion on the celestial sphere organized by (light) higher spin modes. This approach points to an intrinsic construction of celestial conformal field theory (CFT) by relating it to a (free) world-sheet CFT of string theory. We also elaborate on the high energy representations of tree-level open and closed string amplitudes and work out their subleading corrections. Their number theoretic properties and relevance as amplitudes of tensionless strings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Modular Hamiltonian of holographic time band states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A holographic time band is a causal incomplete boundary spacetime subregion whose causal wedge is a causal complete bulk spacetime subregion. In an AdS$_3$ spacetime with a specifically modified IR geometry, its causal wedge coincides with its entanglement wedge, which suggests the existence of a local modular Hamiltonian for the holographic time band state. In this work, we construct the local modular Hamiltonian for holographic time bands using two independent methods: from the quantum information properties of the time band state and from the construction of consistent geometric modular flows. Both methods lead to the same unique result of the local modular Hamiltonian, reflecting the intrinsic property of the time band state. The entanglement first law has also been checked to hold for the simplest time band state. This is a substantial addition to the known holographic subsystems with a local modular Hamiltonian, beyond the few cases previously identified.</description>

      <title>On Refined Vogel's universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13831v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In accordance with P. Vogel, a set of algebra structures in Chern-Simons theory can be made universal, independent of a particular family of simple Lie algebras. In particular, this means that various quantities in the adjoint representations of these simple Lie algebras such as dimensions and quantum dimensions, Racah coefficients, etc. are simple rational functions of two parameters on Vogel's plane, giving three lines associated with $sl$, $so/sp$ and exceptional algebras correspondingly. By analyzing the partition function of refined of Chern-Simons theory, it was suggested earlier that the refinement may preserve the universality for simply laced algebras. Here we support this conjecture by analysing the Macdonald dimensions, i.e. values of Macdonald polynomials at $q^\rho$, where $\rho$ is the Weyl vector: there is a universality formula that describes these dimensions for the simply laced algebras as a function on the Vogel's plane.</description>

      <title>Naturally Resonant Dark Matter from Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00076v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the mass resonance structure that naturally arises from extra-dimensional models. The resonance can enhance the dark matter annihilation as well as self-interaction. We demonstrate such a resonance structure by considering the fermionic dark matter and dark photon models on an $S^1/(Z_2 \times Z_2')$ orbifold. We also note that this model embeds dark matter axial vector coupling to the dark photon, which opens up the viable dark matter parameter space. We then present the unique predictions for direct-detection experiments and accelerator searches.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Longitudinal Development of Electromagnetic Air Showers: Analytical Improvements to the Greisen Formalism with Zenith Angle Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new analytical approach to the longitudinal development of electromagnetic air showers, offering improvements to the classical Greisen formalism. We introduce a novel profile for the slope function $\lambda_1(s)$ that achieves an agreement less than $0.75\%$ with the original $\lambda_1$ for shower age parameter $s$ between $0.3 &lt; s &lt; 1.4$, where $s$ represents the stage of shower development. Our new formalism provides an improved representation of shower evolution, particularly near and beyond the shower maximum. In addition, we derive a complete expression for the number of particles $N(t)$. Our implementation includes the zenithal angle dependence on the number of particles at the detector level at high altitudes, making it particularly useful for high-altitude observatories. This expression is suitable for implementing air shower simulation tool fitting procedures over a wide range of energies and geometries. Our analysis suggests that the proposed new formalism may provide better agreement with the expected evolution of particle numbers compared to the traditional Greisen formulation.</description>

      <title>How Accidental was Inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are discriminating between different models of inflation, disfavoring simple monomial potentials whilst being consistent with models whose predictions resemble those of the Starobinsky $R + R^2$ cosmological model. However, this model may suffer from theoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value, threatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of light states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be lower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation, leading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity models can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate the CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of $10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit realisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation' parameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to the Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter values that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO data, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values, thereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial conditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.</description>

      <title>The Schott term in the binding energy for compact binaries on circular orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phasing for compact binary systems on circular orbits was obtained in arXiv:2304.11185 at fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order thanks to two main ingredients: the 4PN conservative energy (associated to a nonradiative spacetime) in terms of the orbital frequency and the 4.5PN flux in terms of the waveform frequency (i.e., the half-frequency of the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode). When obtaining the phasing, a key physical postulate was made: the expression of the binding energy in terms of the waveform frequency was assumed to be identical to the expression of the conservative energy in terms of the orbital frequency. This postulate was necessary to ensure that the frequency evolution obtained through the flux-balance law (which involves the binding energy) was independent of the choice of spacetime foliation. In this work, I show that the binding energy entering the flux-balance law differs from the 4PN conservative energy by a 4PN pseudo-Schott term, associated with radiation-reaction effects due to gravitational tails. Unlike the usual Schott terms (at 2.5PN, 3.5PN and 4.5PN), the pseudo-Schott term is not a total derivative and is in fact hereditary, so it does not vanish for circular orbits. Remarkably, the binding energy thus obtained is in perfect agreement with the one obtained using the aforementioned physical postulate, which confirms that the 4.5PN phasing associated to the waveform frequency computed in arXiv:2304.11185 is indeed correct. This result is extended to the other Poincar\'e invariants, and `thermodynamic' relations between the binding energy and angular momentum are established. Finally, the chirp and phasing associated to the orbital frequency are presented at 4.5PN, including horizon-absorption effects.</description>

      <title>Torsional Hall Viscosity of Massive Chern Insulators: Magnetic Field and Momentum Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the non-dissipative, parity-odd spin transport of (2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic electrons, generated by torsion, and the torsional Hall viscosity $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$. We first determine $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ for massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a constant electromagnetic field. We predict that the magnetic field induces a contribution to $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ competing with the one originating from the Dirac mass. Moreover, we quantify the impact on $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ originating from the band structure deformation quadratic in momentum terms that was proposed by Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ). We find that the BHZ deformation enhances $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ in magnitude, but reverses its sign as compared to the standard massive Dirac fermion, indicating a Hall response in opposite direction to the typical Hall viscous force. Nevertheless, the torsional Hall viscosity still discriminates between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes. Our results, hence, pave the way for a deeper understanding of hydrodynamic spin transport and its possible verification in experiments.</description>

      <title>Light Scalar Fields Foster Production of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields are ubiquitous in theories of high-energy physics. In the context of cosmic inflation, this suggests the existence of spectator fields, which provide a subdominant source of energy density. We show that spectator fields boost the inflationary production of primordial black holes, with single-field ultra-slow roll evolution supplanted by a phase of evolution along the spectator direction, and primordial perturbations amplified by the resulting multifield dynamics. This generic mechanism is largely free from the severe fine-tuning that afflicts single-field inflationary PBH models.</description>

      <title>Universal non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states and density-dependent thermalization in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We support our large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.</description>

      <title>From Lorentz to $SIM(2)$: contraction, four-dimensional algebraic relations and projective representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on $SIM(2)$ and $ISIM(2)$ groups, their representations and algebraic aspects. After obtaining $SIM(2)$ through the In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction procedure, a complete four-dimensional algebraic representation is shown for $\mathfrak{sim(2)}$ and $\mathfrak{isim(2)}$. Besides that, we apply Bargmann's formalism to investigate the (projective) representations for both cases, keeping track of the source of phase factors. We complete the study by presenting a particularly simple analysis to probe the existence of local phase factors, which is useful when dealing with non-abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reader surely knows what particles physics is about: finding building blocks of nature that appear elementary at a given time and study their interactions - so why in the world this essay? The problem is how to arrive at a fundamental theory, and maybe even more important, what is the theory supposed to do? I follow here a simple but profound prescription of Feynman for a true, self-contained theory, and then show how the Standard Model beautifully illustrates this prescription. That the issue is not trivial, is clear from the fact that we had theories dominate our field for decades, in spite of completely failing Feynman's requirements and offering no clear predictions whatsoever. I next critically review two unique candidates for a Beyond Standard Model theory: the Left-Right Symmetric theory of electro-weak interactions and the minimal grand unified theory based on SU(5) gauge symmetry. I also comment on some generic aspects of grand unification, and what hope we may have in testing it.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Thermodynamic Properties of Frolov Black Holes with Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated a modified Frolov black hole (BH) model that incorporates both a global monopole (GM) and a cosmic string (CS) to explore the interplay between non-singular BH regularization and topological defect effects. In our study, we derived a spacetime metric characterized by a regulated core through a length scale parameter $\alpha$ and introduced additional modifications via the GM parameter $\eta$ and the CS parameter $a$, which collectively alter the horizon structure and causal geometry of the BH. We analyzed the thermodynamic properties by deriving expressions for the mass function, Hawking temperature, and entropy, and found that the inclusion of GM and CS significantly deviates the BH entropy from the conventional Bekenstein-Hawking area law, while numerical investigations showed that the shadow radius exhibits contrasting behaviors: the Frolov parameters tend to reduce the shadow size whereas the topological defects enhance it. Furthermore, we examined the dynamics of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations by solving the massless Klein-Gordon equation in the BH background and computed the quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the WKB approximation, which confirmed the BH's stability and revealed that the oscillation frequencies and damping rates are strongly dependent on the parameters $\alpha$, $q$, $\eta$, and $a$. Our results suggest that the distinct observational signatures arising from this composite BH model may provide a promising avenue for testing modified gravity theories in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity from Kadanoff-Baym equations: fluid dynamics and microscopic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a first principles, systematic framework for determining the bubble wall velocity during a first order cosmological phase transition. This framework, based on non-local Kadanoff-Baym equations, incorporates both macroscopic fluid dynamics and microscopic interactions between the bubble wall and particles in the plasma. Previous studies have generally focused on one of these two sources of friction pressure that govern the wall velocity. As a precursor, we utilize background field quantum field theory to obtain the relevant local Boltzmann equations, from which we derive the forces associated with variation of particle masses across the bubble wall and the microscopic wall-particle interactions. We subsequently show how these equations emerge from the Kadanoff-Baym framework under various approximations. We apply this framework in the ballistic regime to compute the new friction force arising from the $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering processes in scalar field theory. We obtain a linear relationship between this force and the Lorentz factor $\gamma_w$ that would preclude runaway bubbles with such effects.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall dynamics from nonequilibrium quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled dynamics between the bubble wall and the plasma from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. The commonly used equation of motion of the bubble wall in the kinetic approach is shown to be incomplete. In the language of the two-particle-irreducible effective action, the conventional equation misses higher-loop terms generated by the condensate-particle type vertices (e.g.,~$\varphi\phi\chi^2$, where $\varphi$ is the background field describing the bubble wall, $\phi$ the corresponding particle excitation and $\chi$ another particle species in the plasma). From the missing terms, we identify an additional dissipative friction which is contributed by particle production processes from the condensate-particle type vertices. We also show how other transmission processes beyond the 1-to-1 elementary transmission studied in the literature for ultrarelativistic bubble walls, e.g., 1-to-1 mixing and 1-to-2 transition radiation, can be understood from the kinetic approach.</description>

      <title>Comments on a Paper by Narovlansky and Verlinde</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double-scaled infinite temperature limit of the SYK model has been conjectured by Rahman and Susskind (RS) [1, 2, 3, 4], and independently by Verlinde [5] to be dual to a certain low dimensional de Sitter space. In a recent discussion of this conjecture Narovlansky and Verlinde (NV) [6] came to conclusions which radically differ from those of RS. In particular these conclusions disagree by factors which diverge as $N \to \infty$. Among these is a mismatch between the scaling of boundary entropy and bulk horizon area. In this note, we point out differences in two key assumptions made by RS and NV which lead to these mismatches, and explain why we think the RS assumptions are correct. When the NV assumptions, which we believe are unwarranted, are replaced by those of RS, the conclusions match both RS and the standard relation between entropy and area.
  In the process of discussing these, we will shed some light on: the various notions of temperature that appear in the duality; the relationship between Hamiltonian energy and bulk mass; and the location of bulk conical defect states in the spectrum of DSSYK$_{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Carroll Galileons in Three Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first example of an interacting Carroll supersymmetric field theory with both temporal and spatial derivatives, belonging to the Galileon class, where the non-linear field equation remains second-order in derivative. To achieve this, we introduce two novel tools. First, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional Galilei/Carroll duality can be extended to higher dimensions, and includes the supersymmetry, by expressing the generators in a spinor basis. We then show that Carroll superalgebras are naturally connected to Euclidean, rather than Poincar\'e, superalgebras. Using the real multiplet of the three-dimensional N $=1$ Euclidean supersymmetry, we construct the scalar multiplet for N $=2$ Carroll supersymmetry and develop a tensor calculus to realize the aforementioned model. These results offer new insights into the structure of genuine higher-dimensional Carroll field theories and Carroll supersymmetry. While these tools are utilized to build a specific model, we anticipate that they possess broader applications in Carrollian physics.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach for loop integral reduction in the Feynman parametrization using intersection theory and relative cohomology. In this framework, Feynman integrals correspond to boundary-supported differential forms in the language of relative cohomology. The integral reduction can then be achieved by computing intersection numbers. We apply our method in several examples to demonstrate its correctness, and discuss the subtleties in certain degenerate limits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross-section of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how to detect the large quantum fluctuations in the throat of a near-extremal black hole, where the dynamics are governed by the Schwarzian theory. To this end, we scatter a low-frequency wave of a massless, minimal scalar off the black hole and calculate the absorption cross-section. In the semiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the universal result that the cross-section equals the horizon area. However, in the strongly coupled regime, where quantum fluctuations dominate, we find that the absorption cross-section exceeds the semiclassical prediction. This result may seem counterintuitive, given that the density of black hole states is suppressed in this regime. Nevertheless, two effects outweigh this suppression. First, quantum fluctuations enhance absorption transitions between individual states, with the effect becoming stronger closer to the ground state. Second, these fluctuations significantly reduce stimulated emission. We conclude that a measurement showing an enhanced absorption cross-section serves as a clear signature of the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that an infinite subset of the static, parity-even Love number couplings vanish, to all orders in perturbation theory. This conclusion holds even if the tidal field deviates from axisymmetry. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate gravitational lensing within the space-time framework of traversable wormholes, focusing on the combined effects of a global monopole and a cosmic string. Specifically, we examine the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole metric and analyze how these topological defects influence photon trajectories. By considering the weak-field limit, we derive analytical expressions for the photon deflection angle, highlighting how factors such as the wormhole throat radius, the global monopole charge, and the cosmic string influence the gravitational lensing phenomenon. We also examine the weak-field limit of lensing phenomena for a zero wormhole throat radius and derive an analytical expression for the deflection angle of photon light in this scenario.</description>

Abstract: We study the coupling selection rules associated with non-group symmetries, i.e., $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We clarify which Yukawa textures can be derived by our selection rules for $M=3, 4$, and 5, and obtain various textures including the the nearest neighbor interaction type and its extension. Some of them cannot be realized by a conventional group-like symmetry. They lead to interesting phenomenology such as a solution to the strong CP problem without axion.</description>

Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>

Abstract: An accurate description of the scalar potential at finite temperature is crucial for studying cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPT) in the early Universe. At finite temperatures, a precise treatment of thermal resummations is essential, as bosonic fields encounter significant infrared issues that can compromise standard perturbative approaches. The Partial Dressing (or the tadpole resummation) method provides a self consistent resummation of higher order corrections, allowing the computation of thermal masses and the effective potential including the proper Boltzmann suppression factors and without relying on any high-temperature approximation. We systematically compare the Partial dressing resummation scheme results with the Parwani and Arnold Espinosa (AE) ones to investigate the thermal phase transition dynamics in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Our findings reveal that different resummation prescriptions can significantly alter the nature of the phase transition within the same region of parameter space, confirming the differences that have already been noticed between the Parwani and AE schemes. Notably, the more refined resummation prescription, the Partial Dressing scheme, does not support symmetry non-restoration in 2HDM at high temperatures observed using the AE prescription. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties in the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from an FOPT due to variations in resummation methods, illustrating their role in shaping theoretical predictions for upcoming GW experiments. Finally, we discuss the capability of the High-Luminosity LHC and proposed GW experiments to probe the FOEWPT-favored region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory from classical mechanics near equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider classical theories described by Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ that have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. We assume that the sum of squares of generalized momenta and generalized coordinates is an integral of motion. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.</description>
