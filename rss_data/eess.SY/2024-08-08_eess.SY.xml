      <title>Minimal L2-Consistent Data-Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider non-collocated sensors and actuators, and we address the problem of minimizing the number of sensor-to-actuator transmissions while ensuring that the L2 gain of the system remains under a threshold. By using causal factorization and system level synthesis, we reformulate this problem as a rank minimization problem over a convex set. When heuristics like nuclear norm minimization are used for rank minimization, the resulting matrix is only numerically low rank and must be truncated, which can lead to an infeasible solution. To address this issue, we introduce approximate causal factorization to control the factorization error and provide a bound on the degradation of the L2 gain in terms of the factorization error. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using a benchmark.</description>

      <title>From Black Box to Clarity: AI-Powered Smart Grid Optimization with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is the first to adopt Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence, for smart grid optimizations. To fully leverage KAN's interpretability, a general framework is proposed considering complex uncertainties. The stochastic optimal power flow problem in hybrid AC/DC systems is chosen as a particularly tough case study for demonstrating the effectiveness of this framework.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Battery-Electric Bus Charging under Stochasticity using a Receding-Horizon Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge of adopting battery electric buses into fleets lies in scheduling the charging, which in turn is complicated by considerations such as timing constraints imposed by routes, long charging times, limited numbers of chargers, and utility cost structures. This work builds on previous network-flow-based charge scheduling approaches and includes both consumption and demand time-of-use costs while accounting for uncontrolled loads on the same meter. Additionally, a variable-rate, non-linear partial charging model compatible with the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is developed for increased charging fidelity. To respond to feedback in an uncertain environment, the resulting MILP is adapted to a hierarchical receding horizon planner that utilizes a static plan for the day as a reference to follow while reacting to stochasticity on a regular basis. This receding horizon planner is analyzed with Monte-Carlo techniques alongside two other possible planning methods. It is found to provide up to 52\% cost savings compared to a non-time-of-use aware method and significant robustness benefits compared to an optimal open-loop method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing based Power Grid Partitioning for Parallel Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph partitioning has many applications in powersystems from decentralized state estimation to parallel simulation. Focusing on parallel simulation, optimal grid partitioning minimizes the idle time caused by different simulation times for the sub-networks and their components and reduces the overhead required to simulate the cuts. Partitioning a graph into two parts such that, for example, the cut is minimal and the subgraphs have equal size is an NP-hard problem. In this paper we show how optimal partitioning of a graph can be obtained using quantum annealing (QA). We show how to map the requirements for optimal splitting to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation and test the proposed formulation using a current D-Wave QPU. We show that the necessity to find an embedding of the QUBO on current D-Wave QPUs limits the problem size to under 200 buses and notably affects the time-to-solution. We finally discuss the implications on near-term implementation of QA in combination to traditional CPU or GPU based simulation.</description>

      <title>A Robust Clustering Scheme for Vehicular Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering, as a technique for grouping nodes in geographical proximity together, in vehicular communication networks, is a key technique to enhance network robustness and scalability despite challenges such as mobility and routing. This paper presents a robust clustering scheme based on cluster head backup list algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted vehicular communication network, where multiple UAVs act as communication base stations for a vehicular network. To tackle the high mobility issues in vehicular communications, instead of allowing direct communication between all vehicles to the UAV, clustering methods will potentially be efficient in overcoming delay limitations, excessive power consumption and resource issues. Using the clustering technique, neighboring vehicles are grouped into clusters with a specific vehicle selected as the cluster head (CH) in each cluster. The selected CH connects directly to the UAV through an infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) link, subsequently establishing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications with vehicles in the same cluster. To increase cluster connectivity period, the proposed clustering scheme is developed based on considering the vehicle behavior for efficient selection of CHs and providing a CH backup list to maintain the stability of the cluster structure. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed system outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of clustering stability and reliability. It is also shown that the performance of the proposed scheme is not much affected by the increase in the number of vehicles. This indicates that the proposed scheme can be efficient in dense vehicular networks where resource constraints pose significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence based Approach for Identification and Mitigation of Cyber-Attacks in Wide-Area Control of Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep learning method that serves the dual role of both identification and mitigation of cyber-attacks in wide-area damping control loops of power systems. Two specific types of attacks considered are false data injection and denial-of-service (DoS). Unlike existing methods, which are either model-based or model-free and yet require two separate learning modules for detection and mitigation leading to longer response times before clearing an attack, our deep learner incorporate both goals within the same integrated framework. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder based GAN is proposed that captures the temporal dynamics of the power system significantly more accurately than fully-connected GANs, thereby providing better accuracy and faster response for both goals. The method is validated using the IEEE 68-bus power system model.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented UAV Communication Design and Optimization for Target Tracking: A MachineLearning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accomplish various tasks, safe and smooth control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) needs to be guaranteed, which cannot be met by existing ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). This has attracted the attention of the communication field, where most existing work mainly focused on optimizing communication performance (i.e., delay) and ignored the performance of the task (i.e., tracking accuracy). To explore the effectiveness of communication in completing a task, in this letter, we propose a goal-oriented communication framework adopting a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a proactive repetition scheme (DeepP) to optimize C&amp;C data selection and the maximum number of repetitions in a real-time target tracking task, where a base station (BS) controls a UAV to track a mobile target. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated by comparing it with the traditional proportional integral derivative (PID) algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Convergence of Subgraph Generated Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of random graph models - termed subgraph generated models (SUGMs) - initially developed by Chandrasekhar and Jackson in which higher-order structures are explicitly included in the network formation process. We use matrix concentration inequalities to show convergence of the adjacency matrix of networks realized from such SUGMs to the expected adjacency matrix as a function of the network size. We apply this result to study concentration of centrality measures (such as degree, eigenvector, and Katz centrality) in sampled networks to the corresponding centralities in the expected network, thus proving that node importance can be predicted from knowledge of the random graph model without the need of exact network data.</description>

      <title>Real time parameter estimation for adaptive OFDM/OTFS selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless communication systems must simultaneously address multiple challenges to ensure accurate data detection, deliver high Quality of Service (QoS), adding enable a high data transmission with low system design. Additionally, they need to reduce energy consumption and latency without increasing system complexity. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a commonly used waveform in 4G and 5G systems, it has limitations in handling significant delay and Doppler spread in high mobility scenarios. To overcome these weaknesses, a novel waveform named Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) has been proposed, which aims to improve upon OFDM by closely matching signals to channel behavior. In this study, we propose a novel strategy that enables operators to dynamically select the best waveform based on estimated mobile user parameters. We use an Integrated Radar Sensing and Communication System (ISAC) to estimate delay and Doppler, as well as speed and range. This approach allows the base station to adapt to the mobile target, thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems in high mobility and low complexity scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show that it outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>A self-adaptive system of systems architecture to enable its ad-hoc scalability: Unmanned Vehicle Fleet -- Mission Control Center Case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A System of Systems (SoS) comprises Constituent Systems (CSs) that interact to provide unique capabilities beyond any single CS. A key challenge in SoS is ad-hoc scalability, meaning the system size changes during operation by adding or removing CSs. This research focuses on an Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) as a practical SoS example, addressing uncertainties like mission changes, range extensions, and UV failures. The proposed solution involves a self-adaptive system that dynamically adjusts UVF architecture, allowing the Mission Control Center (MCC) to scale UVF size automatically based on performance criteria or manually by operator decision. A multi-agent environment and rule management engine were implemented to simulate and verify this approach.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Semantic-Enabled 6G Communication: A Task-oriented and Privacy-preserving Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) emerges as an innovative approach in the 6G landscape, characterized by the transmission of only vital information that is directly pertinent to a specific task. While ToSC offers an efficient mode of communication, it concurrently raises concerns regarding privacy, as sophisticated adversaries might possess the capability to reconstruct the original data from the transmitted features. This article provides an in-depth analysis of privacy-preserving strategies specifically designed for ToSC relying on deep neural network-based joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC). The study encompasses a detailed comparative assessment of trustworthy feature perturbation methods such as differential privacy and encryption, alongside intrinsic security incorporation approaches like adversarial learning to train the JSCC and learning-based vector quantization (LBVQ). This comparative analysis underscores the integration of advanced explainable learning algorithms into communication systems, positing a new benchmark for privacy standards in the forthcoming 6G era.</description>

      <title>F1tenth Autonomous Racing With Offline Reinforcement Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing serves as a critical platform for evaluating automated driving systems and enhancing vehicle mobility intelligence. This work investigates offline reinforcement learning methods to train agents within the dynamic F1tenth racing environment. The study begins by exploring the challenges of online training in the Austria race track environment, where agents consistently fail to complete the laps. Consequently, this research pivots towards an offline strategy, leveraging `expert' demonstration dataset to facilitate agent training. A waypoint-based suboptimal controller is developed to gather data with successful lap episodes. This data is then employed to train offline learning-based algorithms, with a subsequent analysis of the agents' cross-track performance, evaluating their zero-shot transferability from seen to unseen scenarios and their capacity to adapt to changes in environment dynamics. Beyond mere algorithm benchmarking in autonomous racing scenarios, this study also introduces and describes the machinery of our return-conditioned decision tree-based policy, comparing its performance with methods that employ fully connected neural networks, Transformers, and Diffusion Policies and highlighting some insights into method selection for training autonomous agents in driving interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory offers a rigorous treatment of dynamics and has been emerging as a powerful modeling and learning-based control method enabling significant advancements across various domains of robotics. Due to its ability to represent nonlinear dynamics as a linear operator, Koopman theory offers a fresh lens through which to understand and tackle the modeling and control of complex robotic systems. Moreover, it enables incremental updates and is computationally inexpensive making it particularly appealing for real-time applications and online active learning. This review comprehensively presents recent research results on advancing Koopman operator theory across diverse domains of robotics, encompassing aerial, legged, wheeled, underwater, soft, and manipulator robotics. Furthermore, it offers practical tutorials to help new users get started as well as a treatise of more advanced topics leading to an outlook on future directions and open research questions. Taken together, these provide insights into the potential evolution of Koopman theory as applied to the field of robotics.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the dynamics of a network of diffusively-coupled bistable systems. Under mild conditions and without requiring smoothness of the vector field, we analyze the network dynamics and show that the solutions converge globally to the set of equilibria for generic monotone (but not necessarily strictly monotone) regulatory functions. Sufficient conditions for global state synchronization are provided. Finally, by adopting a piecewise linear approximation of the vector field, we determine the existence, location and stability of the equilibria as function of the coupling gain. The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>BPMP-Tracker: A Versatile Aerial Target Tracker Using Bernstein Polynomial Motion Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a versatile trajectory planning pipeline for aerial tracking. The proposed tracker is capable of handling various chasing settings such as complex unstructured environments, crowded dynamic obstacles and multiple-target following. Among the entire pipeline, we focus on developing a predictor for future target motion and a chasing trajectory planner. For rapid computation, we employ the sample-check-select strategy: modules sample a set of candidate movements, check multiple constraints, and then select the best trajectory. Also, we leverage the properties of Bernstein polynomials for quick calculations. The prediction module predicts the trajectories of the targets, which do not overlap with static and dynamic obstacles. Then the trajectory planner outputs a trajectory, ensuring various conditions such as occlusion and collision avoidance, the visibility of all targets within a camera image and dynamical limits. We fully test the proposed tracker in simulations and hardware experiments under challenging scenarios, including dual-target following, environments with dozens of dynamic obstacles and complex indoor and outdoor spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of the cubic-regularized Newton method within a federated learning framework while addressing two major concerns that commonly arise in federated learning: privacy leakage and communication bottleneck. We introduce a federated learning algorithm called Differentially Private Federated Cubic Regularized Newton (DP-FCRN). By leveraging second-order techniques, our algorithm achieves lower iteration complexity compared to first-order methods. We also incorporate noise perturbation during local computations to ensure privacy. Furthermore, we employ sparsification in uplink transmission, which not only reduces the communication costs but also amplifies the privacy guarantee. Specifically, this approach reduces the necessary noise intensity without compromising privacy protection. We analyze the convergence properties of our algorithm and establish the privacy guarantee. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on a benchmark dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable and resilient energy development. To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy production, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are needed. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic factors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This study explores a non-parametric method based on \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy prediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for the DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional scripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.</description>

      <title>A Learning-Based Model Predictive Contouring Control for Vehicle Evasive Manoeuvres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Learning-based Model Predictive Contouring Control (L-MPCC) algorithm for evasive manoeuvres at the limit of handling. The algorithm uses the Student-t Process (STP) to minimise model mismatches and uncertainties online. The proposed STP captures the mismatches between the prediction model and the measured lateral tyre forces and yaw rate. The mismatches correspond to the posterior means provided to the prediction model to improve its accuracy. Simultaneously, the posterior covariances are propagated to the vehicle lateral velocity and yaw rate along the prediction horizon. The STP posterior covariance directly depends on the variance of observed data, so its variance is more significant when the online measurements differ from the recorded ones in the training set and smaller in the opposite case. Thus, these covariances can be utilised in the L-MPCC's cost function to minimise the vehicle state uncertainties. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate that the proposed L-MPCC can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre at a higher velocity than an MPCC without STP. Furthermore, the proposed controller yields a significantly lower peak sideslip angle, improving the vehicle's manoeuvrability compared to an L-MPCC with a Gaussian Process.</description>

      <title>Inference with the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm in the context of multiarmed bandit problems and discuss its implication in downstream inferential tasks. While inferential tasks become challenging when data is collected in a sequential manner, we argue that this problem can be alleviated when the sequential algorithm at hand satisfies certain stability property. This notion of stability is motivated from the seminal work of Lai and Wei (1982). Our first main result shows that such a stability property is always satisfied for the UCB algorithm, and as a result the sample means for each arm are asymptotically normal. Next, we examine the stability properties of the UCB algorithm when the number of arms $K$ is allowed to grow with the number of arm pulls $T$. We show that in such a case the arms are stable when $\frac{\log K}{\log T} \rightarrow 0$, and the number of near-optimal arms are large.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Control of Nonlinear Systems using Carleman Approximation: Structured and Unstructured Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) control designs for input-affine nonlinear systems. We use Carleman linearization to express the state-space representation of the nonlinear dynamical model in the Carleman space, and develop a real-time algorithm that can learn nonlinear state-feedback controllers using state and input measurements in the infinite-dimensional Carleman space. Thereafter, we study the practicality of having a finite-order truncation of the control signal, followed by its closed-loop stability analysis. Finally, we develop two additional designs that can learn structured as well as sparse representations of the RL-based nonlinear controller, and provide theoretical conditions for ensuring their closed-loop stability. We present numerical examples to show how our proposed method generates closed-loop responses that are close to the optimal performance of the nonlinear plant. We also compare our designs to other data-driven nonlinear RL control methods such as those based on neural networks, and illustrate their relative advantages and drawbacks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Impact of Uncertain Wildfire Risk on Power Grids through Topology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant threat to the safe and reliable operations of the electric grid. To mitigate wildfire risk, system operators resort to public safety power shutoffs, or PSPS, that shed load for a subset of customers. As wildfire risk forecasts are stochastic, such decision-making may often be sub-optimal. This paper proposes a two-stage topology control problem that jointly minimizes generation and load-shedding costs in the face of uncertain fire risk. Compared to existing work, we include preand post-event topology control actions and consider scenarios where the wildfire risk is known with low and high confidence. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a benchmark test system, artificially geo-located in Southern California, and using stochastic wildfire risk data that exists in the literature. Our work provides a crucial study of the comparative benefits of pre-event versus post-event control and the effects of wildfire risk accuracy on each control strategy.</description>

      <title>Drift Control of High-Dimensional RBM: A Computational Method Based on Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a stochastic control problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The controlled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the orthant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector $\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at time $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\theta(t)$. In our initial problem formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic control problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2018, 8505-8510), we develop and illustrate a simulation-based computational method that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. For test problems studied thus far, our method is accurate to within a fraction of one percent, and is computationally feasible in dimensions up to at least $d=30$.</description>

      <title>Feedback Linearizable Discretizations of Second Order Mechanical Systems using Retraction Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical systems, in nature, are often described by a set of continuous-time, nonlinear, second-order differential equations (SODEs). This has motivated designs of various control laws implemented on digital controllers, consequently requiring numerical discretization schemes. Feedback linearizability of such sampled systems depends on the discretization scheme or map choice. In this article, we utilize retraction maps and their lifts to construct feedback linearizable discretizations for SODEs, which can be applied to various mechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilization of a quadrotor without a controller based on cascade structure is a challenging problem. Besides, due to the dynamics and the number of underactuation, an energy shaping controller has not been designed in 3D for a quadrotor. This paper presents a novel solution to the potential energy shaping problem for a quadrotor utilizing the Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) approach. For the first time, we extend the solution of PDEs from the 2D case to the full 3D scenario. This advancement seems to be a significant step forward for stabilization of underactuated aerial vehicles without a cascade controller. The results are verified via simulation on a typical quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their apparent benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. These vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise power system safety. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution systems. We derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attack impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we propose a method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the distribution system as a reactive defense approach. We study optimal defense strategies using a non-cooperative sequential game theory approach that is robust to LAAs. The proposed solution takes the potential errors in the attack localization into account. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the distribution network result in the highest detrimental impact on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Autonomous, Self-driving Multi-Step Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks by closed-loop, autonomous experimentation which enables accelerated optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in automated process with minimal human intervention. In this work, we develop SemiEpi, a self-driving automation platform capable of executing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth with multi-steps, continuous in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard hardware, homemade software, curve fitting, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi operates autonomously, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes to achieve optimal outcomes. The platform actively learns from previous experimental results, identifying favorable conditions and proposing new experiments to achieve the desired results. We standardize and optimize growth for InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of ML-guided multi-step growth. A temperature calibration was implemented to get the initial growth condition, and fine control of the process was executed using ML. Leveraging RHEED movies acquired during the growth, SemiEpi successfully identified and optimized a novel route for multi-step heterostructure growth. This work demonstrates the capabilities of closed-loop, ML-guided systems in addressing challenges in multi-step growth for any device. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Our strategy facilitates the development of a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>

      <title>RL-ADN: A High-Performance Deep Reinforcement Learning Environment for Optimal Energy Storage Systems Dispatch in Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents a promising avenue for optimizing Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) dispatch in distribution networks. This paper introduces RL-ADN, an innovative open-source library specifically designed for solving the optimal ESSs dispatch in active distribution networks. RL-ADN offers unparalleled flexibility in modeling distribution networks, and ESSs, accommodating a wide range of research goals. A standout feature of RL-ADN is its data augmentation module, based on Gaussian Mixture Model and Copula (GMC) functions, which elevates the performance ceiling of DRL agents. Additionally, RL-ADN incorporates the Laurent power flow solver, significantly reducing the computational burden of power flow calculations during training without sacrificing accuracy. The effectiveness of RL-ADN is demonstrated using in different sizes of distribution networks, showing marked performance improvements in the adaptability of DRL algorithms for ESS dispatch tasks. This enhancement is particularly beneficial from the increased diversity of training scenarios. Furthermore, RL-ADN achieves a tenfold increase in computational efficiency during training, making it highly suitable for large-scale network applications. The library sets a new benchmark in DRL-based ESSs dispatch in distribution networks and it is poised to advance DRL applications in distribution network operations significantly. RL-ADN is available at: https://github.com/ShengrenHou/RL-ADN and https://github.com/distributionnetworksTUDelft/RL-ADN.</description>
