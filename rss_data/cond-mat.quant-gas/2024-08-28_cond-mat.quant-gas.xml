      <title>Controlling few-body reaction pathways using a Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaining control over chemical reactions on the quantum level is a central goal of the modern field of cold and ultracold chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination process across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the control of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that while the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body recombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains unchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction processes. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control schemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths.</description>

      <title>Hartree-Fock approximation for non-Coulomb interactions in three and two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the Hartree-Fock approximation for an electron system. The interaction between particles is modeled by a non-Coulombian potential. We analyzed both the three-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. We obtained accurate analytical results for the particle energy, the particle velocity, the ground state energy of the system as well as the momentum dependent density of states. The previous classical results for the Coulombian case were reobtained as particular cases.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves emerge when the system is perturbed from its ground state in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). These waves can interact nonlinearly, leading to turbulent cascades. In the present work, the turbulence of random weakly nonlinear Bogoliubov waves on the background of a uniform condensate is considered theoretically, within the Wave Turbulence approach, and numerically, via numerical simulations of the 3-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii model and the associated wave-kinetic equations. A new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum is found for the short Bogoliubov waves. An exact prefactor constant was found for the previously known Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum of long (acoustic) Bogoliubov waves. The results are used to explain the BEC equation of state experimentally obtained in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new settings for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Galilei covariance of the theory of Thouless pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Thouless theory of quantum pumps establishes the conditions for quantized particle transport per cycle, and determines its value. When describing the pump from a moving reference frame, transported and existing charges transform, though not independently. This transformation is inherent to Galilean space and time, but it is underpinned by a transformation of vector bundles. Different formalisms can be used to describe this transformation, including one based on Bloch theory. Depending on the chosen formalism, the two types of charges will be realized as indices of either the same or different kinds. Finally, we apply the bulk-edge correspondence principle, so as to implement the transformation law within B\"uttiker's scattering theory of quantum pumps.</description>

      <title>Exact Polaron-Polaron interactions in a Quantum Hall Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for effective polaron-polaron interactions between heavy impurities, mediated by a sea of non-interacting light fermions in the quantum Hall regime with highly degenerate Landau levels. For weak attraction between impurities and fermions, where only the manifold of lowest Landau levels is relevant, we obtain an analytical expression of mediated polaron-polaorn interactions. Remarkably, polaron interactions are exactly zero when fermions in lowest Landau levels outnumber heavy impurities. For strong attraction, different manifolds of higher Landau levels come into play and we derive a set of equations that can be used to numerically solve the mediated polaron interaction potential. We find that the potential vanishes when the distance R between impurities is larger than the magnetic length, but strongly diverges at short range following a Coulomb form -1/R. Our exact results of polaron-polaron interactions might be examined in cold-atom setups, where a system of Fermi polarons in the quantum Hall regime is realized with synthetic gauge field or under fast rotation. Our predictions could also be useful to understand the effective interaction between exciton-polarons in electron-doped semiconductors under strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Polaronic neutron in dilute alpha matter: A $p$-wave Bose polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate quasiparticle properties of a neutron immersed in an alpha condensate, which is one of the possible states of dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The resonant $p$-wave neutron-alpha scattering, which plays a crucial role in forming halo nuclei, is considered. This system is similar to a Bose polaron near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance that can be realized in cold-atomic experiments. Calculating the low-momentum self-energy within the field-theoretical approach, we give an analytical formula for the effective mass of a polaronic neutron as a function of alpha condensation density. Two adjacent neutrons in a medium, each of which behaves like a stable polaron having an enhanced effective mass, can form a bound dineutron, with the help of $^1S_0$ neutron-neutron attraction. This is in contrast to the case of the vacuum, where a dineutron is known to be unbound. Moreover, adding an impurity-like neutron to symmetric nuclear matter can be regarded as a perturbation accompanied by an explicit breaking of Wigner's $ SU \left( 4 \right) $ symmetry. The relationship between the polaron energy and the Wigner term in nuclear mass formulas is discussed in the low-density limit. Our result would be useful for understanding many-body physics in astrophysical environments as well as the formation of multi-nucleon clusters in neutron-halo nuclei.</description>

      <title>A dissipation-induced superradiant transition in a strontium cavity-QED system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), emitters and a resonator are coupled together to enable precise studies of quantum light-matter interactions. Over the past few decades, this has led to a variety of quantum technologies such as more precise inertial sensors, clocks, memories, controllable qubits, and quantum simulators. Furthermore, the intrinsically dissipative nature of cavity QED platforms makes them a natural testbed for exploring driven-dissipative phenomena in open quantum systems as well as equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions in quantum optics. One such model, the so-called cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, concerns the behavior of coherently driven emitters in the presence of collective dissipation (superradiance). Despite tremendous interest, this model has yet to be realized in a clean experimental system. Here we provide an observation of the continuous superradiant phase transition predicted in the CRF model using an ensemble of ultracold $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse optical cavity on a long-lived optical transition. Below a critical drive, atoms quickly reach a steady state determined by the self-balancing of the drive and the collective dissipation. The steady state possesses a macroscopic dipole moment and corresponds to a superradiant phase. Above a critical drive strength, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations until other decoherence processes kick in. In fact, our platform also allows us to witness the change of this phase transition from second to first order induced by single-particle spontaneous emission, which pushes the system towards a different steady state. Our observations are a first step towards finer control of driven-dissipative systems, which have been predicted to generate quantum states that can be harnessed for quantum information processing and in particular quantum sensing.</description>
