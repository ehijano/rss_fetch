      <title>Effective Lewis number and burning speed for flames propagating in small-scale spatio-temporal periodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagation of premixed flames having thick reaction zones in rapidly-varying, small-scale, zero-mean, spatio-temporal periodic flows is considered. Techniques of large activation energy asymptotics and homogenization theory are used to determine the effective Lewis number $Le_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and the effective burning speed ratio $S_T/S_L$, which are influenced by the flow through flow-enhanced diffusion. As the flow Peclet number $Pe$ becomes large, the effective fuel and thermal diffusivities behave respectively like $(PeLe)^\sigma$ and $Pe^\sigma$, where $Le$ is the Lewis number and $\sigma\leq 2$ is a constant that depends on the flow and the flame-propagation direction. The maximal value $\sigma=2$ is achieved for steady, unidirectional, spatially periodic shear flows, while for steady 2D square vortices, we have $\sigma=1/2$. In general, the constant $\sigma$ is determined by solving a linear partial differential equation. The scaling laws for the diffusion coefficients lead to corresponding scaling laws for the effective Lewis number and the effective burning speed ratio of the form $Le_{\mathrm{eff}}\simeq Le^{1-\sigma}$ and $S_T/S_L\sim (Pe/Le)^{\sigma/2}$. Effects of thermal expansion and volumetric heat loss on the flame are also briefly discussed. In particular, it is shown that the quenching limit is enlarged by a factor $1/Le^\sigma$ for $Le&lt;1$ and diminished by the same factor for $Le&gt;1$, due to the flow-enhanced diffusion. Potential implications of the results for turbulent combustion are discussed. A special emphasis is placed on the dependence of the flame on $Le$ in high-intensity, small-scale flows. This dependence is intimately linked to flow-induced diffusion, rather than to the traditional molecular diffusion coupled with curvature effects. The effective Lewis number may also explain why turbulence aids ignition in $Le&gt;1$ mixtures but hinders it in $Le&lt;1$ mixtures.</description>

      <title>Turbojet Module Sizing for Integration with Turbine-Based Combined Cycle Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) vehicle is studied that relies on a scramjet engine for high-speed flight but requires a turbojet module to accelerate it to a high supersonic handover Mach number. The challenge is to scale a given turbojet engine (TJE) core (compressor, burner, turbine) to a particular value of the air mass flow rate such that the desired thrust at the handover point is achieved. To this end, a model for the engine core is integrated with a supersonic intake model that is designed to supply the required mass flow rate, and a nozzle model that is expected to deliver the desired thrust. Both the TJE intake and nozzle are constrained by the design choices made for the DMSJ module, and the TJE core is itself constrained by the volume available from the TBCC vehicle sizing for hypersonic flight. The TJE module is sized by scaling the engine core with matching intake and nozzle designs in an iterative manner until the process converges to a solution with acceptable thrust satisfying all the system constraints. The task turns out to be non-trivial due to the scarcity of steady operating points for the engine core at high speeds, due to possible mismatch between the mass flow rate demanded by the compressor and that delivered by the supersonic intake, and due to the difficulty in adapting a DMSJ-style single-expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) to adequately expand the turbojet exhaust flow.</description>

      <title>JAX-based differentiable fluid dynamics on GPU and end-to-end optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project aims to advance differentiable fluid dynamics for hypersonic coupled flow over porous media, demonstrating the potential of automatic differentiation (AD)-based optimization for end-to-end solutions. Leveraging AD efficiently handles high-dimensional optimization problems, offering a flexible alternative to traditional methods. We utilized JAX-Fluids, a newly developed solver based on the JAX framework, which combines autograd and TensorFlow's XLA. Compiled on a HAWK-AI node with NVIDIA A100 GPU, JAX-Fluids showed computational performance comparable to other high-order codes like FLEXI. Validation with a compressible turbulent channel flow DNS case showed excellent agreement, and a new boundary condition for modeling porous media was successfully tested on a laminar boundary layer case. Future steps in our research are anticipated.</description>

      <title>Implementation of two-dimensional selective acoustic tweezers merely using four straight interdigitated transducers:a numerical proof of concept of radiation field synthesis by pulsed acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective acoustic tweezers can focus the acoustic radiation force on a single particle to manipulate it without affecting its neighbors. This has long required highly complex hardware. In this numerical study, we show that pulsed acoustic waves can be used for the selective manipulation of particles using only two pairs of orthogonal transducers. While these tweezers are well-known for their ability to manipulate arrays of particles, we show that selectivity can be achieved by using sequences of acoustic pulses to iteratively construct a combined acoustic potential focused only on the target particle.</description>

      <title>Momentum and kinetic energy transport in supersonic particle-laden turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we conduct direct numerical simulations of two-way force-coupled particle-laden compressible turbulent boundary layers at the free-stream Mach number of 2.0 for the purpose of examining the effects of particles on the transport of momentum and kinetic energy. By analyzing turbulent databases with various particle Stokes numbers and mass loadings, we observe that the presence of particles suppresses turbulent fluctuations and can even laminarize flow under high mass loading conditions. This is reflected by the wider and more coherent near-wall velocity streaks, reduced Reynolds stresses, and diminished contributions to skin friction and turbulent kinetic energy production. Additionally, the particle feedback force becomes more dominant in turbulent production near the wall and at small scales as mass loadings increase, which is found to be caused by the residual velocity fluctuations from particles swept down from the outer region. Furthermore, we identify that particle dissipation, resulting from the relative velocity between the fluid and particles, accounts for less than 1% of mean kinetic energy viscous dissipation and less than 10% of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation in the case with the highest mass loading. This suggests a modest impact on the internal energy variation of the fluid if two-way heat coupling is introduced. The elevated mean temperature is found in the near-wall region and is ascribed to the influence of the particle feedback force and reduced turbulent diffusion in high mass loading cases.</description>

      <title>Compressible and immiscible fluids with arbitrary density ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the water-air system, the density ratio is as high as about 1000; no model can fully tackle such a high density ratio system. Here, we present an alternative theory for the density evolution equations in computational fluid dynamics, differing from the concept of Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. Our derivation is built upon the physical principle of energy minimization from the aspect of thermodynamics. The present results are consistent with Landau's theory of sound speed, and, most importantly, provide a generalization of Bernoulli's principle for energy conservation. The present model can be applied for immiscible fluids with arbitrary density ratios, thereby, opening a new window for computational fluid dynamics both for compressible and incompressible fluids.</description>

      <title>A Python-based flow solver for numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method on single GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation for running three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid-structure interaction problems on single GPUs, based on Nvidia CUDA through Numba and Python. The incompressible flow around moving bodies is solved in this framework through an implementation of the Immersed Boundary Method tailored for the GPU, where different GPU grid architectures are exploited to optimize the overall performance. By targeting a single-GPU, we avoid GPU-CPU and GPU-GPU communication bottlenecks, since all the simulation data is always in the global memory of the GPU. We provide details about the numerical methodology, the implementation of the algorithm in the GPU and the memory management, critical in single-GPU implementations. Additionally, we verify the results comparing with our analogous CPU-based parallel solver and assess satisfactorily the efficiency of the code in terms of the relative computing time of the different operations and the scaling of the CPU code compared to a single GPU case. Overall, our tests show that the single-GPU code is between 34 to 54 times faster than the CPU solver in peak performance (96-128 CPU cores). This speedup mainly comes from the change in the method of solution of the linear systems of equations, while the speedup in sections of the algorithm that are equivalent in the CPU and GPU implementations is more modest (i.e., $\times 1.6-3$ speedup in the computation of the non-linear terms). Finally, we showcase the performance of this new GPU implementation in two applications of interest, one for external flows (i.e., bioinspired aerodynamics) and one for internal flows (i.e., cardiovascular flows), demonstrating the strong scaling of the code in two different GPU cards (hardware).%\red{for both single and double precision.}</description>

      <title>Data-driven methods for flow and transport in porous media: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examined the current advancements in data-driven methods for analyzing flow and transport in porous media, which has various applications in energy, chemical engineering, environmental science, and beyond. Although there has been progress in recent years, the challenges of current experimental and high-fidelity numerical simulations, such as high computational costs and difficulties in accurately representing complex, heterogeneous structures, can still potentially be addressed by state-of-the-art data-driven methods. We analyzed the synergistic potential of these methods, addressed their limitations, and suggested how they can be effectively integrated to improve both the fidelity and efficiency of current research. A discussion on future research directions in this field was conducted, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts that combine domain expertise in physics and advanced computationald and data-driven methodologies.</description>

      <title>Neural Differentiable Modeling with Diffusion-Based Super-resolution for Two-Dimensional Spatiotemporal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating spatiotemporal turbulence with high fidelity remains a cornerstone challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to its intricate multiscale nature and prohibitive computational demands. Traditional approaches typically employ closure models, which attempt to represent small-scale features in an unresolved manner. However, these methods often sacrifice accuracy and lose high-frequency/wavenumber information, especially in scenarios involving complex flow physics. In this paper, we introduce an innovative neural differentiable modeling framework designed to enhance the predictability and efficiency of spatiotemporal turbulence simulations. Our approach features differentiable hybrid modeling techniques that seamlessly integrate deep neural networks with numerical PDE solvers within a differentiable programming framework, synergizing deep learning with physics-based CFD modeling. Specifically, a hybrid differentiable neural solver is constructed on a coarser grid to capture large-scale turbulent phenomena, followed by the application of a Bayesian conditional diffusion model that generates small-scale turbulence conditioned on large-scale flow predictions. Two innovative hybrid architecture designs are studied, and their performance is evaluated through comparative analysis against conventional large eddy simulation techniques with physics-based subgrid-scale closures and purely data-driven neural solvers. The findings underscore the potential of the neural differentiable modeling framework to significantly enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of turbulence simulations. This study not only demonstrates the efficacy of merging deep learning with physics-based numerical solvers but also sets a new precedent for advanced CFD modeling techniques, highlighting the transformative impact of differentiable programming in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>A model for the constant-density boundary layer surrounding fire whirls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the steady axisymmetric structure of the cold boundary-layer flow surrounding fire whirls developing over localized fuel sources lying on a horizontal surface. The inviscid swirling motion found outside the boundary layer, driven by the entrainment of the buoyant turbulent plume of hot combustion products that develops above the fire, is described by an irrotational solution, obtained by combining Taylor's self-similar solution for the motion in the axial plane with the azimuthal motion induced by a line vortex of circulation $2 \pi \Gamma$. The development of the boundary layer from a prescribed radial location is determined by numerical integration for different swirl levels, measured by the value of the radial-to-azimuthal velocity ratio $\sigma$ at the initial radial location. As in the case $\sigma=0$, treated in the seminal boundary-layer analysis of Burggraf et al. (Phys. Fluids, 1971), the pressure gradient associated with the centripetal acceleration of the inviscid flow is seen to generate a pronounced radial inflow. Specific attention is given to the terminal shape of the boundary-layer velocity near the axis, which displays a three-layered structure that is described by matched asymptotic expansions. The resulting composite expansion, dependent on the level of ambient swirl through the parameter $\sigma$, is employed as boundary condition to describe the deflection of the boundary-layer flow near the axis to form a vertical swirl jet. Numerical solutions of the resulting non-slender collision region for different values of $\sigma$ are presented both for inviscid flow and for viscous flow with moderately large values of the controlling Reynolds number $\Gamma/\nu$. The velocity description provided is useful in mathematical formulations of localized fire-whirl flows, providing consistent boundary conditions accounting for the ambient swirl level.</description>

      <title>Stokes flows in a two-dimensional bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow network model is an established approach to approximate pressure-flow relationships in a bifurcating network, and has been widely used in many contexts. Existing models typically assume unidirectional flow and exploit Poiseuille's law, and thus neglect the impact of bifurcation geometry and finite-sized objects on the flow. We determine the impact of bifurcation geometry and objects by computing Stokes flows in a two-dimensional (2D) bifurcation using the LARS (Lightning-AAA Rational Stokes) algorithm, a novel mesh-free algorithm for solving 2D Stokes flow problems utilising an applied complex analysis approach based on rational approximation of the Goursat functions. We compute the flow conductances of bifurcations with different channel widths, bifurcation angles, curved boundary geometries, and fixed circular objects. We quantify the difference between the computed conductances and their Poiseuille's law approximations to demonstrate the importance of incorporating detailed bifurcation geometry into existing flow network models. We parameterise the flow conductances of 2D bifurcation as functions of the dimensionless parameters of bifurcation geometry and a fixed object using a machine learning approach, which is simple to use and provides more accurate approximations than Poiseuille's law. Finally, the details of the 2D Stokes flows in bifurcations are presented.</description>

      <title>Thermal explosion characteristics of a gelled hypergolic droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a sphere of one reactant is placed in the medium of another reactant with which it is hypergolic, a chemical reaction (modeled here as a zeroth-order one-step irreversible Arrhenius reaction) occurs at the common interface of the two reactants, and the heat generated at the interface then is transmitted away from it by thermal conduction. Depending on the nature of the problem, the system may approach an explosive mode, or it may settle into a steady-state mode. The critical condition defining the transition between these two states is determined analytically. In particular, explicit formulas for the ignition delay time for the explosive mode are provided for two limits, one in which an appropriately defined Damk\"ohler number is large and the other in which it is closer to the critical conditions. This is accomplished here by deriving and solving an integral equation for the time evolution of the interface temperature, employing activation-energy asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical computations employing detailed chemistry are used to characterize the different combustion modes emerging in mixing layers separating nitrogen-diluted counterflowing planar streams of hydrogen and oxygen. Attention is focused on high degrees of dilution, resulting in near-limit flames, with peak temperatures close to the crossover temperature. A bifurcation diagram is presented in a plane, having the stoichiometric mixture fraction and normalized strain rate as coordinates, that identifies six different combustion regimes involving four different flame types, namely, diffusion-flame sheets, advancing and retreating edge flames, multiple flame tubes, and single isolated flame tubes. Multiple-tube flame configurations vary from small, round, widely separated flame strings at high strain rates to wide, flat, densely packed flame strips, with narrow flame-free gaps between them, at lower strain rates, and they are steady and stable in various arrays over a continuum of tube-separation distances. The observed flame behavior exhibits hysteresis in a certain range of parameters, with the structure that is established depending on the ignition mechanism, as it also does at high strain rates, and a continuum of different stable steady-state flame configurations exists, each accessed from a different initial condition.</description>

      <title>Onset of spontaneous beating and whirling in the follower force model of an active filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the onset of spontaneous dynamics in the follower force model of an active filament, wherein a slender elastic filament in a viscous liquid is clamped normal to a wall at one end and subjected to a tangential compressive force at the other. Clarke, Hwang and Keaveny (Phys. Rev. Fluids, to appear) have recently conducted a thorough investigation of this model using methods of computational dynamical systems; inter alia, they show that the filament first loses stability via a supercritical double-Hopf bifurcation, with periodic 'planar-beating' states (unstable) and 'whirling' states (stable) simultaneously emerging at the critical follower-force value. We complement their numerical study by carrying out a weakly nonlinear analysis close to this unconventional bifurcation, using the method of multiple scales. The main outcome is an 'amplitude equation' governing the slow modulation of small-magnitude oscillations of the filament in that regime. Analysis of this reduced-order model provides insights into the onset of spontaneous dynamics, including the creation of the nonlinear whirling states from particular superpositions of linear planar-beating modes as well as the selection of whirling over planar beating in three-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient dimension-by-dimension finite-volume method which solves the adiabatic magnetohydrodynamics equations at high discretization order, using the constrained-transport approach on Cartesian grids. Results are presented up to tenth order of accuracy. This method requires only one reconstructed value per face for each computational cell. A passage through high-order point values leads to a modest growth of computational cost with increasing discretization order. At a given resolution, these high-order schemes present significantly less numerical dissipation than commonly employed lower-order approaches. Thus, results of comparable accuracy are achievable at a substantially coarser resolution, yielding overall performance gains. We also present a way to include physical dissipative terms: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity and cooling functions, respecting the finite-volume and constrained-transport frameworks.</description>
