      <title>The structure of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of superfluous solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space implies that not all solutions with uniformly locally bounded energy satisfy a useful local pressure expansion. We prove that every weak solution in a parabolic uniformly local $L^2$ class can be obtained as a transgalilean transformation of a solution satisfying the local pressure expansion in a distributional sense. This gives a powerful representation theorem for a large class of solutions. We use this structure to obtain a sufficient condition for the local pressure expansion.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions in $W_0^{1,\infty}(\Omega;\mathbb R^n)$ in the minimal dimension of $\textrm{span }E$ for the following problem: \begin{equation*} P(D)u\in E \textrm{ a.e. in }\Omega, \end{equation*} where $P(D)= D$ or $D+D^{\top}$, and $E\subseteq \mathbb R^{n\times n}$ is a given set. We conclude this paper with some properties of real symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Almost Periodic Solutions of The Cubic Defocusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Cauchy problem for the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with almost periodic initial data. We prove that for small analytic quasiperiodic initial data satisfying Diophantine frequency conditions, the Cauchy problem admits a solution that is almost periodic in both space and time, and that this solution is unique among solutions locally bounded in a suitable sense. The analysis combines direct and inverse spectral theory.
  In the inverse spectral theory part, we prove existence, almost periodicity, and uniqueness for solutions with initial data whose associated Dirac operator has purely a.c.\ spectrum that is not too thin. This resolves novel challenges presented by the NLS hierarchy, such as an additional degree of freedom and an additional commuting flow.
  In the direct spectral theory part, for Dirac operators with small analytic quasiperiodic potentials with Diophantine frequency conditions, we prove pure a.c.\ spectrum, exponentially decaying spectral gaps, and spectral thickness conditions (homogeneity and Craig-type conditions).</description>

      <title>Existence and regularity of weak solutions for mixed local and nonlocal semilinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence, multiplicity and regularity results of weak solutions for the Dirichlet problem of a semi-linear elliptic equation driven by the mixture of the usual Laplacian and fractional Laplacian
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{%
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u + (-\Delta)^{s} u+ a(x)\ u =f(x,u) &amp; \hbox{in $\Omega$,}
  u=0 &amp; \hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\Omega$}
  \end{array}%
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $s \in (0,1)$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a bounded domain, the coefficient $a$ is a function of $x$ and the subcritical nonlinearity $f(x,u)$ has superlinear growth at zero and infinity.
  We show the existence of a non-trivial weak solution by Linking Theorem and Mountain Pass Theorem respectively for $\lambda_{1} \leqslant 0$ and $\lambda_{1} &gt; 0$, where $\lambda_{1}$ denotes the first eigenvalue of $-\Delta + (-\Delta)^{s} +a(x)$.
  In particular, adding a symmetric condition to $f$, we obtain infinitely many solutions via Fountain Theorem.
  Moreover, for the regularity part, we first prove the $L^{\infty}$-boundedness of weak solutions and then establish up to $C^{2, \alpha}$-regularity up to boundary.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness for the periodic fractional cubic NLS in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the defocusing periodic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
  $$ i \partial_t u +\left(-\Delta\right)^{\alpha}u=-\lvert u \rvert ^2 u, $$ where $\frac{1}{2}&lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ and the operator $(-\Delta)^\alpha$ is the fractional Laplacian with symbol $\lvert k \rvert ^{2\alpha}$. We establish global well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s\geq \frac{1-\alpha}{2}$ and we conjecture this threshold to be sharp as it corresponds to the pseudo-Galilean symmetry exponent. Our proof uses the $I$-method to control the $H^s(\mathbb{T})$-norm of solutions with infinite energy initial data. A key component of our approach is a set of improved long-time linear and bilinear Strichartz estimates on the rescaled torus, which allow us to exploit the subcritical nature of the equation.</description>

      <title>Large-Amplitude Steady Rotational Solitary Waves Under Normal Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers large-amplitude, two-dimensional and rotational solitary waves propagating under a normal electric field. We present a new model for nonlinear systems with a free surface, governed by Euler and electric potential equations. Unlike previous works, our work allows internal stagnation points and overhanging profiles. We prove the existence of a continuous curve of large-amplitude solitary wave solutions using analytic bifurcation theory and conformal mapping. Furthermore, to establish compactness, more intricate nodal analysis and Schauder estimates are performed, yielding the well-behaved structure of the curve. Along this curve, either (i) an extreme wave forms and the stagnation point occurs, (ii) a singularity emerges on the free surface, or (iii) the dimensionless wave speed becomes unbounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the nonlocal $p$-biharmonic evolution equation with the Dirichlet boundary condition that arises in image processing and data analysis. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the nonlocal equation and discuss the large time behavior of the solution. By appropriately rescaling the nonlocal kernel, we further show that the solution converges to the solution of the classical $p$-biharmonic equation with the Dirichlet boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problems for time-space fractional coupled chemotaxis-fluid equations in Besov-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problems for the time-space fractional coupled chemotaxis-fluid equations, which is a generalized form of the coupled chemotaxis-fluid equations studied in \cite{M.H. Yang}. In contrast to \cite{M.H. Yang}, the solution operator of the system does not satisfy the semigroup effect, which makes the approach of \cite{M.H. Yang} inapplicable. Based on the theory of harmonic analysis, using techniques such as real interpolation, embedding in Besov-Morrey spaces, the multiplier theorem, and the Hardy-Littelwood inequality in Morrey spaces, we establish global existence. As an application, we analysis the asymptotic behavior of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Core detection via Ricci curvature flows on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Ricci curvature is crucial as it geometrically quantifies network structure. It pinpoints bottlenecks via negative curvature, identifies cohesive communities with positive curvature, and highlights robust hubs. This guides network analysis, resilience assessment, flow optimization, and effective algorithm design.
  In this paper, we derived upper and lower bounds for the weights along several kinds of discrete Ricci curvature flows. As an application, we utilized discrete Ricci curvature flows to detect the core subgraph of a finite undirected graph. The novelty of this work has two aspects. Firstly, along the Ricci curvature flow, the bounds for weights determine the minimum number of iterations required to ensure weights remain between two prescribed positive constants. In particular, for any fixed graph, we conclude weights can not overflow and can not be treated as zero, as long as the iteration does not exceed a certain number of times; Secondly, it demonstrates that our Ricci curvature flow method for identifying core subgraphs outperforms prior approaches, such as page rank, degree centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. The codes for our algorithms are available at https://github.com/12tangze12/core-detection-via-Ricci-flow.</description>

      <title>Parabolic-elliptic and indirect-direct simplifications in chemotaxis systems driven by indirect signalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under relevant biological situations of the signalling process on a much faster time scale compared to the species diffusion and all interactions, we study two singular limits corresponding to $\varepsilon\to 0^+$ with a fixed $\tau&gt;0$, and $(\varepsilon,\tau)\to (0^+,0^+)$ arising in the following indirect signalling chemotaxis system with no-flux accross the boundary \begin{align*} \left\{\begin{array}{lllllll} \partial_t n=\Delta n-\nabla\cdot(n\nabla c)&amp;\text{in }\Omega\times(0,\infty),\\ \varepsilon\partial_t c=\Delta c-c+w&amp;\text{in }\Omega\times(0,\infty),\\ \varepsilon\partial_t w=\tau\Delta w-w+n&amp;\text{in }\Omega\times(0,\infty),\\ (n,c,w)_{t=0}=(n_0,c_0,w_0)&amp;\text{on }\Omega, \end{array}\right. \end{align*} up to the critical dimension $N=4$, called parabolic-elliptic and indirect-direct simplifications, respectively. We provide rigorous analysis for these simplifications, including passage to the limits, convergence rate estimates with the initial layer effect, and the convergence to critical manifolds.</description>

      <title>Dissipation concentration in two-dimensional fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dissipation measure arising in the inviscid limit of two-dimensional incompressible fluids. For Leray-Hopf solutions it is proved that the dissipation is Lebesgue in time and, for almost every time, it is absolutely continuous with respect to the defect measure of strong compactness of the solutions. When the initial vorticity is a measure, the dissipation is proved to be absolutely continuous with respect to a suitable "quadratic" space-time vorticity measure. This results into the trivial measure if the initial vorticity has singular part of distinguished sign, or a spatially purely atomic measure if wild oscillations in time are ruled out. In fact, the dynamics at the Kolmogorov scale is the only relevant one, in turn offering new criteria for anomalous dissipation. We provide kinematic examples highlighting the strengths and the limitations of our approach. Quantitative rates, dissipation life-span and steady fluids are also investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence rate in the vanishing viscosity limit for solutions to superquadratic Hamilton--Jacobi equations with state constraints. For every $p&gt;2$, we establish the rate of convergence for nonnegative Lipschitz data vanishing on the boundary to be of order $ \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{1/2}) $ and obtain an improved upper rate of order $ \mathcal{O}\big(\varepsilon^{\frac{p}{2(p-1)}}\big)$ for semiconcave data.</description>

Abstract: An initial boundary value problem for one-dimensional hyperbolic compressible Navier-Stokes equations is investigated. After transforming the system into Lagrangian coordinate, the resulting system possesses a structure with uniform characteristic boundary. By constructing an approximate system with non-characteristic boundary, we get a uniform global smooth solutions and obtain a global solution of the original problem by passing to a limit. Moreover, the global relaxation limit is also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for two-marginal optimal transport with Coulomb cost, the optimal map is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ diffeomorphism outside a closed set of Lebesgue measure zero provided the marginals are $\alpha$-H\"older continuous and bounded away from zero and infinity. Excluding a set of measure zero is necessary as optimal maps for the Coulomb cost have long been known to exhibit jump singularities across codimension $1$ surfaces (even for smooth marginals on convex domains).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with evolution problem for the $1$-Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions on a bounded open set $\Omega$ of $\R^N$. We prove existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for data in $L^2(\Omega)$ by mean of the theory of maximal monotone operator. We also see that if the flux on the boundary is~$1$ (that is, the maximum possible) then these strong solutions can be seen as the large solutions introduced in \cite{MP}. We give explicit examples of solutions.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates of Landau-de Gennes minimizers in the vanishing elasticity limit with line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Landau-de Gennes functional modeling nematic liquid crystals in dimension three, we prove that, if the energy is bounded by $C(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+1)$, then the sequence of minimizers $\{\mathbf{Q}_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon\in (0,1)}$ is relatively compact in $W_{\operatorname{loc}}^{1,p}$ for every $1&lt;p&lt;2$. This extends the classical compactness theorem of Bourgain-Br\'{e}zis-Mironescu [Publ. Math., IH\'{E}S, 99:1-115, 2004] for complex Ginzburg-Landau minimizers to the $\mathbb R\mathbf P^2$-valued Landau-de Gennes setting. Moreover, We obtain local bounds on the integral of the bulk energy potential that are uniform in $ \varepsilon $, improving the estimate that follows directly from the assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel front tracking scheme for scalar conservation laws with spatially heterogeneous, uniformly convex flux and demonstrate that the approximations converge to the entropy solution.

      <title>A Lane-Emden system of free boundary type: existence, uniqueness and monotonicity of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Hamiltonian system of free boundary type, showing first uniform bounds and existence of solutions and of the free boundary. Then, for any smooth and bounded domain, we prove uniqueness of positive solutions in a suitable interval and show that the associated energies and boundary values have a monotonic behavior. Some consequences are discussed about the parametrization of the unbounded Rabinowitz continuum for a class of superlinear strongly coupled elliptic systems.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the global attractor for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on channel-like domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularity of the global attractor of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows on two-dimensional domains is considered. It is assumed that domain $\Omega$ is a channel-like domain, i.e an arbitrary bounded or unbounded domain, at first without any regularity assumption on its boundary, with the only assumption that the Poincar\'e inequality holds on it. The phase space $H$ for the system is the usual closure in the $L^2(\Omega)^2$ norm of the space of smooth divergent-free vector-fields with compact support in $\Omega.$ The corresponding space obtained as the closure with respect to the $H^1(\Omega)^2$ norm is denoted by $V.$ The forcing term is assumed to belong to dual space $V'.$ It is known in this case that the global attractor exists in the phase space $H.$ It is shown in this work that the global attractor is also a compact set in $V$, and that due to the regularization effect of the equations, the solutions converge to the attractor in the norm of $V$, uniformly for initial conditions bounded in $H$. Moreover, it is shown that if the forcing term belongs to $D(A^{-s})$, for some $0&lt;s\leq 1/2$, where $A$ is the Stokes operator, then the global attractor is compact in $D(A^{-s+1})$. If the forcing term is in $H,$ corresponding to the limit case $s=0,$ then it is further assumed that the domain is either a uniformly $\Ccal^{1,1}$ smooth domain or a bounded Lipschitz domain in order to obtain that the global attractor is compact in $D(A).$</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the Allen-Cahn equation with dynamic boundary conditions of Cahn-Hilliard type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02021v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problems for partial differential equations coupled with dynamic boundary conditions can be viewed as a type of transmission problem between the bulk and its boundary. For the heat equation and the Allen-Cahn equation, various forms of such problems with dynamic boundary conditions are studied in this paper. In the case of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in the bulk, several models have been proposed in which the boundary equations and conditions differ. Recently, the vanishing surface diffusion limit has been investigated in more than one of these models. In such settings, the resulting dynamic boundary equation typically takes the form of a forward-backward parabolic equation. In this paper, we focus on a different model, in which the Allen-Cahn equation governs the bulk dynamics, while the boundary condition is of Cahn-Hilliard type. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the system, including the well-posedness of the limiting problems and corresponding error estimates for the differences between solutions. These aspects are discussed for three types of limiting systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the least energy solutions to the Choquard equation in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the following planar Choquard equation \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u=\displaystyle\left(\int\limits_{\Omega}\frac{u^{p+1}(y)}{|x-y|^\alpha}dy\right)u^{p},\quad u&gt;0,\ \ &amp;\mbox{in}\ \Omega,
  \quad \ \ u=0, \ \ &amp;\mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$ and $p&gt;1$ is a positive parameter. Unlike the higher-dimensional case, we prove that the least energy solutions $u_{p}$ neither blow up nor vanish, and develop only one peak as $p\to+\infty$ under suitable assumptions on $\Omega$. In contrast, the modified solutions $pu_p$ exhibit blow-up behavior analogous to that observed in higher dimensions. Furthermore, as $\alpha \to 0$, the main results of this paper become consistent with the known conclusions for the corresponding Lane-Emden equation.</description>

      <title>Abstract Formulation of Mean-Field Models and Propagation of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate an abstract framework to study mean-field systems. In contrast to most approaches in the available literature which primarily rely on the analysis of SDEs, ours is based on optimal transport and semigroup theory. This allows for the inclusion of a wider range of mean-field particle systems within a unified structure. This new approach involves: (1) constructing an abstract framework using semigroups and generators; (2) formulating a corresponding mean-field evolution problem, and proving its well-posedness; (3) demonstrating the propagation of chaos for a class of N-particle systems associated with the mean-field model. Our results are readily applicable to various mean-field models. To demonstrate this, we apply our findings to obtain a new result for Levy-type mean-field systems, which encompass the McKean-Vlasov diffusion.</description>

      <title>Sparse Gabor representations of metaplectic operators: controlled exponential decay and Schr\"odinger confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the phase space analysis of Schr\"odinger evolution operators, in this paper we investigate how metaplectic operators are approximately diagonalized along the corresponding symplectic flows by exponentially localized Gabor wave packets. Quantitative bounds for the matrix coefficients arising in the Gabor wave packet decomposition of such operators are established, revealing precise exponential decay rates together with subtler dispersive and spreading phenomena. To this aim, we present several novel results concerning the time-frequency analysis of functions with controlled Gelfand-Shilov regularity, which are of independent interest. As a byproduct, we generalize Vemuri's Gaussian confinement results for the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator in two respects, namely by encompassing general exponential decay rates as well as arbitrary quadratic Schr\"odinger propagators. In particular, we extensively discuss some prominent models such as the harmonic oscillator, the free particle in a constant magnetic field and fractional Fourier transforms.</description>

      <title>Nondegeneracy of bubble solutions to the Choquard equation in two dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following Choquard equation with exponential nonlinearity \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u=\left(\int_{\R^{2}}\frac{e^{u(y)}}{|x-y|^{\alpha}}dy\right)e^{u(x)},\quad \text{~in~}\R^{2}, \end{equation*} where $\alpha\in (0,2)$. Although the classification of solutions to this equation has been established recently, the nondegeneracy of its solutions remains open. Here, we prove the nondegeneracy by combining the integral representation of solutions with the spherical harmonic decomposition. The main result of this paper can be viewed as an extension of the nondegeneracy of solutions for both the planar Liouville equation and the higher-dimensional upper critical Choquard equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Liouville type theorems for the 3D stationary magneto-micropolar fluid equations. Adopting an iterative procedure, taking advantage of the special structure of the equations and using a novel combination of two different interpolation inequalities, we establish Liouville type theorems if the smooth solution satisfies certain growth conditions in terms of $L^p$-norms on the annuli. Compared with the velocity field and the magnetic field, we raise the most relaxed restriction for the angular velocity. More specifically, we allow $L^q$-norm of the angular velocity on the annuli to grow polynomially at any degree. Besides, we also obtain Liouville type theorems for the 3D stationary micropolar fluid equations.</description>

Abstract: We study dynamics of the 4$d$ energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation at the ground state energy. Previously, Duyckaerts and Merle [Geom. Funct. Anal. (2009)] proved that any radial solution with kinetic energy less than that of the ground state either scatters in both time directions or coincides (modulo symmetries) with a heteroclinic orbit, which scatters in one time direction and converges to the ground state in the other. We extend this result to the non-radial setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider equations of nonlinear transport on the circle with regular self interactions appearing in aggregation models and deterministic mean field dynamics. We introduce a random perturbation of such systems through a stochastic orientation preserving flow, which is given as an integrated infinite dimensional periodic Ornstein- Uhlenbeck process with reflection. As our main result we show that the induced stochastic dynamics yields a measure valued Markov process on a class of regular measures. Moreover, we show that this process is strong Feller in the corresponding topology. This is interpreted as a qualitative regularisation by noise phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Geometric post-Lie deformations of post-Lie algebras and regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to derive a class of geometric-type deformations of post-Lie algebras, we first extend the geometrical notions of torsion and curvature for a general bilinear operation on a Lie algebra, then we derive compatibility conditions which will ensure that the post-Lie structure remains preserved. This type of deformation applies in particular to the post-Lie algebra introduced in arXiv:2306.02484v3 in the context of regularity structures theory. We use this deformation to derive a pre-Lie structure for the regularity structures approach given in arXiv:2103.04187v4, which is isomorphic to the post-Lie algebra studied in arXiv:2306.02484v3 at the level of their associated Hopf algebras. In the case of sections of smooth vector bundles of a finite-dimensional manifold, this deformed structure contains also, as a subalgebra, the post-Lie algebra structure introduced in arXiv:1203.4738v3 in the geometrical context of moving frames.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the large-time behaviors of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the 1D torus while being subjected to random perturbation via additive Gaussian noise. It is well-known that under suitable assumptions on the stochastic forcing, the KSE admits a unique invariant probability measure. In this work, we make further progress on the topic of ergodicity by addressing the issue of convergence rate toward equilibrium. In comparison with the previous results, we can prove that the unique invariant probability measure is exponentially attractive and smallness condition of anti-diffusion coefficient is not necessary here. The proof relies on a coupling argument while making use of Lyapunov functions motivated by those of deterministic equations.</description>

      <title>Moment Estimate and Variational Approach for Learning Generalized Diffusion with Non-gradient Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01854v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven learning framework for identifying governing laws of generalized diffusions with non-gradient components. By combining energy dissipation laws with a physically consistent penalty and first-moment evolution, we design a two-stage method to recover the pseudo-potential and rotation in the pointwise orthogonal decomposition of a class of non-gradient drifts in generalized diffusions. Our two-stage method is applied to complex generalized diffusion processes including dissipation-rotation dynamics, rough pseudo-potentials and noisy data. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning physical laws in non-gradient generalized diffusions.</description>

      <title>Warped products, solid hyperbolic fillings, and the identity $D^{1,p} = N^{1,p} + \mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a large class of metric measure spaces $Z$ which satisfy the identity $D^{1,p}(Z) = N^{1,p}(Z) + \mathbb{R}$, i.e.\ any measurable function $u \colon Z \to \mathbb{R}$ with an $L^p$-integrable upper gradient is a constant term away from being $L^p$-integrable. To do so, we construct a family of hyperbolic fillings $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$, $\alpha, \beta \in (0, \infty)$, of a metric measure space $Y$, via a warped product of $Y$ with an exponentially weighted positive real line. We then show that for certain classes of $Y$, the above identity is satisfied for $Z=\mathbb{H}_{\alpha,\beta}(Y)$ when $1\le p\le \beta/\alpha$. We also show that under mild assumptions on $Y$, the warped product $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$ is Gromov hyperbolic as a metric space and the Gromov boundary of $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$ is quasisymmetric to $Y$.</description>

      <title>Flat bands, Dirac cones, and higher-order band crossings in twisted multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>A notion of partial order in the Choose the Leader model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we continue the study of non-chaotic asymptotic correlations in many element systems and discuss the emergence of a new notion of asymptotic correlation -- partial order -- in the Choose the Leader (CL) system. Similarly to the newly defined notion of order, partial order refers to alignment of the elements in the system -- though it allows for deviation from total adherence. Our presented work revolves around the definition of partial order and shows its emergence in the CL model in its original critical scaling. Furthermore, we discuss the propagation of partial order in the CL model and give a quantitative estimate to the convergence to this state. This new notion (as well as that of order) opens the door to exploring old and new (probabilistic) models of biological and societal nature in a more realistic way.</description>

      <title>Min-max theory and Yamabe metrics on conical four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of Yamabe metrics on four-manifolds possessing finitely-many conical points with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-group, using for the first time a min-max scheme in the singular setting. In our variational argument we need to deform continuously regular bubbles into singular ones, while keeping the Yamabe energy sufficiently low. For doing this, we exploit recent positive mass theorems in the conical setting and study how the mass of the conformal blow-up diverges as the blow-up point approaches the singular set.</description>

Abstract: Based on variational methods, we study the spectral problem for the subelliptic $p$-Laplacian arising from smooth H\"ormander vector fields. We derive the smallest eigenvalue, prove its simplicity and isolatedness, establish the positivity of the first eigenfunction and show H\"older regularity of eigenfunctions. Moreover, we determine the best constant for the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e-Friedrichs inequality for H\"ormander vector fields as a byproduct.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present a simpler and alternative proof of the solvability of the regularity problem - that is, the Dirichlet problem with boundary data in $\dot W^{1,p}$ - for uniformly elliptic operators on $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ under a (possibly large) Carleson measure condition. In addition, we slightly expand the class of operators for which the regularity problem is solvable, and establish an analogous result for weighted uniformly elliptic operators on $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d &lt; n - 1$.</description>

      <title>Strong Convergence of Vorticities in the 2D Viscosity Limit on a Bounded Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the vanishing viscosity limit from the Navier-Stokes to Euler equations on domains with boundaries, a main difficulty comes from the mismatch of boundary conditions and, consequently, the possible formation of a boundary layer. Within a purely interior framework, Constantin and Vicol showed that the two-dimensional viscosity limit is justified for any arbitrary but finite time under the assumption that on each compactly contained subset of the domain, the enstrophies are bounded uniformly along the viscosity sequence. Within this framework, we upgrade to local strong convergence of the vorticities under a similar assumption on the $p$-enstrophies, $p&gt;2$. The key novel idea is the analysis of the evolution of the weak convergence defect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following class of weighted Choquard equations
  \begin{align*}
  -\Delta u =\lambda u + \Bigg(\displaystyle\int\limits_\Omega \frac{Q(|y|)F(u(y))}{|x-y|^\mu}dy\Bigg) Q(|x|)f(u) ~~\textrm{in}~~ \Omega~~ \text{and}~~
  u=0~~ \textrm{on}~~ \partial \Omega,
  \end{align*}
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, $\mu \in (0,2)$ and $\lambda &gt;0$ is a parameter. We assume that $f$ is a real valued continuous function satisfying critical exponential growth in the Trudinger-Moser sense, and $F$ is the primitive of $f$. Let $Q$ be a positive real valued continuous weight, which can be singular at zero. Our main goal is to prove the existence of a nontrivial solution for all parameter values except the resonant case, i.e., when $\lambda$ coincides with any of the eigenvalues of the operator $(-\Delta, H^1_0(\Omega))$.</description>

      <title>Non-isothermal diffuse interface model for phase transition and interface evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal diffuse interface model for phase transition and interface evolution involving heat transfer. This model is constructed by integrating concepts from classical irreversible thermodynamics with the energetic variational approach. By making specific assumptions about the kinematics of the temperature, we derive a non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation. Through both asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that in the sharp interface limit, the non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation converges to a two-phase nonlinear Stefan type problem, under a certain scale of the melting/freezing energy. In this regime, the motion of the liquid-solid interface and the temperature interface coincide and are governed by the mean curvature, at least for a short time. The result provides a justification for the classical Stefan problem within a certain physical regime.</description>

      <title>Carleson perturbations of locally Lipschitz elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In one-sided Chord-Arc Domains $\Omega$, we demonstrate that the $A_\infty$-absolute continuity of the elliptic measure with respect to the surface measure remains stable under $L^2$ Carleson perturbations. This stability holds provided that either the elliptic operator $L_0=-\operatorname{div} A_0\nabla$, which is being perturbed, or the perturbed operator $L_1=-\operatorname{div} A_1\nabla$ satisfies the condition $\sup_{X\in \Omega }\operatorname{dist}(X,\partial \Omega)|\nabla A_i(X)| &lt;\infty$ on its coefficients. $L^2$ Carleson perturbations are slightly more general than those previously discussed in the literature.
  The proof hinges on the availability of a comprehensive elliptic theory and a domain $\Omega$ that allows uniform non-tangential access to any point on its boundary. Consequently, while the current theory of $L^2$ Carleson perturbations can be extended to more general contexts, we have chosen not to do so in order to simplify the presentation.</description>

      <title>On the conservation of helicity by weak solutions of the 3D Euler and inviscid MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations of an ideal incompressible fluid conserve the helicity. We introduce a new weak formulation of the vorticity formulation of the Euler equations in which (by implementing the Bony paradifferential calculus) the advection terms are interpreted as paraproducts for weak solutions with low regularity. Using this approach we establish an equation of local helicity balance, which gives a rigorous foundation to the concept of local helicity density and flux at low regularity. We provide a sufficient criterion for helicity conservation which is weaker than many of the existing sufficient criteria for helicity conservation in the literature.
  Subsequently, we prove a sufficient condition for the helicity to be conserved in the zero viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, we establish a relation between the defect measure (which is part of the local helicity balance) and a third-order structure function for solutions of the Euler equations. As a byproduct of the approach introduced in this paper, we also obtain a new sufficient condition for the conservation of magnetic helicity in the inviscid MHD equations, as well as for the kinematic dynamo model.
  Finally, it is known that classical solutions of the ideal (inviscid) MHD equations which have divergence-free initial data will remain divergence-free, but this need not hold for weak solutions. We show that weak solutions of the ideal MHD equations arising as weak-$*$ limits of Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the viscous and resistive MHD equations remain divergence-free in time.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to combine the advantages of the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson JMGT equation as an advanced model in nonlinear acoustics with a frequency domain formulation of the forward and inverse problem of acoustic nonlinearity parameter tomography, enabling the multiplication of information by nonlinearity. Our main result is local uniqueness of the space dependent nonlinearity parameter from boundary measurements, which we achieve by linearized uniqueness with an Implicit Function type perturbation argument in appropriately chosen topologies. Moreover, we shortly dwell on the application of a regularized Newton type method for reconstructing the nonlinearity coefficient, whose convergence can be established by means of the linear uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a functional calculus which allows one to apply functions to the matrix anti-commutator/commutator operator. The calculus is introduced in a straightforward manner if the operators act on symmetric matrices, and it leads to a coordinate-free version of Daleckii--Krein formula. In this sense, the proposed calculus provides symbolic formulae for the derivatives of matrix-valued functions that are explicit and easy to use. We discuss several applications of the newly introduced calculus in continuum mechanics (Hencky logarithmic strain, objective rates, spin tensors, viscoelastic fluids) and in the theory of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Another look at quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with prescribed mass via dual method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the existence of ground state normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation $-\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=h(u)+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N$, under the mass constraint $\int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a,$ where $N\geq2$, $a&gt;0$ is a given mass, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $h$ is a nonlinear reaction term with some suitable conditions. By employing a suitable transformation $u=f(v)$, we reformulate the original problem into the equivalent form $-\Delta v =h(f(v))f'(v)+\lambda f(v)f'(v),\,\, x\in\R^N,$ with prescribed mass $ \int_{\R^N}|f(v)|^2\text{d}x=a. $ To address the challenge posed by the $L^2$-norm $\|f(v)\|^2_2$ not necessarily equaling
  $a$, we introduce a novel stretching mapping: $ v_t(x):=f^{-1}(t^{N/2}f(v(tx))). $ This construction, combined with a dual method and detailed analytical techniques, enables us to establish the following existence results:
  (1)Existence of solutions via constrained minimization using dual methods;
  (2) Existence of ground state normalized solutions under general
  $L^2$-supercritical growth conditions, along with nonexistence results, analyzed via dual methods;
  (3)Existence of normalized solutions under critical growth conditions, treated via dual methods.
  Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy obtained in {\bf(P2)}. Our results extend and refine those of Colin-Jeanjean-Squassina [Nonlinearity 20: 1353-1385, 2010], of Jeanjean-Luo-Wang [J. Differ. Equ. 259: 3894-3928, 2015], of Li-Zou [Pacific J. Math. 322: 99-138, 2023], of Zhang-Li-Wang [Topol. Math. Nonl. Anal. 61: 465-489, 2023] and so on. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of normalized solutions for quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations via the dual method.</description>

      <title>Existence of ground state solutions to Kirchhoff--Choquard system in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following linearly coupled Kirchhoff--Choquard system in $\mathbb{R}^3$: \begin{align*} \begin{cases} -\left(a_1 + b_1\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2\,dx\right)\Delta u + V_1 u = \mu (I_{\alpha} * |u|^p) |u|^{p - 2} u + \lambda v, \ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^3\\ -\left(a_2 + b_2\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla v|^2\,dx\right)\Delta v + V_2 v = \nu (I_{\alpha} * |v|^q) |v|^{q - 2} v + \lambda u,\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^3 \\ u, v \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3),
  \end{cases} \end{align*} where $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, V_1, V_2$, $\lambda$, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are positive constants. The function $I_{\alpha} : \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ denotes the Riesz potential with $\alpha \in (0, 3)$.
  We study the existence of positive ground state solutions under the conditions $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} &lt; p \le q &lt; 3 + \alpha$, or $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} &lt; p &lt; q = 3 + \alpha$, or $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} = p &lt; q &lt; 3 + \alpha$. Assuming suitable conditions on $V_1$, $V_2$, and $\lambda$, we obtain a ground state solution by employing a variational approach based on the Nehari--Pohozaev manifold, inspired by the works of Ueno (Commun. Pure Appl. Anal. 24 (2025)) and Chen--Liu (J. Math. Anal. 473 (2019)).
  In particular, we emphasize that in the upper half critical case $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} &lt; p &lt; q = 3 + \alpha$ and the lower half critical case $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} = p &lt; q &lt; 3 + \alpha$, a ground state solution can still be obtained by taking $\mu$ or $\nu$ sufficiently large to control the energy level of the minimization problem.
  To employ the Nehari--Pohozaev manifold we extend a regularity result to the linearly coupled system, which is essential for the validity of the Pohozaev identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the vanishing elasticity limit for minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes model with finite energy. By adopting a refined blow-up and covering analysis, we establish the optimal $ L^p $ ($ 1&lt;p&lt;+\infty $) convergence of minimizers and achieve the sharp $ L^1 $ convergence rate of the bulk energy term.</description>

      <title>Maps of bounded variation from PI spaces to metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study maps of bounded variation defined on a metric measure space and valued into a metric space. Assuming the source space to satisfy a doubling and Poincar\'e property, we produce a well-behaved relaxation theory via approximation by simple maps. Moreover, several equivalent characterizations are given, including a notion in weak duality with test plans.</description>

      <title>SDEs with supercritical distributional drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $d\geq 2$. In this paper, we investigate the following stochastic differential equation (SDE) in ${\mathbb R}^d$ driven by Brownian motion $$ {\rm d} X_t=b(t,X_t){\rm d} t+\sqrt{2}{\rm d} W_t, $$ where $b$ belongs to the space ${\mathbb L}_T^q \mathbf{H}_p^\alpha$ with $\alpha \in [-1, 0]$ and $p,q\in[2, \infty]$, which is a distribution-valued and divergence-free vector field. In the subcritical case $\frac dp+\frac 2q&lt;1+\alpha$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the integral equation: $$ X_t=X_0+\lim_{n\to\infty}\int^t_0b_n(s,X_s){\rm d} s+\sqrt{2} W_t. $$ Here, $b_n:=b*\phi_n$ represents the mollifying approximation, and the limit is taken in the $L^2$-sense. In the critical and supercritical case $1+\alpha\leq\frac dp+\frac 2q&lt;2+\alpha$, assuming the initial distribution has an $L^2$-density, we show the existence of weak solutions and associated Markov processes. Moreover, under the additional assumption that $b=b_1+b_2+{\rm div} a$, where $b_1\in {\mathbb L}^\infty_T{\mathbf B}^{-1}_{\infty,2}$, $b_2\in {\mathbb L}^2_TL^2$, and $a$ is a bounded antisymmetric matrix-valued function, we establish the convergence of mollifying approximation solutions without the need to subtract a subsequence. To illustrate our results, we provide examples of Gaussian random fields and singular interacting particle systems, including the two-dimensional vortex models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial flows: A gradient flow characterization of adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular method to perform adversarial attacks on neuronal networks is the so-called fast gradient sign method and its iterative variant. In this paper, we interpret this method as an explicit Euler discretization of a differential inclusion, where we also show convergence of the discretization to the associated gradient flow. To do so, we consider the concept of p-curves of maximal slope in the case $p=\infty$. We prove existence of $\infty$-curves of maximum slope and derive an alternative characterization via differential inclusions. Furthermore, we also consider Wasserstein gradient flows for potential energies, where we show that curves in the Wasserstein space can be characterized by a representing measure on the space of curves in the underlying Banach space, which fulfill the differential inclusion. The application of our theory to the finite-dimensional setting is twofold: On the one hand, we show that a whole class of normalized gradient descent methods (in particular signed gradient descent) converge, up to subsequences, to the flow, when sending the step size to zero. On the other hand, in the distributional setting, we show that the inner optimization task of adversarial training objective can be characterized via $\infty$-curves of maximum slope on an appropriate optimal transport space.</description>

      <title>Deformation of the heat kernel and the Brownian motion from the perspective of the Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</description>

      <title>Harmonic extension technique: probabilistic and analytic perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a path of the reflected Brownian motion in the half-plane $\{y \ge 0\}$, and erase its part contained in the interior $\{y &gt; 0\}$. What is left is, in an appropriate sense, a path of a jump-type stochastic process on the line $\{y = 0\}$ -- the boundary trace of the reflected Brownian motion. It is well known that this process is in fact the 1-stable L\'evy process, also known as the Cauchy process.
  The PDE interpretation of the above fact is the following. Consider a bounded harmonic function $u$ in the half-plane $\{y &gt; 0\}$, with sufficiently smooth boundary values $f$. Let $g$ denote the normal derivative of $u$ at the boundary. The mapping $f \mapsto g$ is known as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, and it is again well known that this operator coincides with the square root of the 1-D Laplace operator $-\Delta$. Thus, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator coincides with the generator of the boundary trace process.
  Molchanov and Ostrovskii proved that isotropic stable L\'evy processes are boundary traces of appropriate diffusions in half-spaces. Caffarelli and Silvestre gave a PDE counterpart of this result: the fractional Laplace operator is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for an appropriate second-order elliptic equation in the half-space. Again, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator turns out to be the generator of the boundary trace process.
  During my talk I will discuss boundary trace processes and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators in a more general context. My main goal will be to explain the connections between probabilistic and analytical results. Along the way, I will introduce the necessary machinery: Brownian local times and additive functionals, Krein's spectral theory of strings, and Fourier transform methods.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>
