      <title>Stationary and switching synchronization regimes in an ensemble of four nonidentical phase oscillators with repulsive couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the collective dynamics (phase synchronization, instantaneous frequencies synchronization and mean frequencies synchronization) in an ensemble of four nonidentical phase oscillators with repulsive coupling. We use the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi system of ordinary differential equations as our mathematical model. Depending on the coupling strength in the presence of a small mismatch of the natural frequencies, all possible modes of frequency synchronization were found: 4:0 (global), 3:1, 2:2, 2:1:1 (cluster). It is shown that these regimes can be classified into two main types depending on the evolution of the instantaneous frequencies: stationary (4:0 and 2:2), characterized by constancy of phase ratios and instantaneous frequencies, and switching (3:1 and 2:1:1), in which metastable processes with periodic switching of synchronous states are observed: for different time intervals, different types of locking of instantaneous frequencies of oscillator pairs and different types of phase ratios were observed. For the 4:0 and 2:2 regimes, analytical expressions for the synchronization frequencies were derived. The presence of bistability has been revealed depending on the initial conditions of different synchronous regimes at the same parameters: sets of individual frequencies and value of coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Local and global bifurcations to large-scale oblique patterns in inclined layer convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the inclined layer convection system, thermal convection in a Rayleigh--B\'enard cell tilted against gravity, the flow is subject to competing buoyancy and shear forces. For varying inclination angle ($\gamma$) and Rayleigh number ($Ra$), a variety of spatio-temporal patterns is observed. We investigate the switching diamond panes (SDP) pattern, observed at $(\gamma, Ra)\simeq(100\degree,10000)$, which exhibits large-scale oblique features and is one of the five complex tertiary patterns at Prandtl number $Pr=1.07$. First, we study the linear instability of the secondary-state transverse convection rolls and the five branches including two travelling waves and three periodic orbits, bifurcating simultaneously from it. These non-generic bifurcations arise from the breaking of the spatial $D_4$ and $O(2)$ symmetries of transverse rolls, and the resulting bifurcated solutions show large-scale diamond-shaped amplitude modulations. Second, we explore a periodic orbit that captures both the large-scale structure and small-scale defects of modulated rolls. Parametric continuation in $Ra$ reveals the global homoclinic bifurcation via which this periodic orbit emerges. Third, the boundary of the basins of attraction of two dynamically relevant periodic orbits has been characterised. Specifically, additional steady and time-periodic solutions are identified on the basin boundary and their bifurcation structures are analysed. Together, using non-linear invariant solutions and their bifurcations, we take a further step toward understanding the emergence and dynamics of SDP far from the onset of convection, where linear methods have not been applied successfully.</description>

      <title>Beat Frequency Induced Transitions in Synchronization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neurosciences, the brain processes information via the firing patterns of connected neurons operating across a spectrum of frequencies. To better understand the effects of these frequencies in the neuron dynamics, we have simulated a neuronal network of Izhikevich neurons to examine the interaction between frequency allocation and intermittent phase synchronization dynamics. As the synchronized population of neurons passes through a bifurcation, an additional frequency mode emerges, enabling a match in the mean frequency while retaining distinct most probable frequencies among neurons. Subsequently, the network intermittently transits between two patterns, one partially synchronized and the other unsynchronized. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the frequency changes on the network lead to characteristic transition times between synchronization states. Moreover, these transitions adhere to beat frequency statistics when the neurons' frequencies differ by multiples of a frequency gap. Finally, our results can improve the performance in predicting transitions on problems where the beat frequency strongly influences the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Models for Spinning Field Lumps on Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study planar non-topological solitons in models with nonlinear potentials that are bounded from below. These models provide consistent completion for the classical consideration at any energy scale. The properties of our solutions indicate the kinematical stability, which is unachievable in the previously studied model with negative quartic self-interaction. Remarkably, our generalization preserves restoration of the full Schr\"{o}dinger symmetry at low energies, including scale invariance (dilatation) and special conformal symmetry. Our numerical calculations and analytical approximations demonstrate that the details of non-relativistic regime are defined by the lowest nonlinear $U(1)$-invariant term.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonlinear higher-order topological insulators with unconventional boundary truncations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), topologically nontrivial phases are usually associated with the shift of Wannier centers to topologically nontrivial positions on the edges of the unit cells, and the emergence of fractional spectral charges in the corners of the lattice upon its truncation that keeps the number of its unit cells integer. Here we propose theoretically and illustrate experimentally a different approach to the construction of HOTIs. This approach utilizes lattices with incomplete unit cells and achieves localized modes of topological origin across a broader parameter space. When truncation disrupts translational symmetry by cutting through the interior of multiple unit cells, boundary modes in our system emerge for both trivial and topologically nontrivial positions of the Wannier centers. We link these modes to the appearance of fractional Wannier centers. We also demonstrate that linear boundary states give rise to rich families of stable solitons bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity. Multiple types of thresholdless topological solitons with different internal symmetries are observed in waveguide arrays with triangular configurations featuring incomplete unit cells for any dimerization of waveguide spacings. Our results expand the family of HOTIs and pave the way for the observation of boundary states with different symmetries.</description>

      <title>Stable high-charge vortex dissipative solitons in azimuthally modulated waveguide arrays with localized gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and dynamical properties of vortex solitons in Kerr media supported by azimuthally modulated waveguide lattices with localized gain and nonlinear loss. In this dissipative system, we find that the accessible topological charge of vortex solitons is strongly determined by the number of waveguide channels, with higher-order charges requiring progressively larger arrays. Power curves of vortex solitons with different charges exhibit clear separation in large arrays but become less distinguishable in smaller ones. Furthermore, these robust vortex solitons can be excited with nearly vanishing power thresholds, and higher-charge vortices display enhanced propagation stability compared with lower-charge states. These findings expand the family of dissipative vortex solitons supported by waveguide lattices and provide a route to the realization of stable high-symmetry vortex states.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study establishes a non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems. We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system is characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier coefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis. Unlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient matrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance, non-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In particular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic mass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for estimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a non-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed theory is verified by some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic soliton molecules in binary condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in the miscible phase can support polarization solitary waves, known as magnetic solitons. By calculating the interaction potential between two magnetic solitons, we elucidate the mechanisms and conditions for the formation of bound states -- or molecules -- and support these predictions with dynamical simulations. We analytically determine the dissociation energy of bound states consisting of two oppositely polarized solitons and find good agreement with full numerical simulations. Collisions between bound states -- either with other bound states or with individual solitons -- produce intriguing dynamics. Notably, collisions between a pair of bound states exhibit a dipole-like behavior. We anticipate that such bound states, along with their rich collision dynamics, are within reach of current experimental capabilities.</description>
