      <title>Gaming the Metrics? Bibliometric Anomalies and the Integrity Crisis in Global University Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth suggestive of metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, eighteen were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodhart's Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity.</description>

      <title>Behind the Byline: A Large-Scale Study of Scientific Author Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how co-authors distribute credit is critical for accurately assessing scholarly collaboration. In this study, we uncover the implicit structures within scientific teamwork by systematically analyzing author contributions across a large corpus of research publications. We introduce a computational framework designed to convert free-text contribution statements into 14 standardized CRediT categories, identifying clear and consistent positional patterns in task assignments. By analyzing over 400,000 scientific articles from prominent sources such as PLOS One and Nature, we extracted and standardized more than 5.6 million author-task assignments corresponding to 1.58 million author mentions. Our analysis reveals substantial disparities in workload distribution. Notably, in small teams with three co-authors, the most engaged contributor performs over three times more tasks than the least engaged, a disparity that grows linearly with team size. This demonstrates a consistent pattern of central and peripheral roles within modern collaborative teams. Moreover, our analysis shows distinct positional biases in task allocation: technical responsibilities, such as software development and formal analysis, broadly fall to authors positioned earlier in the author list, whereas managerial tasks, including supervision and funding acquisition, increasingly concentrate among authors positioned toward the end. This gradient underscores a significant division of labor, where early-listed authors mainly undertake most hands-on activities. In contrast, senior authors mostly assume roles involving leadership and oversight. Our findings highlight the structured and hierarchical organization within scholarly collaborations, providing deeper insights into the specific roles and dynamics that govern academic teamwork</description>

      <title>A digital perspective on the role of a stemma in material-philological transmission studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking its point of departure in the recent developments in the field of digital humanities and the increasing automatisation of scholarly workflows, this study explores the implications of digital approaches to textual traditions for the broader field of textual scholarship. It argues that the relative simplicity of creating computergenerated stemmas allows us to view the stemma codicum as a research tool rather than the final product of our scholarly investigation. Using the Old Norse saga of Hr\'omundur as a case study, this article demonstrates that stemmas can serve as a starting point for exploring textual traditions further. In doing so, they enable us to address research questions that otherwise remain unanswered. The article is accompanied by datasets used to generate stemmas for the Hr\'omundar saga tradition as well as two custom Python scripts. The scripts are designed to convert XML-based textual data, encoded according to the TEI Guidelines, into the input format used for the analysis in the PHYLIP package to generate unrooted trees of relationships between texts.</description>

      <title>From raw affiliations to organization identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07577v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate affiliation matching, which links affiliation strings to standardized organization identifiers, is critical for improving research metadata quality, facilitating comprehensive bibliometric analyses, and supporting data interoperability across scholarly knowledge bases. Existing approaches fail to handle the complexity of affiliation strings that often include mentions of multiple organizations or extraneous information. In this paper, we present AffRo, a novel approach designed to address these challenges, leveraging advanced parsing and disambiguation techniques. We also introduce AffRoDB, an expert-curated dataset to systematically evaluate affiliation matching algorithms, ensuring robust benchmarking. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of AffRp in accurately identifying organizations from complex affiliation strings.</description>

      <title>Billions at Stake: How Self-Citation Adjusted Metrics Can Transform Equitable Research Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Citation metrics serve as the cornerstone of scholarly impact evaluation despite their well-documented vulnerability to inflation through self-citation practices. This paper introduces the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a sophisticated metric designed to recalibrate citation counts by accounting for discipline-specific self-citation patterns. Through comprehensive analysis of 5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines, we demonstrate that excessive self-citation inflates traditional metrics by 10-20%, potentially misdirecting billions in research funding. Recent studies confirm that self-citation patterns exhibit significant gender disparities, with men self-citing up to 70% more frequently than women, exacerbating existing inequalities in academic recognition. Our open-source implementation provides comprehensive tools for calculating SCAI and related metrics, offering a more equitable assessment of research impact that reduces the gender citation gap by approximately 8.5%. This work contributes to the paradigm shift toward transparent, nuanced, and equitable research evaluation methodologies in academia, with direct implications for funding allocation decisions that collectively amount to over $100 billion annually in the United States alone.</description>
