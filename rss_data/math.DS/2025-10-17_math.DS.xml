      <title>Functional and parametric identifiability for universal differential equations applied to chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling has traditionally relied on detailed system knowledge to construct mechanistic models. However, the advent of large-scale data collection and advances in machine learning have led to an increasing use of data-driven approaches. Recently, hybrid models have emerged that combine both paradigms: well-understood system components are modelled mechanistically, while unknown parts are inferred from data. Here, we focus on one such class: universal differential equations (UDEs), where neural networks are embedded within differential equations to approximate unknown dynamics. When fitted to data, these networks act as universal function approximators, learning missing functional components. In this work, we note that UDE identifiability, i.e. our ability to identify true system properties, can be split into parametric and functional identifiability (assessing identifiability for the mechanistic and data-driven model parts, respectively). Next, we investigate how UDE properties, such as neural network numbers and constraints, affect parametric and functional identifiability. Notably, we show that across a wide range of models, the generalisation of a fully mechanistic model to a UDE has little impact on the mechanistic components' parametric identifiability. Finally, we note that hybrid modelling through the fitting of unknown functions (as achieved by UDEs) is particularly well-suited to chemical reaction network (CRN) modelling. Here, CRNs are used in fields ranging from systems biology, chemistry, and pharmacology to epidemiology and population dynamics, making them highly relevant for study. By showcasing how CRN-based UDE models can be highly interpretable, we demonstrate that this hybrid approach is a promising avenue for future applications.</description>

      <title>Return Times Distribution of Expanding Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider expanding systems with invariant measures that are uniformly expanding everywhere except on a small measure set and show that the limiting statistics of hitting times for zero measure sets are compound Poisson provided the limits for the cluster size distributions exist. This extends previous results from neighbourhoods around single points to neighbourhoods around zero measure sets. The assumptions require the correlations to decay at least polynomially and the non-uniformly expanding part of the iterates of the map also has to satisfy some decay condition. We also require some regularity conditions around the limiting zero measure target set.</description>

      <title>Construction of equilibrium states revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [52], Parmenter and Pollicott establish an abstract criterion that gives a geometric construction of equilibrium states for a class of partially hyperbolic systems. We refine their criterion to cover a much broader class of diffeomorphisms, which include certain diffeomorphisms with exponential mixing property (with respect to volume), Katok maps and ``almost Anosov'' diffeomorphisms. As a special case, we obtain a construction of equilibrium states for ergodic partially hyperbolic affine maps/flows on homogeneous spaces, without any restrictions on the orbit growth along center directions.</description>

      <title>Blending attractors of Iterated Function Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a new method to blend fractal attractors using the code map for the IFS formed by the Hutchinson--Barnsley operators of a finite family of hyperbolic IFSs. We introduce a parameter called blending coefficient to measure the similarity between the blended set and each one of the original attractors. We also introduce a discrete approximation algorithm and prove a rigorous error estimation used to approximate these new objects. Several simulation results are provided illustrating our techniques.</description>

      <title>Computation of attractor dimension and maximal sums of Lyapunov exponents using polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two approaches are presented for computing upper bounds on Lyapunov exponents and their sums, and on Lyapunov dimension, among all trajectories of a dynamical system governed by ordinary differential equations. The first approach expresses a sum of Lyapunov exponents as a time average in an augmented dynamical system and then applies methods for bounding time averages. This generalizes the work of Oeri &amp; Goluskin (Nonlinearity 36:5378-5400, 2023), who bounded the single leading Lyapunov exponent. The second approach considers a different augmented dynamical system, where bounds on sums of Lyapunov exponents are implied by stability of certain sets, and such stability is verified using Lyapunov function methods. Both of our approaches also can be adapted to directly compute bounds on Lyapunov dimension, which in turn implies bounds on the fractal dimension of a global attractor. For systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial right-hand sides, all of our bounding formulations lead to polynomial optimization problems with sum-of-squares constraints. These sum-of-squares problems can be solved computationally for any particular system to yield numerical bounds, provided the number of variables and degree of polynomials is not prohibitive. Most of our upper bounds are proven to be sharp under relatively weak assumptions. In the case of the polynomial optimization problems, sharpness means that upper bounds converge to the exact values as polynomial degrees are raised. Computational examples demonstrate upper bounds that are sharp to several digits, including for a six-dimensional dynamical system where sums of Lyapunov exponents are maximized on periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Control of dynamical systems with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control problems frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications, where the objective is to steer a dynamical system from an initial state to a desired target state. Recent advances in deep learning and automatic differentiation have made applying these methods to control problems increasingly practical. In this paper, we examine the use of neural networks and modern machine-learning libraries to parameterize control inputs across discrete-time and continuous-time systems, as well as deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We highlight applications in multiple domains, including biology, engineering, physics, and medicine. For continuous-time dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) offer a useful approach to parameterizing control inputs. For discrete-time systems, we show how custom control-input parameterizations can be implemented and optimized using automatic-differentiation methods. Overall, the methods presented provide practical solutions for control tasks that are computationally demanding or analytically intractable, making them valuable for complex real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider $\phi$-mixing measures and show that the limiting return times distribution is compound Poisson distribution as the target sets shrink to a zero measure set. The approach we use generalises a method given by Galves and Schmitt in 1997 for the first entry time to higher orders.</description>

      <title>The number of rational iterated preimages of the origin under unicritical polynomial maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rational iterated preimages of the origin under unicritical maps $f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$. Earlier works of Faber--Hutz--Stoll and Hutz--Hyde--Krause established finiteness and conditional bounds in the quadratic case. Building on this, we prove that for $d=2$ and $c \in \mathbb Q\setminus\{0,-1\}$ there are no rational fourth preimages of the origin, and for all $d \geq 3$ there are no rational second preimages outside trivial cases. The proof relies on geometric analysis of preimage curves, the elliptic Chabauty method, and Diophantine reduction. As a result, we determine the number of rational iterated preimages of $0$ under $f_{d,c}$ for all $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>The growth rate of closed prime magnetic geodesics on closed contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any given closed contact manifold, there exists an infinite-dimensional space of Riemannian metrics which can be identified with the space of bundle metrics on the induced contact distribution. For each such metric, and for all energy levels, the number of embedded periodic orbits of the corresponding magnetic geodesic flow grows at least as fast as the number of geometrically distinct periodic Reeb orbits of period less than $t$.
  As a corollary, we deduce that for every closed 3-manifold which is not a graph manifold, there exists an open $C^1$-neighborhood of the set of nondegenerate contact forms such that for each contact form in this neighborhood, there exists an infinite-dimensional space of Riemannian metrics as above. For the corresponding magnetic systems, the number of prime closed magnetic geodesics grows at least exponentially on all energy levels. Consequently, the restriction of the magnetic geodesic flow to any energy surface has positive topological entropy.</description>

      <title>On the order of lazy cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the most elementary family of cellular automata defined over an arbitrary group universe $G$ and an alphabet $A$: the lazy cellular automata, which act as the identity on configurations in $A^G$, except when they read a unique active transition $p \in A^S$, in which case they write a fixed symbol $a \in A$. As expected, the dynamical behavior of lazy cellular automata is relatively simple, yet subtle questions arise since they completely depend on the choice of $p$ and $a$. In this paper, we investigate the order of a lazy cellular automaton $\tau : A^G \to A^G$, defined as the cardinality of the set $\{ \tau^k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$. In particular, we establish a general upper bound for the order of $\tau$ in terms of $p$ and $a$, and we prove that this bound is attained when $p$ is a quasi-constant pattern.</description>

      <title>A Novel Route to Oscillations via non-central SNICeroclinic Bifurcation: Unfolding the Separatrix Loop Between a Saddle-Node and a Saddle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate saddle-node to saddle separatrix--loops that we term SNICeroclinic bifurcations. They are generic codimension-two bifurcations involving a heteroclinic loop between one non-hyperbolic and one hyperbolic saddle. A particular codimension-three case is the non-central SNICeroclinic bifurcation. We unfold this bifurcation in the minimal dimension (planar) case where the non-hyperbolic point is assumed to undergo a saddle-node bifurcation. Applying the method of Poincar\'e return maps, we present a minimal set of perturbations that captures all qualitatively distinct behaviors near a non-central SNICeroclinic loop. Specifically, we study how variation of the three unfolding parameters leads to transitions from heteroclinic and homoclinic loops, saddle-node on an invariant circle (SNIC), and periodic orbits as well as equilibria. We show that although the bifurcation has been largely unexplored in applications, it can act as an organizing center for transitions between various types of saddle-node and saddle separatrix loops. It is also a generic route to oscillations that are both born and destroyed via global bifurcations, compared to the commonly observed scenarios involving local (Hopf) and in some cases global (homoclinic or SNIC) bifurcations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore the effect of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry on grazing-sliding bifurcations in planar Filippov systems. We consider the scenario where the unperturbed system is $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric and its subsystem exhibits a hyperbolic limit cycle grazing the discontinuity boundary at a fold. Employing differential manifold theory, we reveal the intrinsic quantities of unfolding all bifurcations and rigorously demonstrate the emergence of a codimension-two bifurcation under generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric perturbations within the Filippov framework. After deriving an explicit non-degenerate condition with respect to parameters, we systematically establish the complete bifurcation diagram with exact asymptotics for all bifurcation boundaries by displacement map method combined with asymptotic analysis.</description>

Abstract: The theory of polynomial-like maps is of fundamental importance in holomorphic dynamics. We study dynamical properties of a larger class of maps. Our main result is that, under some natural conditions, a map of this class has a completely invariant compact set if and only if this set is the filled Julia set of a polynomial-like restriction of the map. We also generalize this result to include maps with non-connected domains of definition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss all the possible pairs $(u,c)\in C(M,\mathbb R)\times\mathbb R$ solving (in the sense of viscosity) the contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation \[ H (x, d_xu, u) = c,\quad x\in M \] of which $M$ is a closed manifold and the continuous Hamiltonian $H: (x,p,u)\in T^*M\times\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is convex, coercive in $p$ but merely non-decreasing in $u$. Firstly, we propose a comparison principle for solutions by using the dynamical information of Mather measures. We then describe the structure of $\mathfrak C$ containing all the $c\in\mathbb R$ makes previous equation solvable. We also propose examples to verify the optimality of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we aim at giving a more conceptual and simpler proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of type II minimal locus of the resultant function $\operatorname{ordRes}_\phi$ on the Berkovich hyperbolic space for a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete field that is equipped with a non-trivial and non-archimedean absolute value, and also aim at giving a much simpler and more natural proof of a degenerating limit theorem, in an improved form after DeMarco--Faber, for the family of the unique maximal entropy measures on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ associated to a meromorphic family of complex rational functions. We introduce the intrinsic reduction of a non-archimedean rational function $\phi$ at each point in the Berkovich projective line and its directionwise intrinsic depths, which are suitable notions for the above aims and defined in terms of the tree and analytic structures of the Berkovich projective line. Then we establish two theorems in non-archimedean dynamics, both of which play key roles in the above aims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of the singular set of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a singular holomorphic foliation of dimension $k&gt;1$ on a projective $n$-manifold $X$. Assume that the determinant of the normal sheaf of $\mathcal{F}$ is ample (as is always the case when $X=\mathbb{P}^{n}$), and that the singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\leq k-1$. We show that the union of those irreducible components of $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ of dimension exactly $k-1$ is necessarily connected. Consequently, we obtain a Bott-type topological obstruction to the integrability of singular holomorphic distributions, echoing Bott's vanishing theorem, and we answer a question of Cerveau for codimension-one foliations on $\mathbb{P}^{3}$.</description>
