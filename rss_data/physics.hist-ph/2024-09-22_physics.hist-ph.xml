      <title>Music, Immortality, and the Soul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music has been called the temporal art par excellence. Yet, as this paper explains, it is also the atemporal art par excellence. The contradiction is, however, only apparent, and a result of viewing music from two possible perspectives. That it has these two perspectives is the focus of this paper. In particular, the way in which these two aspects of music allow it to function as a kind of conduit between transcendent and immanent; immaterial and material. This can help explain the power of music to touch places deep in the soul (the part of us that transcends matter and time), that other forms of art struggle to reach. A somewhat similar debate occurs in looking at mathematics from an ontological point of view. In particular the treatment of the real numbers. There are curious properties of real numbers that seem to put them, like music, in the realm of the transcendent: in terms of the amount of information to specify them, one requires infinite computer time since there is no repeating pattern to their decimal expansions. One must simply evolve the sequence, working through it, despite the fact that it might have a perfectly situated home in Platonia. In other words, bringing them into this world demands a temporal element. We explore these and other links to a variety of issues in physics, ultimately arguing for dual-aspect monism.</description>

      <title>A contextual analysis of the early work of Andrzej Trautman and Ivor Robinson on equations of motion and gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.03753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a series of papers published in the course of his dissertation work in the mid 1950's, Andrzej Trautman drew upon the slow motion approximation developed by his advisor Infeld, the general covariance based strong conservation laws enunciated by Bergmann and Goldberg, the Riemann tensor attributes explored by Goldberg and related geodesic deviation exploited by Pirani, the permissible metric discontinuities identified by Lichnerowicz, O'Brien and Synge, and finally Petrov's classification of vacuum spacetimes. With several significant additions he produced a comprehensive overview of the state of research in equations of motion and gravitational waves that was presented in a widely cited series of lectures at King's College, London, in 1958. Fundamental new contributions were the formulation of boundary conditions representing outgoing gravitational radiation the deduction of its Petrov type, a covariant expression for null wave fronts, and a derivation of the correct mass loss formula due to radiation emission. Ivor Robinson had already in 1956 developed a bi-vector based technique that had resulted in his rediscovery of exact plane gravitational wave solutions of Einstein's equations. He was the first to characterize shear-free null geodesic congruences. He and Trautman met in London in 1958, and there resulted a long-term collaboration whose initial fruits were the Robinson-Trautman metric, examples of which were exact spherical gravitational waves.</description>
