      <title>Singular Excitement Beyond the Horizon of a Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector, when coupled linearly to a massless scalar field and permitted to fall radially into certain black holes, will exhibit non-monotonicity in its transition properties near the horizon. Specifically, the transition probability of a detector freely falling into a (3+1)-dimensional Schawrzschild black hole, when considering the Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacuum states, was shown to possess a local extremum at horizon crossing [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. The transition rate of a detector falling into a static (2+1)-dimensional Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, for the Hartle-Hawking state, was also found to have multiple local extrema near the horizon under certain parameter settings [M.R. Preciado-Rivas et al., arXiv:2402.14908v1]. These discoveries are of interest, as they suggest that the event horizon of a black hole may be distinguishable to a local probe when QFT effects are included. In this paper, we explore the problem of a UDW detector falling freely into a rotating BTZ black hole. We numerically compute the detector's transition rate for different values of black hole mass, black hole angular momentum, detector energy gap, and field boundary conditions at infinity. Our results lead to a more generalized description of the behaviour of particle detectors in BTZ black hole spacetime, from which the previous non-rotating BTZ case can be retrieved in the limit as angular momentum vanishes.</description>

      <title>Realistic binary neutron star initial data with Elliptica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the Elliptica pseudo-spectral code for generating initial data of binary neutron star systems. Building upon the recent Elliptica code update, we can now construct initial data using not only piecewise polytropic equations of state, but also tabulated equations of state for these binary systems. Furthermore, the code allows us to endow neutron stars within the binary system with spins. These spins can have a magnitude close to the mass shedding limit and can point in any direction.</description>

      <title>Time and its arrow from quantum geometrodynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum geometrodynamics, a conservative approach to quantum gravity, might explain the emergence of classical spacetime and, with it, the emergence of classical time and its arrow from the universal quantum state. This follows from a particular but reasonable choice of boundary condition motivated by the structure of the Hamiltonian of the theory. This condition can also be seen as defining a quantum version of Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis. We comment on the relation of this picture to the `past hypothesis' and the different observed arrows of time, and we consider how quantum geometrodynamics could serve as a unifying and more fundamental framework to explain these observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Fundamental Constants with Fast Radio Bursts: Unveiling the Role of Energy Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding physical mechanisms relies on the accurate determination of fundamental constants, although inherent limitations in experimental techniques introduce uncertainties into these measurements. This paper explores the uncertainties associated with measuring the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$) and the proton-to-electron mass ratio ($\mu$) using observed fast radio bursts (FRBs). We select 50 localized FRBs to quantify the effects of varying this fundamental coupling on the relation between dispersion measure and redshift. By leveraging independent measurements of dispersion measures and redshifts of these FRBs, we constrain the uncertainties in $\alpha$ and $\mu$ approximately to $\Delta\alpha/\alpha=1.99\times 10^{-5}$ and $\Delta\mu/\mu=-1.00\times 10^{-5}$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Remarkably, these constraints improve nearly an order-of-magnitude when considering a dynamical dark energy model. This investigation not only yields one of the most stringent constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$ to date but also emphasizes the criticality of accounting for the energy scale of the system when formulating constraints on fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>A Cosmological Holographic Reconstruction of f(Q) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a cosmological reconstruction scheme in the background of f(Q) gravity theory from a Holographic perspective. The basic motivation for this work is that the reconstruction is performed from a holographic origin, which has its roots in the black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. Dark energy models inspired by holographic prescription are used to reconstruct the f(Q) gravity models. Two such models, namely the Granda-Oliveros holographic dark energy model and its generalization, the Chen- Jing model are considered for the study. Different scale factors are used and a thorough reconstruction scheme is set up using the dark energy models. The observationally constrained values of the free model parameters have been used to form the reconstructed models. Finally, a thorough investigation of the energy conditions has been performed to check the cosmological viability of the reconstructed f(Q) models. As an outcome, we get some very promising and cosmologically viable f(Q) models that present some interesting properties and demand further investigation.</description>

      <title>Study of Anisotropic Compact Stars in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}_{\chi\xi}\mathcal{T}^{\chi\xi})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to examine the composition of various spherically symmetric star models which are coupled with anisotropic configuration in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{Q})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{Q}=\mathcal{R}_{\chi\xi}\mathcal{T}^{\chi\xi}$. We discuss the physical features of compact objects by employing bag model equation of state and construct the modified field equations in terms of Krori-Barua ansatz involving unknowns ($A,B,C$). The observational data of 4U 1820-30,~Vela X-I,~SAX J 1808.4-3658,~RXJ 1856-37 and Her X-I is used to calculate these unknowns and bag constant $\mathfrak{B_c}$. Further, we observe the behavior of energy density, radial and tangential pressure as well as anisotropy through graphical interpretation for a viable model $\mathcal{R}+\varrho\mathcal{Q}$ of this gravity. For a particular value of the coupling constant $\varrho$, we study the behavior of mass, compactness, redshift and the energy bounds. The stability of the considered stars is also checked by using two criteria. We conclude that our developed structure in this gravity is in well-agreement with all the physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Timelike bound orbits and pericenter precession around black hole with conformally coupled scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geodesic motions of timelike particles around a static hairy black hole with conformally coupled scalar field. We mainly focus on the effects of the scalar charge and electric charge on the marginally bound orbits (MBO), innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and on the precessing orbits around this black hole. Our results show that both the scalar and electric charges suppress the energy as well as the angular momentum of the particles in the bound orbits. Then, we study the relativistic periastron precessions of the particles and constrain the charge parameters by employing the observational result of the S2 star's precession in SgrA*. It is found that the constraints on the charge parameters from S2 star's motion are tighter than those from black hole shadow. Finally, we analyze the periodic motions of the particles and figure out samples of periodic orbits' configurations around the hairy black hole.</description>

      <title>Extended Uncertainty Principle: A Deeper Insight into the Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, known as the LambdaCDM model, has been successful in many respects, but it has some significant discrepancies, some of which have not been resolved yet. In measuring the Hubble-Lematre parameter, there is an apparent discrepancy which is known as the Hubble tension, defined as differences in values of this parameter measured by the Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) data (a model-independent method) and by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation maps (a model-dependent method). Although many potential solutions have been proposed, the issue still remains unresolved. Recently, it was observed that the Hubble tension can be due to the concept of uncertainty in measuring cosmological parameters at large distance scales through applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) in cosmological setups. Extending this pioneering idea, in the present study we plan to incorporate the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) containing a minimal fundamental measurable momentum (or equivalently, a maximal fundamental measurable length) as a candidate setup for describing large-scale effects of Quantum Gravity (QG) to address the Hubble tension and constrain the EUP length scale. In this regard, by finding a relevant formula for the effective photon rest mass in terms of the present-time value of the Hubble-Lematre parameter, we see that discrepancies in the value of photon rest mass associated with the Hubble-Lematre parameter values estimated from model-independent and model-dependent methods perhaps is the cause of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky equation for near-extremal black holes beyond general relativity: near-horizon analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations on the near-horizon region of extremal and near-extremal rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein gravity. We find a decoupled modified Teukolsky equation that rules the gravitational perturbations and that separates into an angular and a radial equation. The angular equation leads to a deformation of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, while the radial equation takes the same form as in Kerr except for a modification of the angular separation constants. We provide a detailed analysis of the corrections to these angular separation constants and find analytic results for axisymmetric modes as well as in the eikonal limit. As an application, we reproduce recent results that show that extremal Kerr black holes in higher-derivative gravity become singular under certain deformations and extend them by including parity-breaking corrections, which we show lead to the same effect. Finally, we obtain constraints on the form of the full modified Teukolsky radial equation by demanding that it has the right near-horizon limit. These results serve as an stepping stone towards the study of quasinormal modes of near-extremal black holes in higher-derivative extensions of GR.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between two exact gravitational lens equations in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virbhadra and Ellis have proposed an exact equation (referred to as VE equation) for the gravitational lens in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime [Phys. Rev. D 62,084003 (2000)], whereas an improved equation (referred to as BTOA equation) has been derived by Bozza [Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)] and later by Takizawa, Ono and Asada [Phys. Rev. D, 102, 064060 (2020)]. VE and BTOA equations seem to be very different from each other. The present paper shows that there exists an unphysical branch in VE equation. Consequently, VE equation can be reduced by removing the unphysical branch. The reduced version of VE equation is found to be the same as BTOA equation when a suitable transformation is made between the deflection angles defined differently in the two formulations. An explicit expression of the transformation is found. We also argue possible numerical errors when the transformation between the deflection angles is ignored.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bremsstrahlung Waveform at the fourth Post-Minkowskian order and the second Post-Newtonian level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian formalism, we compute the frequency-domain waveform generated by the gravitational scattering of two nonspinning bodies at the fourth post-Minkowskian order ($O(G^4)$, or two-loop order), and at the fractional second Post-Newtonian accuracy ($O(v^4/c^4)$). The waveform is decomposed in spin-weighted spherical harmonics and the needed radiative multipoles, $U_{\ell m}(\omega), V_{\ell m}(\omega)$, are explicitly expressed in terms of a small number of master integrals. The basis of master integrals contains both (modified) Bessel functions, and solutions of inhomogeneous Bessel equations with Bessel-function sources. We show how to express the latter in terms of Meijer G functions. The low-frequency expansion of our results is checked againg existing classical soft theorems. We also complete our previous results on the $O(G^2)$ bremsstrahlung waveform by computing the $O(G^3)$ spectral densities of radiated energy and momentum, in the rest frame of one body, at the thirtieth order in velocity.</description>

      <title>Guided Waves in Static Curved Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of electromagnetic waves in waveguides within static curved spacetimes. We develop a covariant formalism using Hertzian potentials to describe guided electromagnetic modes in spacetimes with metrics that depend on the proper length along the waveguide axis. The Maxwell equations are solved using a Hertzian potential ansatz, resulting in wave equations for TE and TM modes. We analyze the axial and transverse components of the solutions and derive expressions for the cutoff frequency and guide wavelength. The special case of TEM modes is also examined. As an illustrative example, we apply the formalism to radial propagation in Schwarzschild spacetime. This work provides a framework for studying guided electromagnetic waves in curved spacetime geometries, opening up potential applications in precision tests of general relativity and relativistic quantum optics.</description>

      <title>A Casimir-like probe for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual transitions in a Casimir-like configuration are utilized to probe quantum aspects of the recently proposed four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity. This study employs a quantum optics-based approach, wherein an Unruh-DeWitt detector (modeled as a two-level atom) follows a radial timelike geodesic, falling freely into an uncharged, nonrotating black hole described by 4D EGB gravity, becoming thermalized in the usual Unruh manner. The black hole, asymptotically Minkowskian, is enclosed by a Casimir boundary proximate to its horizon, serving as a source for accelerated field modes that interact with the infalling detector. Observations are conducted by an asymptotic infinity observer, assuming a Boulware field state. Our numerical analysis reveals that, unlike in Einstein gravity, black holes in 4D EGB gravity can either enhance or suppress the intensity of acceleration radiation, contingent upon the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha$. Specifically, we observe radiation enhancement for negative $\alpha$ and suppression for positive $\alpha$. These findings offer substantial insights into quantifying the influence of higher-curvature contributions on the behavior of quantum fields in black hole geometries within a 4D spacetime.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in TGFT: Landau-Ginzburg analysis of the causally complete Lorentzian Barrett-Crane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is expected that continuum spacetime emerges via phase transition in the tensorial group field theory (TGFT) approach to quantum gravity. Recent work on the application of Landau-Ginzburg mean-field theory to progressively realistic TGFT models has demonstrated how phase transitions can be realized therein. Here, we further develop this setting and consider the causally complete Lorentzian Barrett-Crane (BC) model which includes not only spacelike but also timelike and lightlike tetrahedra as quantum geometric building blocks. In addition, we incorporate discretized scalar fields by $\mathbb{R}$-valued variables of the group fields. In this context, we analyze models with an arbitrary single interaction of simplicial and tensor-invariant type, extend it to the model with the two vertices well-known from causal dynamical triangulations, and also consider a model with colored simplicial interactions. As a main result, we demonstrate for all those cases that a mean-field approximation of a phase transition towards a non-trivial condensate state can always be realized. In particular, we show that the critical behavior is entirely driven by spacelike faces which are characterized by the boost part of the Lorentz group. The latter induces an exponential suppression of fluctuations which then stabilizes the mean-field vacuum. In contrast, timelike faces do not play a role in this as they are characterized by the rotational and thus compact part of the Lorentz group. Since such a state is typically populated by a large number of TGFT quanta, our work lends further considerable support to the existence of a sensible continuum gravitational regime for causally complete TGFT models. Our results also indirectly strengthen the derivation of effective cosmological dynamics and the recently improved study of scalar cosmological perturbations within a mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic model of inflation without inflaton field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of geometrothermodynamics, we explore how to construct an inflationary cosmic fluid without requiring inflaton fields. To do so, we employ standard radiation and matter as barotropic background, speculating on the existence of a further real fluid, interpreted as a possible matter with pressure constituent. We thus illustrate its main characteristics, showing how it may face the flatness and horizon problems, yielding an equivalent number of e-foldings, compatible with theoretical expectations. Moreover, we calculate the associated equilibrium and kinetic temperatures, and compute out-of-equilibrium properties, in terms of particle production and effective reheating mechanism. Accordingly, we revise how inflation ends and how to fix the free parameters of our model from observations. Last but not least, we propose how to obtain a bare cosmological constant that could relate the late-time acceleration to inflation, aiming to unify the two approaches. Finally, we discuss the corresponding theoretical implications of our treatment in contrast to the standard approach reliant on scalar field potentials, emphasizing the main advantages and disadvantages.</description>

Abstract: The collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) via the general-relativistic (GR) instability would provide a natural explanation to the existence of the most extreme quasars. The presence of dark matter in SMSs is thought to potentially impact their properties, in particular their mass at collapse. Dark matter might be made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that can be captured by the gravitational potential well of SMSs due to interaction with the baryonic gas. The annihilation of WIMPs can provide fuel to support the star before H-burning ignition, favouring low densities of baryonic gas, long stellar lifetimes and high final masses. Here, we estimate the impact of dark matter on the GR dynamical stability of rapidly accreting SMSs. We add a dark matter term to the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations and apply it to hylotropic structures in order to determine the onset point of the GR instability. We find that, in principle, the dark matter gravitational field can remove completely the GR instability. However, for SMSs fuelled by H-burning, the dark matter densities required to stabilise the star against GR are orders of magnitude above the values that are expected for the dark matter background. On the other hand, for SMSs fuelled by WIMP annihilation, we find that the low densities of baryonic gas inhibit the destabilising GR corrections, which shifts the stability limit by typically an order of magnitude towards higher masses. As long as central temperatures $\lesssim10^7$ K are maintained by WIMP annihilation, the GR instability is reached only for stellar masses $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$. Dark matter can impact the GR dynamical stability of SMSs only in the case of energetically significant WIMP annihilation. The detection of a SMS with mass $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$ in an atomically cooled halo can be interpreted as an evidence of WIMP annihilation in the star's core.</description>

      <title>Host Galaxy Demographics Of Individually Detectable Supermassive Black-hole Binaries with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) produce gravitational waves (GWs) that are detectable with pulsar timing arrays. We determine the properties of the host galaxies of simulated MBHBs at the time they are producing detectable GW signals. The population of MBHB systems we evaluate is from the Illustris cosmological simulations taken in tandem with post processing semi-analytic models of environmental factors in the evolution of binaries. Upon evolving to the GW frequency regime accessible by pulsar timing arrays, we calculate the detection probability of each system using a variety of different values for pulsar noise characteristics in a plausible near-future International Pulsar Timing Array dataset. We find that detectable systems have host galaxies that are clearly distinct from the overall binary population and from most galaxies in general. With conservative noise factors, we find that host stellar metallicity, for example, peaks at twice solar metallicity as opposed to the total population of galaxies which peaks at ~0.6 solar metallicity. Additionally, the most detectable systems are much brighter in magnitude and more red in color than the overall population, indicating their likely identity as large ellipticals with diminished star formation. These results can be used to develop effective search strategies for identifying host galaxies and electromagnetic counterparts following GW detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for black hole interiors: non-isometries, quantum extremal surfaces, and wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use hyperbolic tensor networks to construct a holographic map for black hole interiors that adds a notion of locality to the non-isometric codes proposed by Akers, Engelhardt, Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan. We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on quantum complexity of time-dependent oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work had shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It provides a proof of concept for the application of Nielsen complexity in cosmology, together with a systematic setting in which higher-order terms can be included.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes in the Randall-Sundrum model with brane-localized curvature terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the scattering amplitudes of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in Randall-Sundrum models with brane-localized curvature terms. We show that the presence of brane-localized curvature interactions modifies the properties of (4D) scalar fluctuations of the metric, resulting in scattering amplitudes of the massive spin-2 KK states which grow as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ instead of ${\cal O}(s)$. We uncover new constraints on the size of the brane-localized curvature interactions based on the consistency of the Sturm-Liouville mode systems of the spin-2 and spin-0 metric fluctuations. We connect the properties of the scattering amplitudes to the diffeomorphism invariance of the compactified KK theory with brane-localized curvature interactions. We verify that the scattering amplitudes involving brane-localized external sources (matter) are diffeomorphism-invariant, but show that those for matter localized at an arbitrary point in the bulk are not. We demonstrate that, in Feynman gauge, the spin-0 Goldstone bosons corresponding to helicity-0 states of the massive spin-2 KK bosons behave as a tower of Galileons, and that it is their interactions that produce the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes. We also outline the correspondence between our results and those in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. In an appendix we discuss the analogous issue in extra-dimensional gauge theory, and show that the presence of a brane-localized gauge kinetic-energy term does not change the high-energy behavior of corresponding KK vector boson scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Semifinite von Neumann algebras in gauge theory and gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: von Neumann algebras have been playing an increasingly important role in the context of gauge theories and gravity. The crossed product presents a natural method for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering it a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product of a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which means that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field theories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness of the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group containing the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies the centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide evidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we construct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We comment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion physics in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing inflationary model predictions via refined slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm not only addresses early Universe puzzles but also aligns well with the observational constraints, with slow-roll inflationary models fitting best. Evaluating these model predictions requires considering both slow-roll inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. This involves the quantitative analysis that takes into account the effective equation of state (EoS) and duration of reheating, connecting these with the perturbations generated deep during the inflationary era. Given the complexities involved, many approximations are often used for simplification. However, as future observations are expected to improve the accuracy of these observables significantly, this work takes a different approach. Instead of relying on approximations, we consider the near-accurate solutions of inflationary models and compare our results with the pre-existing ones. It mainly incorporates two improvements: the first is the accurate dynamics of the slow-roll evolution, and, thus, the end of inflation; and the second is the higher-order slow-roll corrections to the perturbed observables. Our findings indicate that, by implementing these corrections, the theoretical predictions improve significantly. It also indicates that seemingly minor corrections can have significant effects on the perturbed observables, and these refined predictions can be compared with future observations to potentially rule out models and help resolve the degeneracy problem of the inflationary paradigm.</description>

Abstract: Hawking's black hole area theorem provides a geometric realization of the second law of thermodynamics and constrains gravitational processes. In this work we explore a one-parameter extension of this constraint formulated in terms of the monotonicity properties of R\'enyi entropies. We focus on black hole mergers in asymptotically AdS space and determine new restrictions which these R\'enyi second laws impose on the final state. We evaluate the entropic inequalities starting from the thermodynamic ensembles description of black hole geometries, and find that for many situations they set more stringent bounds than those imposed by the area increase theorem.</description>

      <title>Aspects of dS/CFT Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that a $dS_{d+1}$ spacetime of radius $R_{ds}$ has a holographic dual, living at future space-like infinity ${\cal I}^+$, with the bulk wave function being dual to the partition function of the boundary theory, [arXiv:astro-ph/0210603v5]. We consider some aspects of this correspondence. For under damped scalars with mass $M^2R_{ds}^2&gt;{d^2\over4}$, belonging to the principal series, we show that for the Bunch Davies vacuum a suitable source in the boundary theory can be identified in terms of the coherent state representation of the wave function. We argue that terms in the resulting correlation functions, which are independent of the late time cut-off, satisfy the Ward identities of a conformal field theory. We also discuss other ways to identify sources, both in the under damped and the over damped case, where $M^2R_{ds}^2&lt;{d^2\over4}$, and argue that these too can lead to correlators satisfying the Ward identities of a CFT. Some comments on the violation of reflection positivity, and the cut-off dependent terms, along with some explicit checks and sample calculations, are also included.</description>

      <title>A new bump in the night: evidence of a new feature in the binary black hole mass distribution at $70~M_{\odot}$ from gravitational-wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the confident binary black hole (BBH) detections from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) with an alternative mass population model in order to capture features in the mass distribution beyond the Powerlaw + Peak model. We find that the peak of a second power law characterizes the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ bump, such that the data marginally prefers a mixture of two power laws for the mass distribution of binary components over a Powerlaw + Peak model with a Bayes Factor $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}$ of 0.1. This result may imply that the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ feature represents the onset of a second population of BBH mergers (e.g. from a dynamical formation channel) rather than a specific mass feature over a broader distribution. When an additional Gaussian bump is allowed within our power law mixture model, we find a new feature in the BH mass spectrum at $\sim65-70~M_\odot$. This new feature may be consistent with hierarchical mergers, and constitute $\sim2\%$ of the BBH population. This model also recovers a maximum mass of $58^{+30}_{-14}~M_\odot$ for the second power law, consistent with the onset of a pair-instability supernova mass gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the models addressing the Hubble tension, those introducing a dynamical dark component around recombination have been the most promising thus far. Their study has highlighted that, in fact, cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations can allow for such components before and near recombination.
  The new dynamical degree of freedom can be early dark energy (EDE) or early modified gravity depending on its coupling to gravity. We study a new model, $\mathcal{G}$EDE, featuring the cubic Galileon operator $X\Box\phi$ and test it against the most recent Planck PR4 CMB and Cepheid calibrated Pantheon+ type Ia Supernovae data. Thanks to the kinetic braiding effects, $\mathcal{G}$EDE gives a better fit to the data, with a higher $H_0$, and is preferred over the canonical EDE with a Bayes factor $\ln B=0.9$, despite introducing one more parameter. This calls for further explorations of modified gravity near and before last scattering. To facilitate these, we introduce a substantial extension of the cosmological code \texttt{EFTCAMB} that allows to fully evolve the background and linear dynamics of any covariant theory, oscillatory or not, belonging to the Horndeski class.</description>

Abstract: In general relativity, time functions are crucial objects whose existence and properties are intimately tied to the causal structure of a spacetime and also to the initial value formulation of the Einstein equations. In this work we establish all fundamental classical existence results on time functions in the setting of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces (including causally plain continuous spacetimes, closed cone fields and even more singular spaces). More precisely, we characterize the existence of time functions by $K$-causality, show that a modified notion of Geroch's volume functions are time functions if and only if the space is causally continuous, and lastly, characterize global hyperbolicity by the existence of Cauchy time functions, and Cauchy sets. Our results thus inevitably show that no manifold structure is needed in order to obtain suitable time functions.</description>

      <title>Rapid Identification and Classification of Eccentric Gravitational Wave Inspirals with Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Current templated searches for gravitational waves (GWs) emanated from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) assume that the binaries have circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. However, certain formation channels predict that in future observing runs (O4 and beyond), a fraction of detectable binaries could enter the sensitivity band with a measurable eccentricity $e$. Constraining $e$ for each GW event with Bayesian parameter estimation methods is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This motivates the need for a machine learning based identification and classification scheme, which could weed out the majority of GW events as non-eccentric and drastically reduce the set of candidate eccentric GWs. As a proof of principle, we train a separable-convolutional neural network (SCNN) with spectrograms of synthetic GWs added to Gaussian noise characterized by O4 representative \texttt{PSD}s. We use the trained network to (i) segregate candidates as either eccentric or non-eccentric (henceforth called the detection problem) and (ii) classify the events as non-eccentric $(e = 0)$, moderately eccentric $(e \in (0, 0.2])$, and highly eccentric $(e \in (0.2, 0.5])$. On the detection problem, our best performing network detects eccentricity with $0.914$ accuracy and true and false positive rates of $0.862$ and $0.138$, respectively. On the classification problem, the best performing network classifies signals with $0.853$ accuracy. We find that our trained detector displays close to ideal behavior for the data we consider.</description>

Abstract: The current and upcoming generations of gravitational wave experiments represent an exciting step forward in terms of detector sensitivity and performance. For example, key upgrades at the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA facilities will see the next observing run (O4) probe a spatial volume around four times larger than the previous run (O3), and design implementations for e.g. the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and LISA experiments are taking shape to explore a wider frequency range and probe cosmic distances. In this context, however, a number of very real data analysis problems face the gravitational wave community. For example, it will be crucial to develop tools and strategies to analyse (amongst other scenarios) signals that arrive coincidentally in detectors, longer signals that are in the presence of non-stationary noise or other shorter transients, as well as noisy, potentially correlated, coherent stochastic backgrounds. With these challenges in mind, we develop peregrine, a new sequential simulation-based inference approach designed to study broad classes of gravitational wave signal. In this work, we describe the method and implementation, before demonstrating its accuracy and robustness through direct comparison with established likelihood-based methods. Specifically, we show that we are able to fully reconstruct the posterior distributions for every parameter of a spinning, precessing compact binary coalescence using one of the most physically detailed and computationally expensive waveform approximants (SEOBNRv4PHM). Crucially, we are able to do this using only 2% of the waveform evaluations that are required in e.g. nested sampling approaches. Finally, we provide some outlook as to how this level of simulation efficiency and flexibility in the statistical analysis could allow peregrine to tackle these current and future gravitational wave data analysis problems.</description>

Abstract: The determination of the polarization modes of gravitational waves (GWs) and their dispersion relations is a crucial task for scrutinizing the viability of extended theories of gravity. A tool to investigate the polarization states of GWs is the well-known formalism developed by Eardley, Lee, and Lightman (ELL) [Phys. Rev. D 8, 3308 (1973)] which uses the Newman-Penrose (NP) coefficients to determine the polarization content of GWs in metric theories of gravity. However, if the speed of GWs is smaller than the speed of light, the number of NP coefficients is greater than the number of polarizations. To overcome this inconvenience we use the Bardeen formalism to describe the six possible polarization modes of GWs considering general dispersion relations for the modes. The definition of a new gauge-invariant quantity enables an unambiguous description of the scalar longitudinal polarization mode. We apply the formalism to General Relativity, scalar-tensor theories, $f(R)$-gravity, and a wide class of quadratic gravity. We derive an explicit relation between a physical observable (the derivative of the frequency shift of an electromagnetic signal), and the gauge-invariant variables. Then we find an analytical formula for the pulsar timing rms response to each polarization mode. To estimate the sensitivity of a single pulsar timing we focus on the case of a dispersion relation of a massive particle. The sensitivity curves of the scalar longitudinal and vector polarization modes change significantly depending on the value of the effective mass. The detection (or absence of detection) of the polarization modes using the pulsar timing technique has decisive implications for alternative theories of gravity. Finally, investigating a cutoff frequency in the pulsar timing band can lead to a more stringent bound on the graviton mass than that presented by ground-based interferometers.</description>

Abstract: The next generation of space- and ground-based facilities promise to reveal an entirely new picture of the gravitational wave sky: thousands of galactic and extragalactic binary signals, as well as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) of unresolved astrophysical and possibly cosmological signals. These will need to be disentangled to achieve the scientific goals of experiments such as LISA, Einstein Telescope, or Cosmic Explorer. We focus on one particular aspect of this challenge: reconstructing an SGWB from (mock) LISA data. We demonstrate that simulation-based inference (SBI) - specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE) - is a promising avenue to overcome some of the technical difficulties and compromises necessary when applying more traditional methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). To highlight this, we show that we can reproduce results from traditional methods both for a template-based and agnostic search for an SGWB. Moreover, as a demonstration of the rich potential of SBI, we consider the injection of a population of low signal-to-noise ratio supermassive black hole transient signals into the data. TMNRE can implicitly marginalize over this complicated parameter space, enabling us to directly and accurately reconstruct the stochastic (and instrumental noise) contributions. We publicly release our TMNRE implementation in the form of the code saqqara.</description>

      <title>Quasibound state reminiscent in de-Sitter black holes: Quasinormal modes and the decay of massive fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive perturbations in asymptotic flat black holes leave a distinct signature in their late-time evolution `tail': an oscillatory behavior modulated by the Compton wavelength of the field, which can be associated with the so-called quasibound state spectrum. In asymptotically de-Sitter spacetimes, however, the massive perturbations always leak to the cosmological horizon, which indicates the absence of a quasibound part of the spectrum. In this work, we show that an additional mode exists in asymptotically de-Sitter black holes that produces an imprint similar to that of the quasibound states in the late-time behavior of massive scalar perturbations. If the Compton wavelength is larger than a certain critical value (which depends on the cosmological constant), the oscillatory behavior of the tail turns into an exponential decay due to the fact that the de-Sitter mode is purely imaginary. Even for black holes with typical length scales small in comparison to the size of the cosmological horizon, the late-time tail behavior of the massive perturbations is modified as compared to the usual $t^{-5/6}$ for Schwarzschild black holes, thus being a distinctive feature induced by the presence of a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Gravity as a topological gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a topological gauge theory with underlying Cartan geometry $G/H$ and principal $H$-bundle. The topological action is constructed as a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers coming from entries of the curvature $\bar{\Omega}$ of a Cartan connection.
  As an example we show that for $G = SO(4,1)$ (respectively $SO(3,2)$) for $\Lambda_0 &gt; 0$ (respectively $\Lambda_0 &lt; 0$), and $H=SO(3,1)$, a very particular linear combination yields the Holst + Euler and Pontrjagin of the curvature $R$ of the spin connection + Nieh-Yan + bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_0$ terms. Additionally, in this construction, the coupling constants of these different terms are inherently linked together.
  The other example treated is the one of the M\"obius group $G= SO(4,2) /\{\pm I\}$ and $H = CO(4,2) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. By considering a constraint on the "pair of frames" $(\alpha,\beta)$ we retrieve an action comprising all terms compatible with diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance described in the previous example + kinetic term for a scalar field $+$ an interaction of that scalar field with the Torsion $T$, the scalar field being related to dilation.
  Finally, in both examples, we study the equations of motion associated to the total (Gauge + Matter) action. It is especially shown that one of the solutions in the M\"obius case consists of Einstein's equations modified by the Holst and Nieh-Yan terms with an additional source term for curvature depending on specific variations of spin density of matter.</description>

Abstract: Our universe is permeated with interstellar plasma, which prevents propagation of low-frequency electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that two dramatic consequences arise out of such suppression; (i) if plasma permeates the light ring of a black hole, electromagnetic modes are screened entirely from the gravitational-wave signal, changing the black hole spectroscopy paradigm; (ii) if a near vacuum cavity is formed close to a charged black hole, as expected for near equal-mass mergers, ringdown "echoes" are excited. The amplitude of such echoes decays slowly and could thus serve as a silver bullet for plasmas near charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter aims to advance unexplored properties of a new class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity, reported in Universe 9, 467 (2023) and Eur.$\,$Phys.$\,$J.$\,$C 83, 626 (2023). Therein, it was shown that when the Weak Energy Condition is violated, the topology of spacetime in scalar-tensor gravity is altered, enabling the formation of two-way traversable wormholes. Furthermore, each of these wormholes acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole with cosmological constant, expressed in terms of the curvature radius, by using the approach of shadow thermodynamics and the formalism of geometrothermodynamics. We derive explicit expressions for the shadow radius in terms of the horizon, photon sphere, and observer radii. The phase transition structure turns out to strongly depend on the value of the curvature radius, including configurations with zero, one, or two phase transitions. We also analyze the black hole microscopic structure and find differences between the approaches of thermodynamic geometry and geometrothermodynamics, which are due to the presence of the curvature radius. We impose the important condition that the black hole is a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system to guarantee the consistency of the geometrothermodynamic approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we construct models of static wormholes within the framework of 4-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity an (an)isotropic energy momentum tensor (EMT) and a Maxwell field as supporting matters for the wormhole geometry assuming a constant redshift function. We obtain exact spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in 4D EGB gravity for an isotropic and anisotropic matter sources under the effect of electric charge. The solutions are more generalized in the sense of incorporating the charge contributions. Furthermore, we examine the null, weak and strong energy conditions at the wormhole throat of radius $r=r_{0}$. We demonstrate that at the wormhole throat, the classical energy conditions are violated by arbitrary small amount. Additionally, we analyze the wormhole geometry incorporating semiclassical corrections through embedding diagrams. We discover that the wormhole solutions are in equilibrium as the anisotropic and hydrostatic forces cancel each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization holonomy is analytically determined for a class of closed, spherical trajectories of light transiting a black hole in the Kerr metric. The leading order geometric optics approximation admits a closed-form expression of such paths, and sets of source/receiver locations are quantified for a spectrum of black hole angular momenta. A conserved, conformal Yano-Killing scalar is then exploited to determine the evolving polarization. Polarization holonomy, the angle between outgoing and incoming polarizations, is quantified for the spectrum of admissible direct and retrograde trajectories.</description>

      <title>The minimally extended Varying Speed of Light (meVSL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.09274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though there have been the various varying speed of light (VSL) cosmology models, they remain out of the mainstream because of their possible violation of physics laws built into fundamental physics. In order to be the VSL as a viable theory, it should inherit the success of special relativity including Maxwell equations and thermodynamics at least. Thus, we adopt that the speed of light, $\tilde c$ varies for the cosmic time not for the local time, i.e., $\tilde c[z]$ where $z$ is the cosmological redshift. When one describes the background FLRW universe, one can define the constant-time hypersurface by using physical quantities such as temperature, density, and $\tilde c$. It is because they evolve in time, and the homogeneity of the Universe demands that they must equal at the equal cosmic time. The variation of $\tilde c$ accompanies the joint variations of all related physical constants in order to satisfy the Lorentz invariance, thermodynamics, and Bianchi identity. We call this VSL model as a "minimally extended VSL (meVSL)". We derive cosmological observables of meVSL and obtain the constraints on the variation of $\tilde c$ by using the current observations. Interestingly, $z$ and all geometrical distances except the luminosity distance of meVSL are the same as those of general relativity. However, the Hubble parameter of meVSL is rescaled as $H = (1+z)^{-b/4} H^{(\rm GR)}$ which might be used as a solution for the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. In this manuscript, we provide the main effects of meVSL on various cosmological observations including BBN, CMB, SZE, BAO, SNe, GWs, H, SL, and $\Delta \alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that time's arrow is naturally induced by quantum mechanical evolution, whenever the systems have a very large number ${\cal N}$ of non-degenerate states and a Hamiltonian bounded from below. When ${\cal N}$ is finite, the arrow is imperfect, since evolution can resurrect past states. In the limit ${\cal N} \rightarrow \infty$ the arrow is fixed by the "tooth of time": the decay of excited states induced by {\it spontaneous emission} to the ground state, mediated by interactions and a large number of decay products which carry energy and information to infinity. This applies to individual isolated atoms, and does not require a coupling to a separate large heath bath.</description>

      <title>Realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in Galileon inflation and PBH overproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the explicit realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in the framework of the effective field theory of single-field Galileon inflation. The pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration hints at the scalar-induced gravity waves (SIGW) from the early universe as an explanation for the origin of the observed signal, which, however, leads to an enhancement in the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum giving rise to the overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). In the setup under consideration, we examine the generation of SIGW consistent with PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) data, in addition to which we also consider the impact from QCD crossover at the nHz frequencies and address the PBH overproduction issue assuming linear approximations for the over-density without incorporating non-Gaussian effects from the comoving curvature perturbation. The framework is shown to give rise to SIGWs well consistent with the PTA signal with comfortable PBH abundance, $10^{-3} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 1$, of near solar-mass black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Tsallis cosmology using recent low and high redshift measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Tsallis cosmology has been presented as a novel proposal for alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions. Hence a universe filled with matter and radiation as perfect fluids and considering the Tsallis entropy is confronted using recent cosmological measurements coming from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, hydrogen II galaxies, quasars, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Following a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis and combining the samples, we constrain the main characteristic parameters $\alpha = 1.031^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$ and $\delta = 1.005^{+0.001}_{-0.001}$ where the uncertainties are $1\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we estimate the current deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.530^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift $z_T=0.632^{+0.028}_{-0.028}$ and the age of the universe $\tau_U = 12.637^{+0.067}_{-0.066}\,\rm{Gyrs}$ which are in agreement with the standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) within $1.5\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that the dark energy equation of state is consistent with both phantom and quintessence behaviors within $1\sigma$ in the past and converging to $\Lambda$CDM in the future. Additionally, we find agreement values of $H_0$ within $1\sigma$ with the SH0ES values when the CMB distance priors are added to the analysis, suggesting that $H_0$ tension could be alleviated. Finally, Tsallis cosmology is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data that motives further studies at the perturbation level.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames from Top-Down Crossed Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All physical observations are made relative to a reference frame, which is a system in its own right. If the system of interest admits a group symmetry, the reference frame observing it must transform commensurately under the group to ensure the covariance of the combined system. We point out that the crossed product is a way to realize quantum reference frames from the bottom-up; adjoining a quantum reference frame and imposing constraints generates a crossed product algebra. We provide a top-down specification of crossed product algebras and show that one cannot obtain inequivalent quantum reference frames using this approach. As a remedy, we define an abstract algebra associated to the system and symmetry group built out of relational crossed product algebras associated with different choices of quantum reference frames. We term this object the G-framed algebra, and show how potentially inequivalent frames are realized within this object. We comment on this algebra's analog of the classical Gribov problem in gauge theory, its importance in gravity where we show that it is relevant for semiclassical de Sitter and potentially beyond the semiclassical limit, and its utility for understanding the frame-dependence of physical notions like observables, density states, and entropies.</description>

      <title>Bounds to strong gravity from electron-positron annihilations near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss bounds to strong gravity arising from annihilation of electron and positrons and the corresponding enhancement of the cross section for the production of massive particles. Two complementary examples are discussed, the case of the $e^+e^- \to W^+ W^-$ processes, with maximum mass and short lifetime for the particle pairs in the final state, and the case of electron positron annihilation into heavier charged lepton pairs, $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. These bounds may be improved by the next generation of electron-positron colliders, and are complementary to bounds arising from direct graviton searches.</description>
