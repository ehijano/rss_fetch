      <title>Ambient Noise Full Waveform Inversion with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation are crucial for investigating velocity structures and improving seismic hazard assessment. However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations. Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state method. Since neural operators do not involve the Born approximation, when used for full waveform inversion they have the potential to include additional phases and alleviate cycle-skipping problems present in traditional adjoint-state formulations. In this study, we demonstrate the application of neural operators for full waveform inversion on a real seismic dataset, which consists of several nodal transects collected across the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes enabled model calibration in the context of deep geological disposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep geological repositories are critical for the long-term storage of hazardous materials, where understanding the mechanical behavior of emplacement drifts is essential for safety assurance. This study presents a surrogate modeling approach for the mechanical response of emplacement drifts in rock salt formations, utilizing Gaussian Processes (GPs). The surrogate model serves as an efficient substitute for high-fidelity mechanical simulations in many-query scenarios, including time-dependent sensitivity analyses and calibration tasks. By significantly reducing computational demands, this approach facilitates faster design iterations and enhances the interpretation of monitoring data. The findings indicate that only a few key parameters are sufficient to accurately reflect in-situ conditions in complex rock salt models. Identifying these parameters is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of deep geological disposal systems.</description>

      <title>Seven decades of exploring planetary interiors with rotating convection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interiors of many planets consist mostly of fluid layers. When these layers are subject to superadiabatic temperature or compositional gradients, turbulent convection transports heat and momentum. In addition, planets are fast rotators. Thus, the key process that underpins planetary evolution, the dynamo action, flow patterns and more, is rotating convection. Because planetary interiors are inaccessible to direct observation, experiments offer physically consistent models that are crucial to guide our understanding. If we can fully understand the laboratory model, we may eventually fully understand the original. Experimentally reproducing rotating thermal convection relevant to planetary interiors comes with specific challenges, e.g. modelling the central gravity field of a planet that is parallel to the temperature gradient. Three classes of experiments tackle this challenge. One approach consists of using an alternative central force field, such as the electric force. These are, however, weaker than gravity and require going to space. Another method entails rotating the device fast enough so that the centrifugal force supersedes Earth's gravity. This mimics the equatorial regions of a planet. Lastly, by using the actual lab gravity aligned with the rotation axis, insight into the polar regions is gained. These experiments have been continuously refined during the past seven decades. We review their evolution, from the early days of visualising the onset patterns of convection, over central force field experiments in spacecrafts, liquid metal experiments, to the latest optical velocity mapping of rotating magnetoconvection in sulfuric acid inside high-field magnets. We show how innovative experimental design and emerging experimental techniques advanced our understanding and painted a more realistic picture of planetary interiors, including Earth's liquid metal outer core.</description>
