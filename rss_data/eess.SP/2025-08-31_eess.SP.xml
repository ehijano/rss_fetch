      <title>A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing (VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing (AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60% sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared to the traditional fixed-length methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Codebook Design for Localization Using Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels and similar receiver complexities.
  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED) scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further improve the CE and data detection accuracy.
  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications, interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these differences disappear.</description>

      <title>Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real datasets.</description>

      <title>Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the effectiveness of the framework through experiments.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Closed Form Model for Ultra-Wideband Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing, optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM), improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario, including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under the Creative Commons 4.0 License.</description>

      <title>Energy Detection over Composite $\kappa-\mu$ Shadowed Fading Channels with Inverse Gaussian Distribution in Ultra mMTC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device average SNR.</description>

      <title>On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii) antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile, the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular coverage.</description>

      <title>Machine Intelligence on the Edge: Interpretable Cardiac Pattern Localisation Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram (ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.</description>

      <title>A Single Subject Machine Learning Based Classification of Motor Imagery EEGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of (Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy</description>

      <title>Can Layer-wise SSL Features Improve Zero-Shot ASR Performance for Children's Speech?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech, accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64% relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of 10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the generalizability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot KWS for Children's Speech using Layer-Wise Features from SSL Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec. Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing, demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech. Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best, delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions. To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the distinct characteristics of child speakers.</description>

      <title>Remarks on stochastic cloning and delayed-state filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements, demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Faster Inference of Cell Complexes from Flows via Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21372</link>

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and computational speed.</description>

      <title>SemHARQ: Semantic-Aware Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request for Multi-Task Semantic Communications</title>

Abstract: Intelligent task-oriented semantic communications~(SemComs) have witnessed great progress with the development of deep learning~(DL), where multi-task SemComs that perform multiple tasks simultaneously attach great importance due to its high efficiency. However, the study of robust multi-task-oriented semantics transmission is still in early stages. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware hybrid automatic repeat request~(SemHARQ) framework for the robust and efficient transmissions of multi-task semantic features. First, to improve the robustness and effectiveness of semantic coding, a multi-task semantic encoder is proposed. Meanwhile, a feature importance ranking~(FIR) method is investigated to ensure the important features delivery under limited channel resources. Then, to accurately detect the possible transmission errors, a novel feature distortion evaluation~(FDE) network is designed to identify the distortion level of each feature, based on which an efficient HARQ method is proposed. Specifically, the corrupted features are retransmitted, where the remaining channel resources are used for incremental transmissions. The system performance is evaluated under different channel conditions in multi-task scenarios in the Internet of Vehicles. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art works by more than $20\%$ in rank-1 accuracy for vehicle re-identification, and $10\%$ in vehicle color classification accuracy in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.</description>

      <title>Explicit Semantic-Base-Empowered Communications for 6G Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing demands for massive data transmission pose significant challenges to communication systems. Compared with traditional communication systems that focus on the accurate reconstruction of bit sequences, SemComs, which aim to deliver information connotation, are regarded as a key technology for 6G mobile networks. Most current SemComs utilize an end-to-end trained NN for semantic extraction and interpretation, which lacks interpretability for further optimization. Moreover, NN-based SemComs assume that the application and physical layers of the protocol stack can be jointly trained, which is incompatible with current digital communication systems. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a SemCom system that employs explicit semantic bases (Sebs) as the basic units to represent semantic connotations. First, a mathematical model of Sebs is proposed to build an explicit KB. Then, the Seb-based SemCom architecture is proposed, including both a communication mode and a KB update mode to enable the evolution of communication systems. Sem-codec and channel codec modules are designed specifically, with the assistance of an explicit KB for the efficient and robust transmission of semantics. Moreover, UEP is strategically implemented, considering communication intent and the importance of Sebs, thereby ensuring the reliability of critical semantics. In addition, a Seb-based SemCom protocol stack that is compatible with the 5G protocol stack is proposed. To assess the effectiveness and compatibility of the proposed Seb-based SemComs, a case study focusing on an image-transmission task is conducted. The simulations show that our Seb-based SemComs outperform state-of-the-art works in LPIPS by over 20% under varying communication intents and exhibit robustness under fluctuating channel conditions, highlighting the advantages of the interpretability and flexibility afforded by explicit Sebs.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Receivers for Hybrid Reflecting and Sensing RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has delved into advanced designs for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with integrated sensing functions. One promising concept is the hybrid RIS (HRIS), which blends sensing and reflecting meta-atoms. This enables HRIS to process signals, aiding in channel estimation (CE) and symbol detection tasks. This paper formulates novel semi-blind receivers for HRIS-aided wireless communications that enable joint symbol and CE at the HRIS and BS. The proposed receivers exploit a tensor coding at the transmit side, while capitalizing on the multilinear structures of the received signals. We develop iterative and closed-form receiver algorithms for joint estimation of the uplink channels and symbols at both the HRIS and the BS, enabling joint channel and symbol estimation functionalities. The proposed receivers offer symbol decoding capabilities to the HRIS and ensure ambiguity-free separate CE without requiring an a priori training stage. We also study identifiability conditions that provide a unique joint channel and symbol recovery, and discuss the computational complexities and tradeoffs involved in the proposed semi-blind receivers. Our findings demonstrate the competitive performances of the proposed solutions at the HRIS and the BS and unveil distinct performance trends based on the possible combinations of HRIS-BS receiver pairs. Finally, extensive numerical results elucidate the interplay between power splitting, symbol recovery, and CE accuracy in HRIS-assisted communications. Such insights are pivotal for optimizing receiver design and enhancing system performance in future HRIS deployments.</description>

      <title>BrainGPT: Unleashing the Potential of EEG Generalist Foundation Model by Autoregressive Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are pivotal in providing insights into spontaneous brain activity, highlighting their significant importance in neuroscience research. However, the exploration of versatile EEG models is constrained by diverse data formats, outdated pre-training paradigms, and limited transfer learning methods, only leading to specialist models on single dataset. In this paper, we introduce EEGPT, the first generalist EEG foundation model designed to address these challenges. First, we propose an electrode-wise modeling strategy that treats each electrode as a fundamental unit, enabling the integration of diverse EEG datasets collected from up to 138 electrodes, amassing 37.5M pre-training samples. Second, we develop the first autoregressive EEG pre-trained model, moving away from traditional masked autoencoder approaches to a next signal prediction task that better captures the sequential and temporal dependencies of EEG data. We also explore scaling laws with model up to 1.1B parameters: the largest in EEG research to date. Third, we introduce a multi-task transfer learning paradigm using a learnable electrode graph network shared across tasks, which for the first time confirms multi-task compatibility and synergy. As the first generalist EEG foundation model, EEGPT shows broad compatibility with various signal acquisition devices, subjects, and tasks. It supports up to 138 electrodes and any combination thereof as input. Furthermore, we simultaneously evaluate it on 5 distinct tasks across 12 benchmarks. EEGPT consistently outperforms existing specialist models across all downstream tasks, with its effectiveness further validated through extensive ablation studies. This work sets a new direction for generalist EEG modeling, offering improved scalability, transferability, and adaptability for a wide range of EEG applications. The code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>Pulling Back Theorem for Generalizing the Diagonal Averaging Principle in Symplectic Geometry Mode Decomposition and Singular Spectrum Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for analyzing time sequences. The SGMD is based on the upper conversion via embedding and down conversion via diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). However, there are two defects in the DAP: it just hold for the time delay $\tau=1$ in the trajectory matrix and it fails for the time sequence of type-1 with the form $X=\{x[n]\}^N_{n=1}$. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the inverse step for embedding is explored with binary Diophantine equation in number theory. The contributions of this work lie in three aspects: firstly, the pulling back theorem is proposed and proved, which state the general formula for converting the component of trajectory matrix to the component of time sequence for the general representation of time sequence and for any time delay $\tau\ge 1$; secondly a unified framework for decomposing both the deterministic and random time sequences into multiple modes is presented and explained; finally, the guidance of configuring the time delay is suggested, namely the time delay should be selected in a limited range via balancing the efficiency of matrix computation and accuracy of state estimation. It could be expected that the pulling back theorem will help the researchers and engineers to deepen the understanding of the theory and extend the applications of the SGMD and SSA in analyzing time sequences.</description>

      <title>Tri-Hybrid Multi-User Precoding Using Pattern-Reconfigurable Antennas: Fundamental Models and Practical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of pattern-reconfigurable antennas into hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures presents a promising path toward high-efficiency and low-cost transceiver solutions. Pattern-reconfigurable antennas can dynamically steer per-antenna radiation patterns, enabling more efficient power utilization and interference suppression. In this work, we study a tri-hybrid MIMO architecture for multi-user communication that integrates digital, analog, and antenna-domain precoding using pattern-reconfigurable antennas. For characterizing the reconfigurability of antenna radiation patterns, we develop two models -- Model~I and Model~II. Model~I captures realistic hardware constraints through limited pattern selection, while Model~II explores the performance upper bound by assuming arbitrary pattern generation. Based on these models, we develop two corresponding tri-hybrid precoding algorithms grounded in the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) framework, which alternately optimize the digital, analog, and antenna precoders under practical per-antenna power constraints. Realistic simulations conducted in ray-tracing generated environments are utilized to evaluate the proposed system and algorithms. The results demonstrate the significant potential of the considered tri-hybrid architecture in enhancing communication performance and hardware efficiency. However, they also reveal that the existing hardware is not yet capable of fully realizing these performance gains, underscoring the need for joint progress in antenna design and communication theory development.</description>

      <title>mmFlux: Crowd Flow Analytics with Commodity mmWave MIMO Radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present mmFlux: a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering. This approach generates high-fidelity mmWave flow fields-compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs. In these graphs, edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence enables extraction of key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate mmFlux, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we briefly review the history of the use of radio signals to identify objects, and of the key Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) standards for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) and near-field communications that enabled broad use of these technologies in daily life. We will compare the vision for the future presented by the Auto-ID Lab in the early 21st century with the reality we see today, two decades and a little after. We will review some of the applications in which UHF RFID technology has become hugely successful, others where High Frequency Near-field Communications (HF NFC) is preferred, and applications where optical identification or active wireless communications are dominant.
  We will then examine some possible future paths for RFID technology. We anticipate that UHF read capability will become widely available for cellphones, making it as universal as NFC and Bluetooth are today. We will look at more sophisticated radio interfaces, such as multiple-antenna phased arrays for readers, and tunnel diode reflection for tags. We will discuss the integration of information from Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based image processing, barcodes, NFC and UHF tags, into a digital twin of the real environment experienced by the human user. We will examine the role of RFID with sensing in improving the management of perishable goods. The role that RFID might play in a truly circular economy, with intelligent recycling and reuse, will be discussed. Finally, we survey the many hazards and obstacles that obstruct the path to an RF-informed future.</description>

      <title>Invited Paper: Feature-to-Classifier Co-Design for Mixed-Signal Smart Flexible Wearables for Healthcare at the Extreme Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer a promising alternative to rigid silicon-based hardware for wearable healthcare devices, enabling lightweight, conformable, and low-cost systems. However, their limited integration density and large feature sizes impose strict area and power constraints, making ML-based healthcare systems-integrating analog frontend, feature extraction and classifier-particularly challenging. Existing FE solutions often neglect potential system-wide solutions and focus on the classifier, overlooking the substantial hardware cost of feature extraction and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs)-both major contributors to area and power consumption. In this work, we present a holistic mixed-signal feature-to-classifier co-design framework for flexible smart wearable systems. To the best of our knowledge, we design the first analog feature extractors in FE, significantly reducing feature extraction cost. We further propose an hardware-aware NAS-inspired feature selection strategy within ML training, enabling efficient, application-specific designs. Our evaluation on healthcare benchmarks shows our approach delivers highly accurate, ultra-area-efficient flexible systems-ideal for disposable, low-power wearable monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability, conformality, and ultra-low fabrication costs. Despite the large feature sizes in printed electronics, printed neural networks have attracted attention for meeting target application requirements, though realizing complex circuits remains challenging. This work bridges the gap between classification accuracy and area efficiency in printed neural networks, covering the entire processing-near-sensor system design and co-optimization from the analog-to-digital interface-a major area and power bottleneck-to the digital classifier. We propose an automated framework for designing printed Ternary Neural Networks with arbitrary input precision, utilizing multi-objective optimization and holistic approximation. Our circuits outperform existing approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average, being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5% accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.</description>

Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for decomposing time series, which is based on the diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Although the authors of SGMD method generalized the form of the trajectory matrix in SSA, the DAP is not updated simultaneously. In this work, we pointed out the limitations of the SGMD method and fixed the bugs with the pulling back theorem for computing the given component of time series from the corresponding component of trajectory matrix.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Nonconvex Factorization Approach for Tensor Train Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Endmember Extraction from Hyperspectral Images Using Self-Dictionary Approach with Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. A key step in utilizing this technology is endmember extraction, which aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials in observed scenes. Theoretical studies suggest that self-dictionary methods using linear programming (LP), known as Hottopixx methods, are effective in extracting endmembers. However, their practical application is hindered by high computational costs, as they require solving LP problems whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. As a result, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced implementation of Hottopixx designed to reduce computational time and improve endmember extraction performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The results suggest that our implementation enables the application of Hottopixx for endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and allows us to achieve reasonably high accuracy in estimating endmember signatures.</description>
