      <title>Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of solitons (or "soliton gas'') by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these solitons; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the soliton data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the soliton locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian integrable systems from constant non-invertible solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct invertible spectral parameter dependent Yang-Baxter solutions ($R$-matrices) by Baxterizing constant non-invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. The solutions are algebraic (representation independent). They are constructed using supersymmetry (SUSY) algebras. The resulting $R$-matrices are regular leading to local non-hermitian Hamiltonians written in terms of the SUSY generators. As particular examples we Baxterize the $4\times 4$ constant non-invertible solutions of Hietarinta leading to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians. On comparing with the literature we find two of the models are new. Apart from being non-hermitian, many of them are also non-diagonalizable with interesting spectrums. With appropriate representations of the SUSY generators we obtain spin chains in all local Hilbert space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of recurrence and spectral asymmetry of the two-component Akhmediev breathers in a single mode optical fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of experimental studies of recurrent spectral dynamics of the two component Akhmediev breathers (ABs) in a single mode optical fibre. We also provide the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the ABs based on the two component Manakov equations that confirm the experimental data. In particular, we observed spectral asymmetry of fundamental ABs and complex spectral evolution of second-order nondegenerate ABs.</description>

      <title>Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>
