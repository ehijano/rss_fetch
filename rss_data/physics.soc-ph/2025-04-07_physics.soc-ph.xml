      <title>Input to European Strategy Update for Particle Physics: Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity continues to have an enormous negative impact on the ability of the planet to sustain human and other forms of life. Six out of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed, a seventh is close to threshold. Prominent manifestations of this development are climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, as well as loss of biodiversity. In recognition of the urgency of these problems, several international agreements have been ratified to achieve net-zero emissions and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Significant reductions in emissions are required by 2030 to meet international climate targets. The field of particle physics has an obligation and an opportunity to contribute to such mitigation efforts and to avoid causing further harm. This document urges the European Strategy Update in Particle Physics to set a clear and bold mandate for embedding environmental sustainability throughout the future scientific programme, and advocates for a series of actions that will enable this.</description>

      <title>Connected components in networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of defining connected components in hypergraphs, which are models for systems with higher-order interactions. For graphs with dyadic interactions, connected components are defined in terms of paths connecting nodes along the graph. However, defining connected components in hypergraphs is a more involved problem, as one needs to consider the higher-order nature of the interactions associated with the hyperedge. Higher-order interactions can be taken into consideration through a logic associated with the hyperedges, two examples being OR-logic and AND-logic; these logical operations can be considered two limiting cases corresponding to non-cooperative and fully cooperative interactions, respectively. In this paper we show how connected components can be defined in hypergraphs with OR or AND logic. While OR-logic and AND-logic provide the same connected components for nondirected hypergraphs, for directed hypergraphs the strongly connected component of AND-logic is a subset of the OR-logic strongly connected component. Interestingly, higher-order interactions change the general topological properties of connected components in directed hypergraphs. Notably, while for directed graphs the strongly connected component is the intersection of its in- and out-component, in hypergraphs with AND-logic the intersection of in- and out-component does not equal the strongly connected component. We develop a theory for the fraction of nodes that are part of the largest connected component and through comparison with real-world data we show that degree-cardinality correlations play a significant role.</description>

      <title>The Vaccination Game on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccinations are an important tool in the prevention of disease. Vaccinations are generally voluntary for each member of a population and vaccination decisions are influenced by individual risk perceptions and contact structures within populations. In this study, we model vaccination uptake as an evolutionary game where individuals weigh perceived morbidity risks from both vaccination and infection. We incorporate epidemiological dynamics using an SIR model structured on networks, allowing us to determine the evolutionarily stable vaccination level for any given network topology. Our analysis shows that vaccination coverage varies across networks depending on their structure and the relative cost of vaccination (the ratio of vaccine morbidity risk to infection morbidity risk). As this cost increases, vaccination uptake decreases universally, leading to a dominant non-vaccinator strategy when the cost is high. We find that networks with low to moderate degree variability have a relatively low evolutionarily stable vaccination level when this cost is low, as in such populations lower vaccination levels are necessary to achieve equivalent levels of disease prevalence to more heterogeneous networks with high degree variability, which thus show higher vaccination levels at lower relative costs. However, for heterogeneous networks, vaccination levels decline faster as costs rise, eventually falling below the level for the more homogeneous networks. Our findings align with previous studies on vaccination thresholds in structured populations and highlight how network heterogeneity influences vaccination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ethics Readiness of Technology: The case for aligning ethical approaches with technological maturity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ethics of emerging technologies faces an anticipation dilemma: engaging too early risks overly speculative concerns, while engaging too late may forfeit the chance to shape a technology's trajectory. Despite various methods to address this challenge, no framework exists to assess their suitability across different stages of technological development. This paper proposes such a framework. I conceptualise two main ethical approaches: outcomes-oriented ethics, which assesses the potential consequences of a technology's materialisation, and meaning-oriented ethics, which examines how (social) meaning is attributed to a technology. I argue that the strengths and limitations of outcomes- and meaning-oriented ethics depend on the uncertainties surrounding a technology, which shift as it matures. To capture this evolution, I introduce the concept of ethics readiness: the readiness of a technology to undergo detailed ethical scrutiny. Building on the widely known Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), I propose Ethics Readiness Levels (ERLs) to illustrate how the suitability of ethical approaches evolves with a technology's development. At lower ERLs, where uncertainties are most pronounced, meaning-oriented ethics proves more effective, while at higher ERLs, as impacts become clearer, outcomes-oriented ethics gains relevance. By linking Ethics Readiness to Technology Readiness, this framework underscores that the appropriateness of ethical approaches evolves alongside technological maturity, ensuring scrutiny remains grounded and relevant. Finally, I demonstrate the practical value of this framework by applying it to quantum technologies, showing how Ethics Readiness can guide effective ethical engagement.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of atmospheric transport and dispersion of Phakopsora pachyrhizi urediniospores in South America using the state of Paran\'a-Brazil as a model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phakopsora pachyrhizi is a biotrophic fungus that requires living plant tissue to survive in the wild for extended periods. The fungus causes Asian rust and costs billions of US dollars every year for its control in South American soy production. Despite the regulatory measure that prohibits the cultivation of soybeans in some months of the year (soybean-free period) in Brazil, the presence of soybean production areas in neighboring countries, such as Paraguay and Bolivia, can help the survival of the pathogen between crop seasons. It is known that P. pachyrhizi urediniospores can be spread/transported thousands of kilometres by the wind. In this context, the objective of this work was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the atmospheric transport of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores from the west, Paraguay/Bolivia to Paran\'a Brazil, through storms coming from cold fronts. The transport of urediniospores was modeled by a diffusive-convective-reactive equation. Wind direction and the velocity of cold fronts that crossed Paran\'a state between October 2018 and February 2019 were used. For validation, real cases of rust occurrence in the Paran\'a state informed by the Anti-rust Consortium Portal in the season 2018/19 were used. The results confirm mathematically that urediniospores from infected areas located in a country on the west can be transported and deposited on the east, in the state of Paran\'a. The first case of soybean rust in Paran\'a state/Brazil was registered 10 days after the first cold front, suggesting that the transported and deposited urediniospores were still viable for host infection. This work reinforces the importance of the establishment of the soybean-free period in other soybean-producing countries. It will also provide a better understanding of the fungus dispersion system, potentially enabling the correct use of fungicides.</description>

      <title>Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast 2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach based on the use of complex networks to analyze the structure and content of curricula. We analyze the concept network built from the final year of a particular high school Physics curriculum, as well as that of Mathematics. We examine the most central nodes in each case, the community structures (coherent units or groupings), and the changes that occurred when the network was considered in isolation or integrated with Mathematics. The results show that the integrated Physics and Mathematics network has a higher average degree compared to the individual networks, driven by numerous interdisciplinary connections. The modularity analysis indicates similarities with the original curriculum layout, but also interesting differences that may suggest alternative ways of organizing the content. The differences between separated and integrated networks also highlights the prominence of certain key concepts.</description>
