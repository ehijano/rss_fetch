      <title>Machine learning models for predicting catastrophe bond coupons using climate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the growing frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased the need for effective tools to manage catastrophe risk. Catastrophe (CAT) bonds allow the transfer of part of this risk to investors, offering an alternative to traditional reinsurance. This paper examines the role of climate variability in CAT bond pricing and evaluates the predictive performance of various machine learning models in forecasting CAT bond coupons. We combine features typically used in the literature with a new set of climate indicators, including Oceanic Ni{\~n}o Index, Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Pacific-North American pattern, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Oscillation Index, and sea surface temperatures. We compare the performance of linear regression with several machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, gradient boosting, extremely randomized trees, and extreme gradient boosting. Our results show that including climate-related variables improves predictive accuracy across all models, with extremely randomized trees achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE). These findings suggest that large-scale climate variability has a measurable influence on CAT bond pricing and that machine learning methods can effectively capture these complex relationships.</description>

      <title>Tradable Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0009042</link>
      <description>arXiv:cond-mat/0009042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we present a new approach to the numerical valuation of derivative securities. The method is based on our previous work where we formulated the theory of pricing in terms of tradables. The basic idea is to fit a finite difference scheme to exact solutions of the pricing PDE. This can be done in a very elegant way, due to the fact that in our tradable based formulation there appear no drift terms in the PDE. We construct a mixed scheme based on this idea and apply it to price various types of arithmetic Asian options, as well as plain vanilla options (both european and american style) on stocks paying known cash dividends. We find prices which are accurate to $\sim 0.1%$ in about 10ms on a Pentium 233MHz computer and to $\sim 0.001%$ in a second. The scheme can also be used for market conform pricing, by fitting it to observed option prices.</description>
