      <title>Existence of 2-EFX Allocations of Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible chores among agents with additive disutility functions. We investigate the existence of allocations satisfying the popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX), and its multiplicative approximations. The existence of $4$-EFX allocations was recently established by Garg, Murhekar, and Qin (2025). We improve this guarantee by proving the existence of $2$-EFX allocations for all instances with additive disutilities. This approximation was previously known only for restricted instances such as bivalued disutilities (Lin, Wu, and Zhou (2025)) or three agents (Afshinmehr, Ansaripour, Danaei, and Mehlhorn (2024)).
  We obtain our result by providing a general framework for achieving approximate-EFX allocations. The approach begins with a suitable initial allocation and performs a sequence of local swaps between the bundles of envious and envied agents. For our main result, we begin with an initial allocation that satisfies envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and Pareto-optimality (PO); the existence of such an allocation was recently established in a major breakthrough by Mahara (2025). We further demonstrate the strength and generality of our framework by giving simple and unified proofs of existing results, namely (i) $2$-EFX for bivalued instances, (ii) 2-EFX for three agents, (iii) EFX when the number of chores is at most twice the number of agents, and (iv) $4$-EFX for all instances. We expect this framework to have broader applications in approximate-EFX due to its simplicity and generality.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Equity-Aware P2P Energy Trading Framework for Socio-Economically Diverse Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants. Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles, which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access. This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt, continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency, Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair energy communities.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Symmetric Bimatrix Games with Common Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study symmetric bimatrix games that also have the common-payoff property, i.e., the two players receive the same payoff at any outcome of the game. Due to the symmetry property, these games are guaranteed to have symmetric Nash equilibria, where the two players play the same (mixed) strategy. While the problem of computing such symmetric equilibria in general symmetric bimatrix games is known to be intractable, namely PPAD-complete, this result does not extend to our setting. Indeed, due to the common-payoff property, the problem lies in the lower class CLS, ruling out PPAD-hardness. In this paper, we show that the problem remains intractable, namely it is CLS-complete. On the way to proving this result, as our main technical contribution, we show that computing a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a quadratic program remains CLS-hard, even when the feasible domain is a simplex.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Double Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auctions are important mechanisms extensively implemented in various markets, e.g., search engines' keyword auctions, antique auctions, etc. Finding an optimal auction mechanism is extremely difficult due to the constraints of imperfect information, incentive compatibility (IC), and individual rationality (IR). In addition to the traditional economic methods, some recently attempted to find the optimal (single) auction using deep learning methods. Unlike those attempts focusing on single auctions, we develop deep learning methods for double auctions, where imperfect information exists on both the demand and supply sides. The previous attempts on single auction cannot directly apply to our contexts and those attempts additionally suffer from limited generalizability, inefficiency in ensuring the constraints, and learning fluctuations. We innovate in designing deep learning models for solving the more complex problem and additionally addressing the previous models' three limitations. Specifically, we achieve generalizability by leveraging a transformer-based architecture to model market participants as sequences for varying market sizes; we utilize the numerical features of the constraints and pre-treat them for a higher learning efficiency; we develop a gradient-conflict-elimination scheme to address the problem of learning fluctuation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach to classical and machine learning baselines.</description>
