      <title>LO-SDA: Latent Optimization for Score-based Atmospheric Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) plays a pivotal role in numerical weather prediction by systematically integrating sparse observations with model forecasts to estimate optimal atmospheric initial condition for forthcoming forecasts. Traditional Bayesian DA methods adopt a Gaussian background prior as a practical compromise for the curse of dimensionality in atmospheric systems, that simplifies the nonlinear nature of atmospheric dynamics and can result in biased estimates. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative DA method, LO-SDA. First, a variational autoencoder is trained to learn compact latent representations that disentangle complex atmospheric correlations. Within this latent space, a background-conditioned diffusion model is employed to directly learn the conditional distribution from data, thereby generalizing and removing assumptions in the Gaussian prior in traditional DA methods. Most importantly, we introduce latent optimization during the reverse process of the diffusion model to ensure strict consistency between the generated states and sparse observations. Idealized experiments demonstrate that LO-SDA not only outperforms score-based DA methods based on diffusion posterior sampling but also surpasses traditional DA approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a diffusion-based DA method demonstrates the potential to outperform traditional approaches on high-dimensional global atmospheric systems. These findings suggest that long-standing reliance on Gaussian priors-a foundational assumption in operational atmospheric DA-may no longer be necessary in light of advances in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Hybrid Physics-AI Coupled Ocean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate simulations, at all grid resolutions, rely on approximations that encapsulate the forcing due to unresolved processes on resolved variables, known as parameterizations. Parameterizations often lead to inaccuracies in climate models, with significant biases in the physics of key climate phenomena. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are now directly enabling the learning of unresolved processes from data to improve the physics of climate simulations. Here, we introduce a flexible framework for developing and implementing physics- and scale-aware machine learning parameterizations within climate models. We focus on the ocean and sea-ice components of a state-of-the-art climate model by implementing a spectrum of data-driven parameterizations, ranging from complex deep learning models to more interpretable equation-based models. Our results showcase the viability of AI-driven parameterizations in operational models, advancing the capabilities of a new generation of hybrid simulations, and include prototypes of fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice hybrid simulations. The tools developed are open source, accessible, and available to all.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Model Representation of Two Contrasting Extreme Precipitation Events in the Sahel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two extreme flood-inducing precipitation events in two cities in Mali, on 08 August 2012 in San (127 mm) and on 25 August 2019 in Kenieba (126 mm), are investigated with respect to rainfall structures, dynamical forcings, and the ability of the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model to represent their evolution. Two sets of experiments with convective parameterization enabled (PARAM) and disabled (EXPLC), both at 6.5 km grid spacing, are conducted for each case. While the (thermo)dynamical fields of the simulations are compared with ERA5 reanalysis data, the rainfall fields are tested against the satellite-based precipitation dataset IMERG by applying the spatial verification methods Fractions Skill Score (FSS) and the Structure-Amplitude-Location (SAL) score. In addition, a spectral filtering of tropical waves is applied to investigate their impact on the extreme events. The most prominent results are: (1) Both cases were caused by organized convective systems associated with a westward propagating cyclonic vortex, but differ in their environmental setting. Although both cases featured an east African wave (AEW), the San case involved convective enhancement along dry Saharan airmasses, whereas the Kenieba case occurred within an unusual widespread wet environment extending deep into the Sahel. (2) Although EXPLC captures the rainfall distribution in the San case better than PARAM, it fails to organize convection in the moisture-laden Kenieba case, which PARAM is capable of simulating. (3) The FSS confirms the case-dependency of the ICON skill. The SAL method hints towards a systematic deficiency of EXPLC to represent the convective organization by producing too many scattered and weak rainfall systems, while PARAM is more effective in converting abundant moisture into excessive rainfall.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Guided AI Cascaded Corrector Model Significantly Extends Madden-Julian Oscillation Prediction Skill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks. Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate correlation &gt; 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the "Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation &gt; 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent, computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.</description>

      <title>Geographic Transferability of Machine Learning Models for Short-Term Airport Fog Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility &lt; 1.0 km) presents challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost) trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a 2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE), San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of 0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes (radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed, coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable atmospheric forecasting tools.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Climate Change on Photovoltaic Potential in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Africa holds the world's highest solar irradiance yet has &lt;2% of global photovoltaic (PV) capacity, leaving 600 million people without electricity access. However, climate change impacts on its 10 TW potential remain understudied. Using four decades of ERA5 reanalysis data (1980-2020) at 0.25 degree resolution, we quantify the contributions of key climate factors to historical changes in African PV potential through multivariate decomposition. Continental PV potential increased by 3.2%, driven primarily by enhanced solar radiation (+1.2 degree Celsius, contributing -23%). East Africa gained &gt;6% from radiation enhancement, while North Africa declined by 0.5% as extreme heat (+2 degree Celsius) overwhelmed radiation benefits. Critically, stability analysis using the coefficient of variation (CV) reveals that high-irradiance subtropical zones are highly variable (CV=0.4), in contrast to stable equatorial regions (CV=0.1), challenging the assumption that resource abundance ensures reliability. These findings reframe Africa's solar strategy: North Africa requires prioritizing heat-resilient technology over capacity maximization; subtropical zones demand grid-storage co-investment; and East Africa presents globally competitive opportunities for rapid, stable deployment. By resolving spatiotemporal heterogeneities and quantifying climate-driver contributions, our analysis provides an actionable framework for climate-resilient solar deployment, critical for Africa's energy transition and climate mitigation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Graph Networks for Accurate Weather Forecasting via Lightweight Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure. Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends, weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Atmospheric Models Reliably Simulate Out-of-Sample Land Heat and Cold Wave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over 1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960). Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during 1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.</description>
