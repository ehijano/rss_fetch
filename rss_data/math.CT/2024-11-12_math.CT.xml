      <title>The Classification of Fusion 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify (multi)fusion 2-categories in terms of braided fusion categories and group cohomological data. This classification is homotopy coherent -- we provide an equivalence between the 3-groupoid of (multi)fusion 2-categories up to monoidal equivalences and a certain 3-groupoid of commuting squares of $\mathrm{B}\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant spaces. Rank finiteness and Ocneanu rigidity for fusion 2-categories are immediate corollaries of our classification.</description>

      <title>Double groupoids and $2$-groupoids in regular Mal'tsev categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ of internal $2$-groupoids is a Birkhoff subcategory of the category $ \mathrm{Grpd}^2(\mathscr{C}) $ of double groupoids in a regular Mal'tsev category $\mathscr{C}$ with finite colimits. In particular, when $\mathscr{C}$ is a Mal'tsev variety of universal algebras, the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ is also a Mal'tsev variety, of which we describe the corresponding algebraic theory. When $\mathscr{C}$ is a naturally Mal'tsev category, the reflector from $ \mathrm{Grpd}^2(\mathscr{C}) $ to 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ has an additional property related to the commutator of equivalence relations. We prove that the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ is semi-abelian when $\mathscr{C}$ is semi-abelian, and then provide sufficient conditions for 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ to be action representable.</description>

      <title>On definable subcategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a skeletally small additive category. Using the canonical equivalence between two different presentations of the free abelian category over $\mathcal{X}$, we give a new and simple characterization of definable subcategories of $\rm Mod\text{-}\mathcal{X}$, and in particular definable subcategories of modules over rings. In the end, we give a conceptual proof of Auslander-Gruson-Jensen duality, which makes the duality between definable subcategories of left and right module more transparent.</description>

      <title>The internal languages of univalent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal language theorems are fundamental in categorical logic, since they express an equivalence between syntax and semantics. One of such theorems was proven by Clairambault and Dybjer, who corrected the result originally by Seely. More specifically, they constructed a biequivalence between the bicategory of locally Cartesian closed categories and the bicategory of democratic categories with families with extensional identity types, $\sum$-types, and $\prod$-types. This theorem expresses that the internal language of locally Cartesian closed is extensional Martin-L\"of type theory with dependent sums and products. In this paper, we study the theorem by Clairambault and Dybjer for univalent categories, and we extend it to various classes of toposes, among which are $\prod$-pretoposes and elementary toposes. The results in this paper have been formalized using the proof assistant Coq and the UniMath library.</description>

      <title>Topoi of automata I: Four topoi of automata and regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both topos theory and automata theory are known for their multi-faceted nature and relationship with topology, algebra, logic, and category theory. This paper aims to clarify the topos-theoretic aspects of automata theory, particularly demonstrating through two main theorems how regular (and non-regular) languages arise in topos-theoretic calculation. First, it is shown that the four different notions of automata form four types of Grothendieck topoi, illustrating how the technical details of automata theory are described by topos theory. Second, we observe that the four characterizations of regular languages (DFA, Myhill-Nerode theorem, finite monoids, profinite words) provide Morita-equivalent definitions of a single Boolean-ringed topos, situating this within the context of Olivia Caramello's 'Toposes as Bridges.'
  This paper also serves as a preparation for follow-up papers, which deal with the relationship between hyperconnected geometric morphisms and algebraic/geometric aspects of formal language theory.</description>

      <title>Categorical representation of DRC-semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DRC-semigroups model associative systems with domain and range operations, and contain many important classes, such as inverse, restriction, Ehresmann, regular $*$-, and $*$-regular semigroups. In this paper we show that the category of DRC-semigroups is isomorphic to a category of certain biordered categories whose object sets are projection algebras in the sense of Jones. This extends the recent groupoid approach to regular $*$-semigroups of the first and third authors. We also establish the existence of free DRC-semigroups by constructing a left adjoint to the forgetful functor into the category of projection algebras.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of algebras captured by actions of weak Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of well-established results regarding symmetries of $\Bbbk$-algebras, where $\Bbbk$ is a field. Traditionally, for a $\Bbbk$-algebra $A$, the group $\Bbbk$-algebra automorphisms of $A$ captures the symmetries of $A$ via group actions. Similarly, the Lie algebra of derivations of $A$ captures the symmetries of $A$ via Lie algebra actions. In this paper, given a category $\mathcal{C}$ whose objects possess $\Bbbk$-linear monoidal categories of modules, we introduce an object $\operatorname{Sym}_{\mathcal{C}}(A)$ that captures the symmetries of $A$ via actions of objects in $\mathcal{C}$. Our study encompasses various categories whose objects include groupoids, Lie algebroids, and more generally, cocommutative weak Hopf algebras. Notably, we demonstrate that for a positively graded non-connected $\Bbbk$-algebra $A$, some of its symmetries are naturally captured within the weak Hopf framework.</description>

      <title>Parametricity via Cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametricity is a key metatheoretic property of type systems, which implies strong uniformity &amp; modularity properties of the structure of types within systems possessing it. In recent years, various systems of dependent type theory have emerged with the aim of expressing such parametric reasoning in their internal logic, toward the end of solving various problems arising from the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence conditions in type theory. This paper presents a first step toward the unification, simplification, and extension of these various methods for internalizing parametricity. Specifically, I argue that there is an essentially modal aspect of parametricity, which is intimately connected with the category-theoretic concept of cohesion. On this basis, I describe a general categorical semantics for modal parametricity, develop a corresponding framework of axioms (with computational interpretations) in dependent type theory that can be used to internally represent and reason about such parametricity, and show this in practice by implementing these axioms in Agda and using them to verify parametricity theorems therein. I then demonstrate the utility of these axioms in managing the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence by deriving induction principles for higher inductive types, and in closing, I sketch the outlines of a more general synthetic theory of parametricity, with applications in domains ranging from homotopy type theory to the analysis of program modules.</description>
