      <title>Spaceability of sets of non-injective maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing a recent result on lineability of sets of non-injective linear operators, we prove, for quite general linear spaces $A$ of maps from an arbitraty set to a sequence space, that, for every $0 \neq f \in A$, the subset of $A$ of non-injective maps contains an infinite dimensional subspace of $A$ containing $f$. We provide aplications of the main result to spaces of linear operators between quasi-Banach spaces, to spaces of linear operators belonging to an operator ideal, and, in the nonlinear setting, to linear spaces of homogeneous polynomials and to linear spaces of vector-valued Lispshitz functions on metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of finite and infinite dimensional Fresnel integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full characterization of the class of Fresnel integrable functions is an open problem in functional analysis, with significant applications to mathematical physics (Feynman path integrals) and the analysis of the Schr\"odinger equation. In finite dimension, we prove the Fresnel integrability of functions in the Sj\"ostrand class $M^{\infty,1}$ - a family of continuous and bounded functions, locally enjoying the mild regularity of the Fourier transform of an integrable function. This result broadly extends the current knowledge on the Fresnel integrability of Fourier transforms of finite complex measures, and relies upon ideas and techniques of Gabor wave packet analysis. We also discuss the problem of designing infinite-dimensional extensions of this result, obtaining the first, non-trivial concrete realization of a general framework of projective functional extensions introduced by Albeverio and Mazzucchi. As an interesting byproduct, we obtain the exact $M^{\infty,1} \to L^\infty$ operator norm of the free Schr\"odinger evolution operator.</description>

      <title>Relationships between Global and Local Monotonicity of Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to establishing relationships between global and local monotonicity, as well as their maximality versions, for single-valued and set-valued mappings between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces. We first show that for single-valued operators with convex domains in locally convex topological spaces, their continuity ensures that their global monotonicity agrees with the local one around any point of the graph. This also holds for set-valued mappings defined on the real line under a certain connectedness condition. The situation is different for set-valued operators in multidimensional spaces as demonstrated by an example of locally monotone operator on the plane that is not globally monotone. Finally, we invoke coderivative criteria from variational analysis to characterize both global and local maximal monotonicity of set-valued operators in Hilbert spaces to verify the equivalence between these monotonicity properties under the closed-graph and global hypomonotonicity assumptions.</description>

      <title>On Monadic Vector-Valued Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, there has been a growing interest in a structuralist understanding of probability, measure and integration theory. The present thesis contributes to this programme in three ways. First, we construct a commutative probability monad on the cartesian closed category of hk-spaces (also known as CGWH spaces, or weak Hausdorff k-spaces in the literature). Secondly, in order to achieve this in a seamless way, we develop the theory of paired linear hk-spaces, a functional-analytic category tailored to the duality between measures and functionals. Finally, vector-valued integration emerges naturally from the free-forgetful adjunction between paired linear hk-spaces and hk-spaces, inducing a commutative monad of compactly supported measures and leading to a theory of monadic vector-valued integration.</description>

      <title>On Fock covariance for product systems and the reduced Hao-Ng isomorphism problem by discrete actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of equivariant Fock covariant injective representations for product systems. We show that this characterisation coincides with Nica covariance for compactly aligned product systems over right LCM semigroups of Kwa\'{s}niewski and Larsen, and with the Toeplitz representations of a discrete monoid of Laca and Sehnem. By combining with the framework established by Katsoulis and Ramsey, we resolve the reduced Hao-Ng isomorphism problem for generalised gauge actions by discrete groups.</description>

      <title>Free Zero Bias and Infinite Divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (classical) zero bias is a transformation of centered, finite variance probability distributions, often expressed in terms of random variables $X\mapsto X^\ast$, characterized by the functional equation \[ E[Xf(X)] = \sigma^2 E[f'(X^\ast)] \quad \text{for all }\; f\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}) \] where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of $X$. The zero bias distribution is always absolutely continuous, and supported on the convex hull of the support of $X$. It is related to Stein's method, and has many applications throughout probability and statistics, most recently finding new characterization of infinite divisiblity and relation to the L\'evy--Khintchine formula.
  In this paper, we define a free probability analogue, the {\em free zero bias} transform $X\mapsto X^\circ$ acting on centered $L^2$ random variables, characterized by the functional equation \[ E[Xf(X)] = \sigma^2 E[\partial f(X^\circ)] \quad \text{for all }\; f\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}) \] where $\partial f$ denotes the free difference quotient. We prove existence of this transform, and show that it has comparable smoothness and support properties to the classical zero bias. Our main theorem is an analogous characterization of free infinite divisibility in terms of the free zero bias, and a new understanding of free L\'evy measures. To achieve this, we develop several new operations on Cauchy transforms of probability distributions that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Small Ball Probabilities for Simple Random Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the small ball probability of an order-$\ell$ simple random tensor $X=X^{(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes X^{(\ell)}$ where $X^{(i)}, 1\leq i\leq\ell$ are independent random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are log-concave or have independent coordinates with bounded densities. We show that the probability that the projection of $X$ onto an $m$-dimensional subspace $F$ falls within an Euclidean ball of length $\varepsilon$ is upper bounded by $\frac{\varepsilon}{(\ell-1)!}\left(C\log\left(\frac{e}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)^{\ell}$ and also this upper bound is sharp when $m$ is small. We also established that a much better estimate holds true for a random subspace.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$ spreading models and the FPP for Ces\`aro mean nonexpansive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty set in a Banach space $X$. A mapping $T\colon K\to K$ is called {\it $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive} if for any sequence $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ and $y$ in $K$, one has $\|(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n Tx_i -Ty\|\leq \|(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - y\|$. As a subsclass of nonexpansive maps, the FPP for such maps is well-established in a great variety of spaces. The main result of this paper is a fixed point result relating $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansiveness, $\ell_1$ spreading models and Schauder bases with not-so-large basis constants. As a result, we deduce that every Banach space with weak Banach-Saks property has the fixed point property for $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive maps.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Dual-Blind Deconvolution for Joint Radar-Communications via SoMAN Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In joint radar-communications (JRC) applications such as secure military receivers, often the radar and communications signals are overlaid in the received signal. In these passive listening outposts, the signals and channels of both radar and communications are unknown to the receiver. The ill-posed problem of recovering all signal and channel parameters from the overlaid signal is termed as \textit{dual-blind deconvolution} (DBD). In this work, we investigate DBD for a multi-antenna receiver. We model the radar and communications channels with a few (sparse) \textit{continuous-valued} parameters such as time delays, Doppler velocities, and directions-of-arrival (DoAs). To solve this highly ill-posed DBD, we propose to minimize the sum of multivariate atomic norms (SoMAN) that depend on unknown parameters. To this end, we devise an exact semidefinite program using theories of positive hyperoctant trigonometric polynomials (PhTP). Our theoretical analyses show that the minimum number of samples and antennas required for perfect recovery is logarithmically dependent on the maximum of the number of radar targets and communications paths rather than their sum. We show that our approach is easily generalized to include several practical issues such as gain/phase errors and additive noise. Numerical experiments show the exact parameter recovery for different JRC scenarios.</description>
