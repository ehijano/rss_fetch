      <title>Unifying topological entropy notions for piecewise continuous maps on the interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the definition of topological entropy given by Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew (AKM) for piecewise continuous self-maps defined on a compact interval (pc-maps). For this notion of entropy, we prove that the properties of the AKM-entropy in the compact-continuous setting get naturally extended, including that it can be estimated using Bowen's formula disregarding the metric used to compute it. Additionally, for piecewise strictly monotonic pc-maps, we prove that the Misiurewicz-Szlenk formula based on the asymptotic behavior of the number of monotony pieces for iterations of the map coincides with our notion of topological entropy. In this way, we unify the notions of entropy commonly used for piecewise continuous interval maps, proving that they all coincide when the space is compact.</description>

      <title>Melnikov Method for Perturbed Completely Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a completely integrable system of differential equations in arbitrary dimensions whose phase space contains an open set foliated by periodic orbits. This research analyzes the persistence and stability of the periodic orbits under a nonlinear periodic perturbation. For this purpose, we use the Melnikov method and Floquet theory to establish conditions for the existence and stability of periodic orbits. Our approach considers periods of the unperturbed orbits depending on the integrals and constant periods. In the applications, we deal with both cases. Precisely, we study the existence of periodic orbits in a perturbed generalized Euler system. In the degenerate case, we analyze the existence and stability of periodic orbits for a perturbed harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Periodic boundary points for simply connected Fatou components of transcendental maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let f be a transcendental map, and let U be an attracting or parabolic basin, or a doubly parabolic Baker domain. Assume U is simply connected. Then, we prove that periodic points are dense in the boundary of U, under certain hypothesis on the postsingular set. This generalizes a result by F. Przytycki and A. Zdunik for rational maps. Our proof uses techniques from measure theory, ergodic theory, conformal analysis, and inner functions. In particular, a result on the distortion of inner functions near the unit circle is provided, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the equivalence of two possible definitions of a rotational interval exchange transformation: by the first one, it is a first return map for a circle rotation onto a union of finite number of circle arcs, and by the second one, it is an interval exchange with a scheme (in the sense of interval rearrangement ensembles), whose dual is an interval exchange scheme as well.</description>

      <title>When time delays and phase lags are not the same: higher-order phase reduction unravels delay-induced synchronization in oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled oscillators with time-delayed network interactions are critical to understand synchronization phenomena in many physical systems. Phase reductions to finite-dimensional phase oscillator networks allow for their explicit analysis. However, first-order phase reductions - where delays correspond to phase lags - fail to capture the delay-dependence of synchronization. We develop a systematic approach to derive phase reductions for delay-coupled oscillators to arbitrary order. Already the second-order reduction can predict delay-dependent (bi-)stability of synchronized states as demonstrated for Stuart-Landau oscillators.</description>

      <title>Oscillation of ergodic averages and other stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ergodic map $T$ and a non-constant, real-valued $f \in L^1$, the ergodic averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x) = \frac{1} {N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(T^n x)$ converge a.e., but the convergence is never monotone. Depending on particular properties of the function $f$, the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ may or may not actually oscillate around the mean value infinitely often a.e. We will prove that a.e. oscillation around the mean is the generic behavior. That is, for a fixed ergodic $T$, the generic non-constant $f\in L^1$ has the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ oscillating around the mean infinitely often for almost every $x$. We also consider oscillation for other stochastic processes like subsequences of the ergodic averages, convolution operators, weighted averages, uniform distribution and martingales. We will show that in general, in these settings oscillation around the limit infinitely often persists as the generic behavior.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for Green metrics on hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the first author and Tanaka obtained a large deviation principle comparing two Green metrics on a non-elementary hyperbolic group $\Gamma$ associated to finitely supported, admissable probability measures. The aim of this article is to prove the corresponding central limit theorem. Furthermore, our results apply to various other metrics including length functions associated to Anosov representations and to group actions on hyperbolic metric spaces.
  In the particular case that $\Gamma$ is the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic manifold our work provides a statistical characterisation for the hitting measure of a finitely supported random walk being in the same class as the Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the spectral gap property for random walks on the product of two non-locally isomorphic analytic real or p-adic compact groups with simple Lie algebras, under the necessary condition that the marginals posses a spectral gap. Furthermore, we give additional control on the spectral gap depending on certain specific properties of the given groups and marginals; in particular, we prove some new cases of the super-approximation conjecture. One ingredient of the proof is a local Ulam stability result which is introduced and proved in this paper. This result characterizes partially defined almost homomorphisms between two analytic compact groups with simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents of renewal equations: numerical approximation and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for computing the Lyapunov exponents of renewal equations (delay equations of Volterra type), consisting first in applying a discrete QR technique to the associated evolution family suitably posed on a Hilbert state space and second in reducing to finite dimension each evolution operator in the obtained time sequence. The reduction to finite dimension relies on Fourier projection in the state space and on pseudospectral collocation in the forward time step. A rigorous proof of convergence of both the discretized operators and the approximated exponents is provided. A MATLAB implementation is also included for completeness.</description>

      <title>Statistical convex-cocompactness for mapping class groups of non-orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a finite volume deformation retract $\mathcal{T}_{\varepsilon_t}^{-}(\mathcal{N}_g)/\mathrm{MCG}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ of non-orientable surfaces $\mathcal{N}_g$ behaves like the convex core of $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{N}_g)$, despite not even being quasi-convex. We then show that geodesics in the convex core leave compact regions with exponentially low probabilities, showing that the action of $\mathrm{MCG}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ on $\mathcal{T}_{\varepsilon_t}^{-}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ is statistically convex-cocompact. Combined with results of Coulon and Yang, this shows that the growth rate of orbit points under the mapping class group action is purely exponential, pseudo-Anosov elements in mapping class groups of non-orientable surfaces are exponentially generic, and the action of mapping class group on the limit set in the horofunction boundary is ergodic with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. A key step of our proof relies on complexity length, developed by Dowdall and Masur, which is an alternative notion of distance on Teichm\"uller space that accounts for geodesics that spend a considerable fraction of their time in the thin part.</description>

Abstract: Using a Picard-like operator $T$, we prove that the iterative differential equation $-\gamma g' = g^{-1}$ with parameter $\gamma&gt;0$ has a solution $g=h\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$ for only one value $\gamma=\kappa\approx0.278877$, and that this solution $h$ is unique. As an even stronger result, we exhibit $h$ as the global limit of the operator $T$.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time of Open Quantum Systems via Hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mixing of open quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and quantum information science. Existing approaches for estimating the mixing time often rely on the spectral gap estimation of the Lindbladian generator, which can be challenging to obtain in practice. We propose a novel theoretical framework to estimate the mixing time of open quantum systems that treats the Hamiltonian and dissipative part separately, thus circumventing the need for a priori estimation of the spectral gap of the full Lindbladian generator. The technique is based on the construction of an energy functional inspired by the hypocoercivity of (classical) kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Steiner trees with infinitely many terminals on the sides of an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean Steiner problem is the problem of finding a set $St$, with the shortest length, such that $St \cup A$ is connected, where $A$ is a given set in a Euclidean space. The solutions $St$ to the Steiner problem will be called Steiner sets while the set $A$ will be called input. Since every Steiner set is acyclic we call it Steiner tree in the case when it is connected. We say that a Steiner tree is indecomposable if it does not contain any Steiner tree for a subset of the input.
  We are interested in finding the Steiner set when the input consists of infinitely many points distributed on two lines. In particular we would like to find a configuration which gives an indecomposable Steiner tree.
  We consider a self-similar input, namely the set $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ of points with coordinates $(\lambda^{k-1}\cos \alpha,$ $\pm \lambda^{k-1}\sin \alpha)$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are small fixed values. These points are distributed on the two sides of an angle of size $2\alpha$ in such a way that the distances from the points to the vertex of the angle are in a geometric progression.
  To our surprise, we show that in this case the solutions to the Steiner problem for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$, when $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are small enough, are always decomposable trees. More precisely, any Steiner tree for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ is a countable union of Steiner trees, each one connecting 5 points from the input. By considering only a finite number of components we obtain many solutions to the Steiner problem for finite sets composed of $4k+1$ points distributed on the two lines ($2k+1$ on a line and $2k$ on the other line). These solutions are very similar to the ladders of Chung and Graham.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new concept of interval rearrangement ensembles (IRE), which is a generalization of interval exchange transformations (IET). This construction expands the space of IETs in accordance with the natural duality that we pinpoint. Induction of Rauzy\,--\,Veech kind is applicable to IREs. It is conjugate to the reverse operation by the duality mentioned above. A natural extension of an IRE is associated with two transversal flows on a flat translation surface with branching points.</description>

      <title>To Define the Core Entropy for All Polynomials Having a Connected Julia Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical core entropy for a post critically finite (PCF) polynomial f with deg(f)&gt;1 is defined to be the topological entropy of f restricted to its Hubbard tree. We fully generalize this notion by a new quantity, called the (general) core entropy, which is well defined whenever f has a connected Julia set. If f is PCF, the core entropy equals the classical version. If two polynomials are J-equivalent they share the same core entropy. If f is renormalizable there is a direct connection between the core entropy of f and that corresponding to the small Julia set. We also analyze the map that sends every parameter c in the Mandelbrot set to the core entropy of the polynomial z^2+c. In particular, the level set of this entropy map at log2 is of full harmonic measure and the Mandelbrot set is locally connected at each point in this level set.</description>

Abstract: Delay Gronwall inequality with a weakly singular kernel has been a subject of interest in various mathematical studies. In this article, we will delve into the consideration of this inequality and its application in the study continuity of the state trajectory for a Volterra integral equation with delay. Using delay Gronwall inequality with a singular kernel, we investigate the behavior and properties of the state trajectory if there are delays. This analysis aims to improve our understanding of the dynamics associated in del Volterra integral equations with delay. In addition, we present a comprehensive example demonstrating the practical significance of our results.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions for Stochastic Systems and Safety-critical Control Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08728v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the analysis of a control barrier function has received considerable attention because it is helpful for the safety-critical control required in many control application problems. While the extension of the analysis to a stochastic system studied by many researchers, it remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we consider sufficient conditions for reciprocal and zeroing control barrier functions ensuring safety with probability one and design a control law using the functions. Then, we propose another version of a stochastic zeroing control barrier function to evaluate a probability of a sample path staying in a safe set and confirm the convergence of a specific expectation related to the attractiveness of a safe set. We also show a way of deisgning a safety-critical control law based on our stochastic zeroing control barrier function. Finally, we confirm the validity of the proposed control design and the analysis using the control barrier functions via simple examples with their numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Training neural operators to preserve invariant measures of chaotic attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems make long-horizon forecasts difficult because small perturbations in initial conditions cause trajectories to diverge at an exponential rate. In this setting, neural operators trained to minimize squared error losses, while capable of accurate short-term forecasts, often fail to reproduce statistical or structural properties of the dynamics over longer time horizons and can yield degenerate results. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework designed to preserve invariant measures of chaotic attractors that characterize the time-invariant statistical properties of the dynamics. Specifically, in the multi-environment setting (where each sample trajectory is governed by slightly different dynamics), we consider two novel approaches to training with noisy data. First, we propose a loss based on the optimal transport distance between the observed dynamics and the neural operator outputs. This approach requires expert knowledge of the underlying physics to determine what statistical features should be included in the optimal transport loss. Second, we show that a contrastive learning framework, which does not require any specialized prior knowledge, can preserve statistical properties of the dynamics nearly as well as the optimal transport approach. On a variety of chaotic systems, our method is shown empirically to preserve invariant measures of chaotic attractors.</description>

      <title>The unbounded Lagrangian spectral norm and wrapped Floer cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the question of whether the spectral metric on the orbit space of a fiber in the disk cotangent bundle of a closed manifold, under the action of the compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group, is bounded. We utilize wrapped Floer cohomology to define the spectral invariant of an admissible Lagrangian submanifold within a Weinstein domain. We show that the pseudo-metric derived from this spectral invariant is a valid $Ham$-invariant metric. Furthermore, we establish that the spectral metric on the orbit space of an admissible Lagrangian is bounded if and only if the wrapped Floer cohomology vanishes. Consequently, we prove that the Lagrangian Hofer diameter of the orbit space for any fiber in the disk cotangent bundle of a closed manifold is infinite.</description>

      <title>Zeta functions of dynamically tame Liouville domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a dynamical zeta function for nondegenerate Liouville domains, in terms of Reeb dynamics on the boundary. We use filtered equivariant symplectic homology to (i) extend the definition of the zeta function to a more general class of "dynamically tame" Liouville domains, and (ii) show that the zeta function of a dynamically tame Liouville domain is invariant under exact symplectomorphism of the interior. As an application, we find examples of open domains in R^4, arbitrarily close to a ball, which are not symplectomorphic to open star-shaped toric domains.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>
