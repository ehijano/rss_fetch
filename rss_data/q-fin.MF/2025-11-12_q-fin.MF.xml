      <title>Levy-stable scaling of risk and performance functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a finite-horizon model in which liquid-asset returns exhibit Levy-stable scaling on a data-driven window [tau_UV, tau_IR] and aggregate into a finite-variance regime outside. The window and the tail index alpha are identified from the log-log slope of the central body and a two-segment fit of scale versus horizon. With an anchor horizon tau_0, we derive horizon-correct formulas for Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, Sharpe and Information ratios, Kelly under a Value-at-Risk constraint, and one-step drawdown, where each admits a closed-form Gaussian-bias term driven by the exponent gap (1/alpha - 1/2). The implementation is nonparametric up to alpha and fixed tail quantiles. The formulas are reproducible across horizons on the Levy window.</description>

      <title>Forecasting implied volatility surface with generative diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for generating arbitrage-free implied volatility (IV) surfaces, offering a more stable and accurate alternative to existing GAN-based approaches. To capture the path-dependent nature of volatility dynamics, our model is conditioned on a rich set of market variables, including exponential weighted moving averages (EWMAs) of historical surfaces, returns and squared returns of underlying asset, and scalar risk indicators like VIX. Empirical results demonstrate our model significantly outperforms leading GAN-based models in capturing the stylized facts of IV dynamics. A key challenge is that historical data often contains small arbitrage opportunities in the earlier dataset for training, which conflicts with the goal of generating arbitrage-free surfaces. We address this by incorporating a standard arbitrage penalty into the loss function, but apply it using a novel, parameter-free weighting scheme based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that dynamically adjusts the penalty's strength across the diffusion process. We also show a formal analysis of this trade-off and provide a proof of convergence showing that the penalty introduces a small, controllable bias that steers the model toward the manifold of arbitrage-free surfaces while ensuring the generated distribution remains close to the real-world data.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Strategies for Singular Dividend Control Problems under the Mean-Variance Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal dividend problem of de Finetti by adding a variance term to the usual criterion of maximizing the expected discounted dividends paid until ruin, in a singular control framework. Investors do not like variability in their dividend distribution, and the mean-variance (MV) criterion balances the desire for large expected dividend payments with small variability in those payments. The resulting MV singular dividend control problem is time-inconsistent, and we follow a game-theoretic approach to find a time-consistent equilibrium strategy. Our main contribution is a new verification theorem for the novel dividend problem, in which the MV criterion is applied to an integral of the control until ruin, a random time that is endogenous to the problem. We demonstrate the use of the verification theorem in two cases for which we obtain the equilibrium dividend strategy (semi-)explicitly, and we provide a numerical example to illustrate our results.</description>
