      <title>Nonstationary polarization optical forces, considering the influence of dispersion and diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the dynamic properties of an attractive longitudinal optical force and the applied potential, due to diffraction and dispersion of ultrashort laser pulses, propagating in air at distances of several diffraction and dispersion lengths, are presented. The results are based on an analytical solution of the linear 3D+1 paraxial amplitude equation and its application to the evolution in time of the longitudinal optical force. The current research provides valuable guidance for the development and creation of neutral particle laser accelerators with potential applications in the field of laser driven nuclear fusion.</description>

      <title>Second-harmonic stabilization of a bulk photonic resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonant modes of optical cavities provide a powerful resource for laser-frequency stabilization, underpinning high-precision metrology and coherent signal generation. Photonic resonators in which the optical mode propagates through material offer a compact alternative to vacuum Fabry-Perot cavity systems, but their performance is limited by sensitivity of the material to the ambient environment. In this work, we explore second-harmonic (SH) stabilization, which exploits the interplay of a dispersive mode structure against the strict energy conservation of second-harmonic generation. Operationally, we use two, 1550 nm lasers to PDH-detect octave-spaced resonant modes of an ultra-high-Q photonic resonator with one laser frequency-doubled to 775 nm. Under SH stabilization, the microwave frequency offset between the 1550 nm lasers, which we refer to as the SH signal ($f_{SH}$) maps the absolute frequency of the 1550 nm laser to an electronic signal. We characterize this mapping through comparison of the absolute optical frequency inference provided by $f_{SH}$ to an out-of-loop optical measurement, and our results suggest $f_{SH}$ accurately proxies frequency drift. We evaluate the sensitivity and noise floor of this technique, considering contributions from laser locking and bulk material properties, and conclude that $f_{SH}$ is sufficiently sensitive to enhance long-term laser-frequency stability with respect to the resonator. These results demonstrate SH stabilization as a useful technique that infers absolute drift, thereby enabling the increased stability of future compact, precision frequency references.</description>

      <title>Reaching the quantum noise limit for interferometric measurement of optical nonlinearity in vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics predicts that the vacuum must behave as a nonlinear optical medium:the vacuum optical index should increase when vacuum is stressed by intense electromagnetic fields.The DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) project aims to measure it by using intense and ultra-short laser pulses delivered by the LASERIX facility at IJCLab (Paris-Saclay University). Theprinciple is to measure by interferometry the deflection of a low-intensity probe pulse when crossingthe vacuum optical index gradient produced by an external high-intensity pump pulse. The detectionof the expected signal requires measuring the position of the interference intensity profile with a highspatial resolution, limited by the ultimate quantum noise. However, the spatial resolution is highlydegraded by the phase noise induced by the mechanical vibrations of the interferometer. In order tosuppress this interferometric phase noise, we have developed a new method, named High-FrequencyPhase Noise Suppression (HFPNS) method, based on the use of a delayed reference signal to correctany noise-related signal appearing in the probe beam. In this work, we present the experimentalvalidation of this novel method. The results demonstrate a robust path toward picometer-scalesensitivity and provide a key step toward the observation of QED-induced vacuum refraction.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian curved space via inverted wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverting design method of solving passive graded materials from predefined amplitude and phase was developed along the line of transformation optics (TO), which however precludes the presence of source and sink in the pragmatic world. So in this Letter we extend such an inverse method to non-Hermitian media, offering more freedom to manipulate the wave flows. Our principle of a curved-space analogue picture powered with gain and loss, is exemplified by three types: amplitude controlling, phase conversion, and direction shunting. Our numeric examples showcase precise wave manipulation in a surprisingly simple manner, which goes beyond convectional paradigms of TO and is readily implementable in realistic photonic platform.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Sensor for Laser Beams Based on Reweighted Amplitude Flow Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reference-free computational wavefront sensor based on binary amplitude modulation and phase retrieval. The method employs Digital Micro-mirror Device as a programmable amplitude modulator and reconstructs the complex optical field from multiple far-field intensity measurements using the Reweighted Amplitude Flow algo-rithm with Optimal Spectral Initialization. Unlike classical pupil-plane wavefront sen-sors, the proposed architecture does not include any wavelength-specific optical elements, enabling straightforward adaptation across a broad spectral range. The achievable spatial resolution of the reconstructed wavefront is scalable with the modulator resolution. We experimentally demonstrate wavefront reconstruction at 650 nm and at 2116 nm, where commercial wavefront sensors are not widely available. The reconstructed wavefront is validated against a commercial lateral shearing interferometer at 650 nm, and the method is further integrated into a closed-loop adaptive optics system using a deformable mirror. The approach is particularly suited for applications requiring high spatial resolution and large dynamic range in slowly varying or quasi-static laser fields, where computational reconstruction speed is not of the primary concern.</description>

      <title>Coherent Virtual Absorption in Dielectric Slabs: A Temporal Analysis of Symmetric and Asymmetric Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent virtual absorption refers to time-limited storage of optical energy in lossless configurations due to excitation of a complex zero frequency through proper temporal engineering of the incident wave. Given the dynamics underlying the effect and the storage-release mechanism occurring for finite excitation pulses, studying and understanding the associated time dynamics are crucial for enabling future applications. In this work, we carefully investigate this phenomenon in symmetric and asymmetric geometries, shedding light on practical considerations in situations when a closed-form analytical solution is not readily available. Combinations of time domain analysis and spectral filtering are used to enable systematic analysis of these structures. Our approach can be generalized to more complex structures, including multilayered and inhomogeneous cases, providing new opportunities for optimized energy storage and advanced sensing applications utilizing complex-frequency dynamics in lossless designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the problem of blind source separation and its applications to imaging. We first establish a theoretical result that we stated in our previous article on imaging in diffusive environments. This result is a generalization of separability criteria found in the literature to arbitrary correlated complex-valued sources with additive noise. In a second step, we verify these separability conditions in two propagation regimes frequently encountered in imaging: the speckle regime and the random geometrical optics regime. Finally, we propose a new imaging method based on the blind source separation problem that improves on images obtained with the classical decomposition of the time reversal operator method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical quantum networking protocols impose stringent requirements on the states produced by sources of entanglement. We demonstrate a free-space, compact, source of indistinguishable pairs of polarization entangled photons, with an integrated local oscillator reference as a significant step towards this goal. This source achieves $(99.11 \pm 0.01)\%$ polarization entanglement visibility, $(96.3 \pm 0.6)\%$ successive-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility, $(68.0 \pm 0.1)\%$ heralded efficiency as detected, and $(88.6 \pm 0.2)\%$ interference visibility with a local oscillator. This simultaneous achievement of state-of-the-art metrics demonstrates an adaptable platform for quantum networking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors provide a unique materials platform in which long-range magnetic order coexists with strongly bound excitons. Because excitonic states and magnetic moments originate from the same electronic orbitals and are coupled through intrinsic exchange interactions, optical excitations in these systems exhibit pronounced sensitivity to magnetic order. Recent experiments have revealed unusually strong magneto-optical responses, as well as direct coupling between excitons and magnons, establishing new routes for controlling light-matter interactions with spin degrees of freedom. This Review surveys key developments in the field, focusing on representative material systems, experimental signatures of exciton-magnetism coupling, and the theoretical frameworks used to describe these phenomena. We conclude with perspectives on how this rapidly evolving field could enable next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies leveraging the coupled dynamics of light, charge, and spin.</description>

      <title>Pseudorotation and N-body Forces in an Optical Matter System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM "kite" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., "teardrop"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.</description>

      <title>Strong-field Driven Sub-cycle Band Structure Modulation and Dephasing Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, ultrafast electron dynamics in the solid state have been extensively studied using various strong light-matter interaction techniques, such as high-harmonic generation. These studies lead to multiple interpretations of light-matter interaction in the strong-field regime, with exact mechanisms not yet fully understood. It is well known that strong-field interaction with a crystalline solid leads to significant modification of its band structure and, hence, its optical properties on ultrafast timescales. In this work, we present measurements of ultrafast electric-field observables in magnesium oxide using a non-resonant nonlinear optical interaction. Using field observables, we show that strong laser fields modulate the band structure on sub-cycle timescales, thereby altering the material's nonlinear optical response. We perform time-dependent perturbation theory calculations using a field-dependent dispersion relation and non-perturbative semiconductor Bloch equation calculations, both of which agree with experimental observations. Furthermore, we directly extract dephasing times from the real-time signal electric field envelope and show sub-cycle control of dephasing times. Our work offers a new perspective on strong-field-driven electron dynamics in solids through electric-field observables. The demonstrated attosecond modulation of the nonlinear response could have important implications for quantum light generation and quantum spectroscopy using nonlinear optical processes.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Switch Using an Array of Subwavelength Metallic Holes-coupled-disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broadband switching of terahertz waves at room temperature is demonstrated using a reconfigurable subwavelength metallic hole coupled disk array. The interaction between a metallic membrane featuring periodically arranged circular holes and a substrate bearing a correspondingly periodic array of metallic disks - precisely aligned at their centers - significantly enhances the light coupling within each individual metallic structure, leading to an improved optical transmission and the appearance of a new transmission peak. By mechanical displacement of the metallic membrane with respect to the substrate with metallic disks, the light transmission through the structure can be reconfigured. The device exhibits a polarization-insensitive high-contrast switching performance of 89.4 dB at 942 GHz. The full-width at half-maximum bandwidth of the switch is 288 GHz. By proper design of the device's geometric dimensions, the operation frequency and bandwidth of the switch can be scaled.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Evanescent-Field Atom Guides on Optical Nanofiber Testbeds for Benchmarking Membrane-Waveguide Photonic Integrated Circuit Platforms Toward On-Chip Quantum Inertial Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold atom interferometry with atom guides have set the stage for miniaturized quantum inertial sensors capable of operating in dynamic environments. In this work, we combine three key innovations - evanescent-field (EF) atom guides, optical nanofiber (NF) testbeds, and membrane-waveguide photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platforms - to advance EF-guided atom interferometry. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of EF atom guides on optical NF testbeds, providing a mean to benchmark membrane-waveguide PIC platforms. Second, we achieve low-power (~5 mW) guiding of freely moving, laser-cooled 133Cs atoms in two-color, traveling-wave EF optical dipole traps at the magic wavelengths of 793 nm and 937 nm - referred to here as 793/937-nm EF atom guides - in contrast to conventional 685/937-nm standing-wave EF optical lattices. The 793/937-nm EF atom guides map directly onto the membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, which can safely handle up to 4-6x times the minimum trap power under vacuum and enable dense cold atom generation for efficient loading into the EF atom guides. Third, we verify preserved atomic coherence via microwave fields and EF-coupled Doppler-free Raman beams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coherence fringes driven by co-propagating EF-coupled Raman beams with only 150 nW of total optical power. By forging a direct link between optical NF testbeds to membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, our results lay critical groundwork for the on-chip realization of EF-guided atom interferometry and for fully integrated, low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) quantum accelerometers and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Single-Emitter Spectra from an Ensemble</title>

Abstract: The heterogeneity in nanoscale emitters hinders efforts to understand their basic photophysics and limits their use in practical applications. Existing methods have difficulty accurately characterizing single-emitter spectra and optical heterogeneity on a statistical scale. Here, we introduce SPICEE (SPectrally Imbalanced Correlations from Ensemble Emission), a spectrally filtered photon-correlation technique that recovers single-particle emission lineshapes from an ensemble sample. Analytical derivations, numerical modeling, and experiments on a solution ensemble of emitters validate the technique. We apply SPICEE to blue-emitting ZnSeTe semiconductor nanocrystals relevant to display applications and find that the low color purity in the ensemble spectrum is primarily caused by a small subpopulation of nanocrystals with a distinct emission mechanism. This work demonstrates that SPICEE is a powerful high-throughput tool for accurately characterizing the single-emitter properties of nanoscale systems.</description>
