      <title>An Algorithm for Discriminating the Complete Multiplicities of a Parametric Univariate Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the parametric complete multiplicity problem for a univariate polynomial. Our approach to the parametric complete multiplicity problem has a significant difference from the classical method, which relies on repeated gcd computation. Instead, we introduce a novel technique that uses incremental gcds of the given polynomial and its high-order derivatives. This approach, formulated as non-nested subresultants, sidesteps the exponential expansion of polynomial degrees in the generated condition. We also uncover the hidden structure between the incremental gcds and pseudo-remainders. Our analysis reveals that the conditions produced by our new algorithm are simpler than those generated by the classical approach in most cases. Experiments show that our algorithm is faster than the one based on repeated gcd computation for problems with relatively big size.</description>

      <title>Computing with D-Algebraic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence is difference algebraic (or D-algebraic) if finitely many shifts of its general term satisfy a polynomial relationship; that is, they are the coordinates of a generic point on an affine hypersurface. The corresponding equations are called algebraic difference equations (ADE). We show that subsequences of D-algebraic sequences, indexed by arithmetic progressions, satisfy ADEs of the same orders as the original sequences. Additionally, we provide algorithms for operations with D-algebraic sequences and discuss the difference-algebraic nature of holonomic and $C^2$-finite sequences.</description>

      <title>A Qualitative Analysis of Kernel Extension for Higher Order Proof Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the sake of reliability, the kernels of Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) are generally kept relatively small. On top of the kernel, additional symbols and inference rules are defined. This paper presents an analysis of how kernel extension reduces the size of proofs and impacts proof checking.</description>

      <title>ArgMed-Agents: Explainable Clinical Decision Reasoning with LLM Disscusion via Argumentation Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning. Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes. This leads to user distrust. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction. ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Discussion (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, use symbolic solver to identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision. We construct a formal model of ArgMed-Agents and present conjectures for theoretical guarantees. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</description>
