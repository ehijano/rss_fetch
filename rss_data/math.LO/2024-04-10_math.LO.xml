      <title>On cardinal invariants related to Rosenthal families and large-scale topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a function $f \in \omega^\omega$, a set $A \in [\omega]^\omega$ is free for $f$ if $f[A] \cap A$ is finite. For a class of functions $\Gamma \subseteq \omega^{\omega}$, we define $\mathfrak{ros}_\Gamma$ as the smallest size of a family $\mathcal{A}\subseteq [\omega]^\omega$ such that for every $f\in\Gamma$ there is a set $A \in \mathcal{A}$ which is free for $f$, and $\Delta_\Gamma$ as the smallest size of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\Gamma$ such that for every $A\in[\omega]^\omega$ there is $f\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $A$ is not free for $f$. We compare several versions of these cardinal invariants with some of the classical cardinal characteristics of the continuum. Using these notions, we partially answer some questions from arXiv:1911.01336 [math.LO] and arXiv:2004.01979 [math.GN].</description>

      <title>A note on continuous functions on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous functions on the unit interval are relatively tame from the logical and computational point of view. A similar behaviour is exhibited by continuous functions on compact metric spaces equipped with a countable dense subset. It is then a natural question what happens if we omit the latter 'extra data', i.e. work with 'unrepresented' compact metric spaces. In this paper, we study basic third-order statements about continuous functions on such unrepresented compact metric spaces in Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics. We establish that some (very specific) statements are classified in the (second-order) Big Five of Reverse Mathematics, while most variations/generalisations are not provable from the latter, and much stronger systems. Thus, continuous functions on unrepresented metric spaces are 'wild', though 'more tame' than (slightly) discontinuous functions on the reals.</description>

      <title>Dilators and the reverse mathematics zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A predilator is a particularly uniform transformation of linear orders. We have a dilator when the transformation preserves well-foundedness. Over the theory $\mathsf{ACA}_0$ from reverse mathematics, any $\Pi^1_2$-formula is equivalent to the statement that some predilator is a dilator. We show how this completeness result breaks down without arithmetical comprehension: over $\mathsf{RCA}_0+\mathsf{PA}$, the statements from a large part of the reverse mathematics zoo are not equivalent to some predilator being a dilator.</description>

      <title>On the theory of exponential integer parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We axiomatize the first-order theories of exponential integer parts of real-closed exponential fields in a language with $2^x$, in a language with a predicate for powers of 2, and in the basic language of ordered rings. In particular, the last theory extends IOpen by sentences expressing the existence of winning strategies in a certain game on integers; we show that it is a proper extension of IOpen, and give upper and lower bounds on the required number of rounds needed to win the game.</description>

      <title>Quasiorders for a characterization of iso-dense spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A (generalized) topological space is called an iso-dense space if the set of all its isolated points is dense in the space. The main aim of the article is to show in $\mathbf{ZF}$ a new characterization of iso-dense spaces in terms of special quasiorders. For a non-empty family $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of a set $X$, a quasiorder $\lesssim_{\mathcal{A}}$ on $X$ determined by $\mathcal{A}$ is defined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{A}$ are given to have the property that the topology consisting of all $\lesssim_{\mathcal{A}}$-increasing sets coincides with the generalized topology on $X$ consisting of the empty set and all supersets of non-empty members of $\mathcal{A}$. The results obtained, applied to the quasiorder $\lesssim_{\mathcal{D}}$ determined by the family $\mathcal{D}$ of all dense sets of a given (generalized) topological space, lead to a new characterization of non-trivial iso-dense spaces. Independence results concerning resolvable spaces are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Librationist cum classical set theories</title>

Abstract: A librationist set theory \pounds ${}$ is developed. It descends from semantics for truth, initiated by by Kripke, Herzberger, Gupta and others. # extends the system \pounds, of Librationist closures of the paradoxes in Logic and Logical Philosophy 21(4), 323-361, 2012. The focus is upon the paradoxes in theories of sets. A central result is that the extension #$\mathscr{HR}(\mathbf{D})$, of #, accounts for $\mathbf{NBG}$ set theory, with the global Axiom of Choice and Tarski's Axiom. Moreover, # also succeeds with defining an impredicative manifestation set $\mathbf{W}$, $\mathit{die \ Welt}$, so that #$\mathscr{H}(\mathbf{W})$ accounts for Quine's $\mathbf{NF}$. Nevertheless, the points of view developed support the view that the truth-paradoxes and the set-paradoxes have common origins, so that the librationist resolutions of the set theoretic paradoxes at the same time are resolutions of the truth theoretic paradoxes. Both the librationist resolutions of the set theoretic paradoxes and the truth theoretic paradoxes have non-trivial implications: librationist set theories have the consequence that there are no absolutely uncountable sets, and librationist truth theories allow the use of syntactical modalities in ways which circumvent well known limitations, first pointed out by Montague in 1963. So librationism has a truth predicate which is useful for more precise discourse, and # retains the ideology of the author's 2012 article, that the set theoretic universe is countable. But the set within which $\mathbf{NBG}$ is interpreted "believes" that there are sets which are uncountable. The situation is analyzed much as by Skolem, though it is not suggested that the notion of $\mathit{set}$ is imprecise: for the bijection from the set of finite von Neumann ordinals to the full universe is not a member of a classical set theory.</description>

      <title>On inverse Goodstein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the late 1980s, Abrusci, Girard and van de Wiele defined a variant of Goodstein sequences: the so-called inverse Goodstein sequence. In their work, they show that it terminates precisely at the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. This reveals that a proof of this fact requires substantial consistency strength. Moreover, the authors could show that sequences of this kind terminate even if the hereditary base change at the heart of their construction is replaced by a generalization using arbitrary dilators. It has been a conjecture by Andreas Weiermann that this more general result has a connection to Bachmann-Howard fixed points and is, therefore, equivalent to one of the most famous strong set existence principles from reverse mathematics: $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension. In this article, we prove this conjecture to be correct. Moreover, we show that the ordinal at which such sequences terminate is, in a fundamental way, isomorphic to the $1$-fixed point of their dilator, a new concept introduced by Freund and Rathjen. This yields explicit notation systems and a general method for specifying such ordinals. Also, using the notation systems provided by $1$-fixed points, we can reproduce the result that the Goodstein sequence terminates at the Bachmann-Howard ordinal in a weak system. Additionally, we perform a similar computation for a variant of Goodstein sequences, which terminates at a predicative ordinal.</description>

Abstract: We describe two systems currently being developed that use large language models for the automatized correction of (i) exercises in translating back and forth between natural language and the languages of propositional logic and first-order predicate logic and (ii) exercises in writing simple arguments in natural language in non-mathematical scenarios. </description>
