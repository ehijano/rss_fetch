      <title>Growth Problems for Representations of Finite Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a conjecture for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of indecomposable summands in the tensor powers of representations of finite monoids, expressing it in terms of the (Brauer) character table of the monoid's group of units. We prove it under an additional hypothesis. We also give (exact and asymptotic) formulas for the growth rate of the length of the tensor powers when working over a good characteristic. As examples, we compute the growth rates for the full transformation monoid, the symmetric inverse monoid, and the monoid of 2 by 2 matrices. We also provide code used for our calculation.</description>

      <title>Rewriting modulo in diagrammatic algebras and application to categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rewriting theory suitable for diagrammatic algebras and lay down the foundations of a systematic study of their higher structures. In this paper, we focus on the question of finding bases. As an application, we give the first proof of a basis theorem for graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams, a certain diagrammatic algebra appearing in categorification and quantum topology. Our approach is algorithmic, combining linear rewriting, higher rewriting and rewriting modulo another set of rules -- for diagrammatic algebras, the modulo rules typically capture a categorical property, such as pivotality. In the process, we give novel approaches to the foundations of these theories, including to the notion of confluence. Other important tools include termination rules that depend on contexts, rewriting modulo invertible scalars, and a practical guide to classifying branchings modulo. This article is written to be accessible to experts on diagrammatic algebras with no prior knowledge on rewriting theory, and vice-versa.</description>

      <title>Invariant Kernels: Rank Stabilization and Generalization Across Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry arises often when learning from high dimensional data. For example, data sets consisting of point clouds, graphs, and unordered sets appear routinely in contemporary applications, and exhibit rich underlying symmetries. Understanding the benefits of symmetry on the statistical and numerical efficiency of learning algorithms is an active area of research. In this work, we show that symmetry has a pronounced impact on the rank of kernel matrices. Specifically, we compute the rank of a polynomial kernel of fixed degree that is invariant under various groups acting independently on its two arguments. In concrete circumstances, including the three aforementioned examples, symmetry dramatically decreases the rank making it independent of the data dimension. In such settings, we show that a simple regression procedure is minimax optimal for estimating an invariant polynomial from finitely many samples drawn across different dimensions. We complete the paper with numerical experiments that illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>On the Boson-Fermion Correspondence for Factorial Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an algebraic (non-analytic) proof of the deformed boson-fermion Fock space construction of Molev's double supersymmetric Schur functions, among other results, from our previous paper. In other words, we make no assumptions on the variables and parameters. By specializing to a finite number of variables and shifting parameters, we recover the factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, we realize the bosonic construction through a representation of a completion of the infinite rank general linear Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all representations of the Kac-Moody algebras with characters being modular forms. For the Kac-Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ we calculate the Zagier-Zwegers' polar-finite decomposition for admissible characters with string functions being mock modular coefficients of the finite part. These admissible string functions were realized by Ahn, Chung, and Tye as the characters of the generalized Fateev-Zamolodchikov parafermionic theories. Using our new polar-finite decomposition, we obtain families of mock theta conjecture-like identities parametrized by spin for $1/3$ and $2/3$-level string functions in terms of the Ramanujan's classical mock theta functions $f_3(q)$ and $\omega_3(q)$. We also obtain an analogous family of identities for the $1/5$-level string functions in terms of Ramanujan's four tenth-order mock theta functions. Finally, we give a heuristic argument for a refined expansion of the general positive admissible-level string function in terms of Appell functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A.A. Suslin proved a normality theorem for an elementary linear group and V.I. Kopeiko extended this result of Suslin for a symplectic group defined with respect to the standard skew-symmetric matrix of even size. We generalized the result of Kopeiko for a symplectic group defined with respect to any invertible skew-symmetric matrix of Pfaffian one. Vaserstein group is an extension of a symplectic group defined with respect to any invertible skew-symmetric matrix of Pfaffian one in the set up of projective modules. Here we prove a normality theorem for Vaserstein group.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r$, the random $2r$--regular Schreier graphs depicting the action of $r$ random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ are a.a.s. weakly Ramanujan, for any $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{12}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random matrices in irreducible representations of $S_{n}$ of quasi--exponential dimension.
  We also give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories. Their \emph{lengths} yield invariants for these categories. We then focus on composition series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. We construct composition series of different lengths, for some smooth projective rational surfaces and for certain smooth threefolds. On the other hand, we prove that for derived categories of finite dimensional representations of finite acyclic quivers (which are allowed to be wild), for nontrivial admissible subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ and for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length. If this property would also hold for the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in $10$ general points, then Krah's phantom subcategory would have infinite length. In particular, it would have an infinite length chain of thick subcategories.</description>

      <title>Affine $\imath$quantum groups and twisted Yangians in Drinfeld presentations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of split type) in current generators and relations, via a degeneration of the Drinfeld presentation of affine $\imath$quantum groups (associated with split Satake diagrams). These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras; presentations for twisted current algebras are also provided. For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition. We conjecture that our split twisted Yangians are isomorphic to the corresponding ones in RTT presentation.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties and Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embeddings and exhibit an embedding of the former into the latter. Both rings are cluster algebras and the embedding respects the cluster algebra structures in the sense that there exists a seed for the Grassmannian that restricts to a seed for the partial flag variety (\textit{i.e.} it is obtained by freezing and deleting some cluster variables).
  The motivation for this project stems from the application of cluster algebras in scattering amplitudes: spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties describe massless scattering without assuming dual conformal symmetry. Both may be obtained from Grassmanninas which model the dual conformal case. They are instances of partial flag varieties and their cluster structures reveal information for the scattering amplitudes. As an application of our main result we exhibit the relation between these cluster algebras.</description>
