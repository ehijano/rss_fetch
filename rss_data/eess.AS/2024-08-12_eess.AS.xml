      <title>ADD 2023: Towards Audio Deepfake Detection and Analysis in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prominence of the field of audio deepfake detection is driven by its wide range of applications, notably in protecting the public from potential fraud and other malicious activities, prompting the need for greater attention and research in this area. The ADD 2023 challenge goes beyond binary real/fake classification by emulating real-world scenarios, such as the identification of manipulated intervals in partially fake audio and determining the source responsible for generating any fake audio, both with real-life implications, notably in audio forensics, law enforcement, and construction of reliable and trustworthy evidence. To further foster research in this area, in this article, we describe the dataset that was used in the fake game, manipulation region location and deepfake algorithm recognition tracks of the challenge. We also focus on the analysis of the technical methodologies by the top-performing participants in each task and note the commonalities and differences in their approaches. Finally, we discuss the current technical limitations as identified through the technical analysis, and provide a roadmap for future research directions. The dataset is available for download.</description>

      <title>Abstractive summarization from Audio Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, large language models are gaining popularity, their achievements are used in many areas, ranging from text translation to generating answers to queries. However, the main problem with these new machine learning algorithms is that training such models requires large computing resources that only large IT companies have. To avoid this problem, a number of methods (LoRA, quantization) have been proposed so that existing models can be effectively fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose an E2E (end to end) audio summarization model using these techniques. In addition, this paper examines the effectiveness of these approaches to the problem under consideration and draws conclusions about the applicability of these methods.</description>

      <title>MulliVC: Multi-lingual Voice Conversion With Cycle Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice conversion aims to modify the source speaker's voice to resemble the target speaker while preserving the original speech content. Despite notable advancements in voice conversion these days, multi-lingual voice conversion (including both monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios) has yet to be extensively studied. It faces two main challenges: 1) the considerable variability in prosody and articulation habits across languages; and 2) the rarity of paired multi-lingual datasets from the same speaker. In this paper, we propose MulliVC, a novel voice conversion system that only converts timbre and keeps original content and source language prosody without multi-lingual paired data. Specifically, each training step of MulliVC contains three substeps: In step one the model is trained with monolingual speech data; then, steps two and three take inspiration from back translation, construct a cyclical process to disentangle the timbre and other information (content, prosody, and other language-related information) in the absence of multi-lingual data from the same speaker. Both objective and subjective results indicate that MulliVC significantly surpasses other methods in both monolingual and cross-lingual contexts, demonstrating the system's efficacy and the viability of the three-step approach with cycle consistency. Audio samples can be found on our demo page (mullivc.github.io).</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Corpus Bias Problem in Automatic Music Transcription Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is the task of recognizing notes in audio recordings of music. The State-of-the-Art (SotA) benchmarks have been dominated by deep learning systems. Due to the scarcity of high quality data, they are usually trained and evaluated exclusively or predominantly on classical piano music. Unfortunately, that hinders our ability to understand how they generalize to other music. Previous works have revealed several aspects of memorization and overfitting in these systems. We identify two primary sources of distribution shift: the music, and the sound. Complementing recent results on the sound axis (i.e. acoustics, timbre), we investigate the musical one (i.e. note combinations, dynamics, genre). We evaluate the performance of several SotA AMT systems on two new experimental test sets which we carefully construct to emulate different levels of musical distribution shift. Our results reveal a stark performance gap, shedding further light on the Corpus Bias problem, and the extent to which it continues to trouble these systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Consistency-Preserving Loss and Perceptual Contrast Stretching to Boost SSL-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSL) has attained SOTA results on several downstream speech tasks, but SSL-based speech enhancement (SE) solutions still lag behind. To address this issue, we exploit three main ideas: (i) Transformer-based masking generation, (ii) consistency-preserving loss, and (iii) perceptual contrast stretching (PCS). In detail, conformer layers, leveraging an attention mechanism, are introduced to effectively model frame-level representations and obtain the Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM) for SE. Moreover, we incorporate consistency in the loss function, which processes the input to account for the inconsistency effects of signal reconstruction from the spectrogram. Finally, PCS is employed to improve the contrast of input and target features according to perceptual importance. Evaluated on the VoiceBank-DEMAND task, the proposed solution outperforms previously SSL-based SE solutions when tested on several objective metrics, attaining a SOTA PESQ score of 3.54.</description>

      <title>Hyper Recurrent Neural Network: Condition Mechanisms for Black-box Audio Effect Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have demonstrated impressive results for virtual analog modeling of audio effects. These networks process time-domain audio signals using a series of matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation functions to emulate the behavior of the target device accurately. To additionally model the effect of the knobs for an RNN-based model, existing approaches integrate control parameters by concatenating them channel-wisely with some intermediate representation of the input signal. While this method is parameter-efficient, there is room to further improve the quality of generated audio because the concatenation-based conditioning method has limited capacity in modulating signals. In this paper, we propose three novel conditioning mechanisms for RNNs, tailored for black-box virtual analog modeling. These advanced conditioning mechanisms modulate the model based on control parameters, yielding superior results to existing RNN- and CNN-based architectures across various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>TEAdapter: Supply abundant guidance for controllable text-to-music generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although current text-guided music generation technology can cope with simple creative scenarios, achieving fine-grained control over individual text-modality conditions remains challenging as user demands become more intricate. Accordingly, we introduce the TEAcher Adapter (TEAdapter), a compact plugin designed to guide the generation process with diverse control information provided by users. In addition, we explore the controllable generation of extended music by leveraging TEAdapter control groups trained on data of distinct structural functionalities. In general, we consider controls over global, elemental, and structural levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TEAdapter enables multiple precise controls and ensures high-quality music generation. Our module is also lightweight and transferable to any diffusion model architecture. Available code and demos will be found soon at https://github.com/Ashley1101/TEAdapter.</description>

      <title>AcousAF: Acoustic Sensing-Based Atrial Fibrillation Detection System for Mobile Phones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by irregular electrical impulses originating in the atria, which can lead to severe complications and even death. Due to the intermittent nature of the AF, early and timely monitoring of AF is critical for patients to prevent further exacerbation of the condition. Although ambulatory ECG Holter monitors provide accurate monitoring, the high cost of these devices hinders their wider adoption. Current mobile-based AF detection systems offer a portable solution. However, these systems have various applicability issues, such as being easily affected by environmental factors and requiring significant user effort. To overcome the above limitations, we present AcousAF, a novel AF detection system based on acoustic sensors of smartphones. Particularly, we explore the potential of pulse wave acquisition from the wrist using smartphone speakers and microphones. In addition, we propose a well-designed framework comprised of pulse wave probing, pulse wave extraction, and AF detection to ensure accurate and reliable AF detection. We collect data from 20 participants utilizing our custom data collection application on the smartphone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the high performance of our system, with 92.8% accuracy, 86.9% precision, 87.4% recall, and 87.1% F1 Score.</description>

      <title>SELD-Mamba: Selective State-Space Model for Sound Event Localization and Detection with Source Distance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) task, Transformer-based models have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, the quadratic complexity of the Transformer's self-attention mechanism results in computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a network architecture for SELD called SELD-Mamba, which utilizes Mamba, a selective state-space model. We adopt the Event-Independent Network V2 (EINV2) as the foundational framework and replace its Conformer blocks with bidirectional Mamba blocks to capture a broader range of contextual information while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we implement a two-stage training method, with the first stage focusing on Sound Event Detection (SED) and Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation losses, and the second stage reintroducing the Source Distance Estimation (SDE) loss. Our experimental results on the 2024 DCASE Challenge Task3 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the selective state-space model in SELD and highlight the benefits of the two-stage training approach in enhancing SELD performance.</description>

      <title>DurFlex-EVC: Duration-Flexible Emotional Voice Conversion with Parallel Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotional voice conversion involves modifying the pitch, spectral envelope, and other acoustic characteristics of speech to match a desired emotional state while maintaining the speaker's identity. Recent advances in EVC involve simultaneously modeling pitch and duration by exploiting the potential of sequence-to-sequence models. In this study, we focus on parallel speech generation to increase the reliability and efficiency of conversion. We introduce a duration-flexible EVC (DurFlex-EVC) that integrates a style autoencoder and a unit aligner. The previous variable-duration parallel generation model required text-to-speech alignment. We consider self-supervised model representation and discrete speech units to be the core of our parallel generation. The style autoencoder promotes content style disentanglement by separating the source style of the input features and applying them with the target style. The unit aligner encodes unit-level features by modeling emotional context. Furthermore, we enhance the style of the features with a hierarchical stylize encoder and generate high-quality Mel-spectrograms with a diffusion-based generator. The effectiveness of the approach has been validated through subjective and objective evaluations and has been demonstrated to be superior to baseline models.</description>
