      <title>Minimax Optimal Goodness-of-Fit Testing with Kernel Stein Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the minimax optimality of goodness-of-fit tests on general domains using the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). The KSD framework offers a flexible approach for goodness-of-fit testing, avoiding strong distributional assumptions, accommodating diverse data structures beyond Euclidean spaces, and relying only on partial knowledge of the reference distribution, while maintaining computational efficiency. We establish a general framework and an operator-theoretic representation of the KSD, encompassing many existing KSD tests in the literature, which vary depending on the domain. We reveal the characteristics and limitations of KSD and demonstrate its non-optimality under a certain alternative space, defined over general domains when considering $\chi^2$-divergence as the separation metric. To address this issue of non-optimality, we propose a modified, minimax optimal test by incorporating a spectral regularizer, thereby overcoming the shortcomings of standard KSD tests. Our results are established under a weak moment condition on the Stein kernel, which relaxes the bounded kernel assumption required by prior work in the analysis of kernel-based hypothesis testing. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive test capable of achieving minimax optimality up to a logarithmic factor by adapting to unknown parameters. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the superior performance of our proposed tests across various domains compared to their unregularized counterparts.</description>

      <title>On testing mean of high dimensional compositional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate one/two-sample mean tests for high-dimensional compositional data when the number of variables is comparable with the sample size, as commonly encountered in microbiome research. Existing methods mainly focus on max-type test statistics which are suitable for detecting sparse signals. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach using sum-type test statistics which are capable of detecting weak but dense signals. By establishing the asymptotic independence between the max-type and sum-type test statistics, we further propose a combined max-sum type test to cover both cases. We derived the asymptotic null distributions and power functions for these test statistics. Simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of our max-sum type test statistics which exhibit robust performance regardless of data sparsity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Universal Quantum Encoding for Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal encoding of classical data for statistical inference using quantum computing is investigated. A universal encoder is sought that is optimal for a wide array of statistical inference tasks. Accuracy of any statistical inference is shown to be upper bounded by a term that is proportional to maximal quantum leakage from the classical data, i.e., the input to the inference model, through its quantum encoding. This demonstrates that the maximal quantum leakage is a universal measure of the quality of the encoding strategy for statistical inference as it only depends on the quantum encoding of the data and not the inference task itself. The optimal universal encoding strategy, i.e., the encoding strategy that maximizes the maximal quantum leakage, is proved to be attained by pure states. When there are enough qubits, basis encoding is proved to be universally optimal. An iterative method for numerically computing the optimal universal encoding strategy is presented.</description>

      <title>Sliding down the stairs: how correlated latent variables accelerate learning with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Partial Conditioning for Inference of Many-Normal-Means with H\"older Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferential models have been proposed for valid and efficient prior-free probabilistic inference. As it gradually gained popularity, this theory is subject to further developments for practically challenging problems. This paper considers the many-normal-means problem with the means constrained to be in the neighborhood of each other, formally represented by a H\"older space. A new method, called partial conditioning, is proposed to generate valid and efficient marginal inference about the individual means. It is shown that the method outperforms both a fiducial-counterpart in terms of validity and a conservative-counterpart in terms of efficiency. We conclude the paper by remarking that a general theory of partial conditioning for inferential models deserves future development.</description>

      <title>Root-n consistent semiparametric learning with high-dimensional nuisance functions under minimal sparsity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment effect estimation under unconfoundedness is a fundamental task in causal inference. In response to the challenge of analyzing high-dimensional datasets collected in substantive fields such as epidemiology, genetics, economics, and social sciences, many methods for treatment effect estimation with high-dimensional nuisance parameters (the outcome regression and the propensity score) have been developed in recent years. However, it is still unclear what is the necessary and sufficient sparsity condition on the nuisance parameters for the treatment effect to be $\sqrt{n}$-estimable. In this paper, we propose a new Double-Calibration strategy that corrects the estimation bias of the nuisance parameter estimates computed by regularized high-dimensional techniques and demonstrate that the corresponding Doubly-Calibrated estimator achieves $1 / \sqrt{n}$-rate as long as one of the nuisance parameters is sparse with sparsity below $\sqrt{n} / \log p$, where $p$ denotes the ambient dimension of the covariates, whereas the other nuisance parameter can be arbitrarily complex and completely misspecified. The Double-Calibration strategy can also be applied to settings other than treatment effect estimation, e.g. regression coefficient estimation in the presence of diverging number of controls in a semiparametric partially linear model.</description>

      <title>A Bernstein-von Mises Theorem for Generalized Fiducial Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Bernstein-von Mises result for generalized fiducial distributions following the approach based on quadratic mean differentiability in Le Cam (1986); van der Vaart (1998). Building on their approach, we introduce only two additional conditions for the generalized fiducial setting. While asymptotic normality of generalized fiducial distributions has been studied before, particularly in Hannig (2009) and Sonderegger and Hannig (2014), this work significantly extends the usefulness of such a result by the much more general condition of quadratic mean differentiability. We demonstrate the applicability of our result with two examples that necessitate these more general assumptions: the triangular distributions and free-knot spline models.</description>

      <title>The German Tank Problem with Multiple Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the Second World War, estimates of the number of tanks deployed by Germany were critically needed. The Allies adopted two methods to estimate this information: espionage and statistical analysis. The latter approach was far more successful and is as follows: assuming that the tanks are sequentially numbered starting from 1, if we observe $k$ serial numbers from an unknown total of $N$ tanks, with the highest observed number being $M$, then the best linear unbiased estimator for $N$ is $M(1+1/k)-1$. This is now known as the German Tank Problem. Suppose one wishes to estimate the productivity of a rival by inspecting captured or destroyed tanks, each with a unique serial number. In many situations, the original German Tank Problem is insufficient, since typically there are $l&gt;1$ factories, and tanks produced by different factories may have serial numbers in disjoint ranges that are often far separated, let alone sequentially numbered starting from 1. We wish to estimate the total tank production across all of the factories. We construct an efficient procedure to estimate the total productivity and prove that our procedure effectively estimates $N$ when $\log l/\log k$ is sufficiently small, and is robust against both large and small gaps between factories. In the final section, we show that given information about the gaps, we can make a far better estimator that is also effective when we have a small number of samples. When the number of samples is small compared to the number of gaps, the Mean Squared Error of this new estimator is several orders of magnitude smaller than the one that assumes no information. This quantifies the importance of hiding such information if one wishes to conceal their productivity from a rival.</description>

      <title>A two-way heterogeneity model for dynamic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic network data analysis requires joint modelling individual snapshots and time dynamics. This paper proposes a new two-way heterogeneity model towards this goal. The new model equips each node of the network with two heterogeneity parameters, one to characterize the propensity of forming ties with other nodes and the other to differentiate the tendency of retaining existing ties over time. Though the negative log-likelihood function is non-convex, it is locally convex in a neighbourhood of the true value of the parameter vector. By using a novel method of moments estimator as the initial value, the consistent local maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) can be obtained by a gradient descent algorithm. To establish the upper bound for the estimation error of the MLE, we derive a new uniform deviation bound, which is of independent interest. The usefulness of the model and the associated theory are further supported by extensive simulation and the analysis of some real network data sets.</description>

      <title>The Curious Price of Distributional Robustness in Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates model robustness in reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce the sim-to-real gap in practice. We adopt the framework of distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), aimed at learning a policy that optimizes the worst-case performance when the deployed environment falls within a prescribed uncertainty set around the nominal MDP. Despite recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs remained mostly unsettled regardless of the uncertainty set in use. It was unclear if distributional robustness bears any statistical consequences when benchmarked against standard RL. Assuming access to a generative model that draws samples based on the nominal MDP, we characterize the sample complexity of RMDPs when the uncertainty set is specified via either the total variation (TV) distance or $\chi^2$ divergence. The algorithm studied here is a model-based method called {\em distributionally robust value iteration}, which is shown to be near-optimal for the full range of uncertainty levels. Somewhat surprisingly, our results uncover that RMDPs are not necessarily easier or harder to learn than standard MDPs. The statistical consequence incurred by the robustness requirement depends heavily on the size and shape of the uncertainty set: in the case w.r.t.~the TV distance, the minimax sample complexity of RMDPs is always smaller than that of standard MDPs; in the case w.r.t.~the $\chi^2$ divergence, the sample complexity of RMDPs can often far exceed the standard MDP counterpart.</description>

      <title>Inference for Synthetic Controls via Refined Placebo Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synthetic control method is often applied to problems with one treated unit and a small number of control units. A common inferential task in this setting is to test null hypotheses regarding the average treatment effect on the treated. Inference procedures that are justified asymptotically are often unsatisfactory due to (1) small sample sizes that render large-sample approximation fragile and (2) simplification of the estimation procedure that is implemented in practice. An alternative is permutation inference, which is related to a common diagnostic called the placebo test. It has provable Type-I error guarantees in finite samples without simplification of the method, when the treatment is uniformly assigned. Despite this robustness, the placebo test suffers from low resolution since the null distribution is constructed from only $N$ reference estimates, where $N$ is the sample size. This creates a barrier for statistical inference at a common level like $\alpha = 0.05$, especially when $N$ is small. We propose a novel leave-two-out procedure that bypasses this issue, while still maintaining the same finite-sample Type-I error guarantee under uniform assignment for a wide range of $N$. Unlike the placebo test whose Type-I error always equals the theoretical upper bound, our procedure often achieves a lower unconditional Type-I error than theory suggests; this enables useful inference in the challenging regime when $\alpha &lt; 1/N$. Empirically, our procedure achieves a higher power when the effect size is reasonably large and a comparable power otherwise. We generalize our procedure to non-uniform assignments and show how to conduct sensitivity analysis. From a methodological perspective, our procedure can be viewed as a new type of randomization inference different from permutation or rank-based inference, which is particularly effective in small samples.</description>
