      <title>Cohesive Subgraph Discovery in Hypergraphs: A Locality-Driven Indexing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are increasingly employed to model complex, diverse relationships in modern networks, effectively capturing higher-order interactions. A critical challenge in this domain is the discovery of cohesive subgraphs, which provides valuable insights into hypergraph structures. However, selecting suitable parameters for this task remains unresolved. To address this, we propose an efficient indexing framework designed for online retrieval of cohesive subgraphs. Our approach enables rapid identification of desired structures without requiring exhaustive graph traversals, thus ensuring scalability and practicality. This framework has broad applicability, supporting informed decision-making across various domains by offering a comprehensive view of network landscapes. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed indexing technique.</description>

      <title>Free Energy and Network Structure: Breaking Scale-Free Behaviour Through Information Processing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show how The Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing. We propose a minimal FEP model for node behaviour reveals three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment. In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale. Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent's information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining them as signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints. We show that agents evolving under FEP principles provides a mechanism for preferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Truth Learning in a Social Network is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential learning models situations where agents predict a ground truth in sequence, by using their private, noisy measurements, and the predictions of agents who came earlier in the sequence. We study sequential learning in a social network, where agents only see the actions of the previous agents in their own neighborhood. The fraction of agents who predict the ground truth correctly depends heavily on both the network topology and the ordering in which the predictions are made. A natural question is to find an ordering, with a given network, to maximize the (expected) number of agents who predict the ground truth correctly. In this paper, we show that it is in fact NP-hard to answer this question for a general network, with both the Bayesian learning model and a simple majority rule model. Finally, we show that even approximating the answer is hard.</description>

      <title>Evaluating link prediction: New perspectives and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is an important problem in network science and machine learning research. The state-of-the-art LP methods are usually evaluated in a uniform setup, ignoring several factors associated with the data and application specific needs. We identify a number of such factors, such as, network-type, problem-type, geodesic distance between the end nodes and its distribution over the classes, nature and applicability of LP methods, class imbalance and its impact on early retrieval, evaluation metric, etc., and present an experimental setup which allows us to evaluate LP methods in a rigorous and controlled manner. We perform extensive experiments with a variety of LP methods over real network datasets in this controlled setup, and gather valuable insights on the interactions of these factors with the performance of LP through an array of carefully designed hypotheses. Following the insights, we provide recommendations to be followed as best practice for evaluating LP methods.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Interaction of Cultural Evolution Mechanisms in Experimental Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cognitive and social mechanisms shape the evolution of complex artifacts such as songs is central to cultural evolution research. Social network topology (what artifacts are available?), selection (which are chosen?), and reproduction (how are they copied?) have all been proposed as key influencing factors. However, prior research has rarely studied them together due to methodological challenges. We address this gap through a controlled naturalistic paradigm whereby participants (N=2,404) are placed in networks and are asked to iteratively choose and sing back melodies from their neighbors. We show that this setting yields melodies that are more complex and more pleasant than those found in the more-studied linear transmission setting, and exhibits robust differences across topologies. Crucially, these differences are diminished when selection or reproduction bias are eliminated, suggesting an interaction between mechanisms. These findings shed light on the interplay of mechanisms underlying the evolution of cultural artifacts.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Social Network Interventions via Hypergradient-Based Recommender System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although social networks have expanded the range of ideas and information accessible to users, they are also criticized for amplifying the polarization of user opinions. Given the inherent complexity of these phenomena, existing approaches to counteract these effects typically rely on handcrafted algorithms and heuristics. We propose an elegant solution: we act on the network weights that model user interactions on social networks (e.g., frequency of communication), to optimize a performance metric (e.g., polarization reduction), while users' opinions follow the classical Friedkin-Johnsen model. Our formulation gives rise to a challenging large-scale optimization problem with non-convex constraints, for which we develop a gradient-based algorithm. Our scheme is simple, scalable, and versatile, as it can readily integrate different, potentially non-convex, objectives. We demonstrate its merit by: (i) rapidly solving complex social network intervention problems with 3 million variables based on the Reddit and DBLP datasets; (ii) significantly outperforming competing approaches in terms of both computation time and disagreement reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Square matrices often arise in microeconomics, particularly in network models addressing applications from opinion dynamics to platform regulation. Spectral theory provides powerful tools for analyzing their properties. We present an accessible overview of several fundamental applications of spectral methods in microeconomics, focusing especially on the Perron-Frobenius Theorem's role and its connection to centrality measures. Applications include social learning, network games, public goods provision, and market intervention under uncertainty. The exposition assumes minimal social science background, using spectral theory as a unifying mathematical thread to introduce interested readers to some exciting current topics in microeconomic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Social Network Analysis (SNA), k-core decomposition is used to detect hierarchical shells in networks. The application of the K-core decomposition to a network of keywords allows us to represent the conceptual structure of a research field. The objective of this work was to propose the application of k-core decomposition to show the evolution of the conceptual structure of the Altmetrics research field. The methodology was developed in several phases: data collection, keyword selection, elaboration of a keyword co-occurrence matrix, generation of a keyword network, k-core decomposition and visualization of the hierarchical structure. The result was the detection of five differentiated shells. A core shell with basic, densely interconnected concepts that formed the knowledge base of the field. An intermediate shell with mediating concepts that showed the evolution of knowledge in the field. A lateral shell with concepts that indicated the specialization of the research field. A border shell with peripheral and isolated concepts, which represented the conceptual fronts in development. In conclusion, the hierarchical decomposition of the keyword network achieved a deeper understanding of the conceptual structure of the research field</description>

      <title>Role extraction by matrix equations and generalized random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nodes in a network can be grouped into 'roles' based on similar connection patterns. This is usually achieved by defining a pairwise node similarity matrix and then clustering rows and columns of this matrix. This paper presents a new similarity matrix for solving role extraction problems in directed networks, which is defined as the solution of a matrix equation and computes node similarities based on random walks that can proceed along the link direction and in the opposite direction. The resulting node similarity measure performs remarkably in role extraction tasks on directed networks with heterogeneous node degree distributions.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Hypergraph Mining: Patterns, Tools, and Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs, which belong to the family of higher-order networks, are a natural and powerful choice for modeling group interactions in the real world. For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for each and offer in-depth discussions for future research on hypergraph mining.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic Distance of Graphs and its Higher-Order Variants: Theoretical Properties with Applications to Centrality and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective resistance is a distance between vertices of a graph that is both theoretically interesting and useful in applications. We study a variant of effective resistance called the biharmonic distance. While the effective resistance measures how well-connected two vertices are, we prove several theoretical results supporting the idea that the biharmonic distance measures how important an edge is to the global topology of the graph. Our theoretical results connect the biharmonic distance to well-known measures of connectivity of a graph like its total resistance and sparsity. Based on these results, we introduce two clustering algorithms using the biharmonic distance. Finally, we introduce a further generalization of the biharmonic distance that we call the $k$-harmonic distance. We empirically study the utility of biharmonic and $k$-harmonic distance for edge centrality and graph clustering.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to explore the reasons behind dissent regarding their existence, antecedents, and effects. It provides a taxonomy of conceptualizations and operationalizations, analyzing how measurement approaches and contextual factors influence outcomes.
  The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North.
  Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EUs Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.</description>

      <title>HyGEN: Regularizing Negative Hyperedge Generation for Accurate Hyperedge Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperedge prediction is a fundamental task to predict future high-order relations based on the observed network structure. Existing hyperedge prediction methods, however, suffer from the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem, negative sampling methods can be used, which leverage non-existing hyperedges as contrastive information for model training. However, the following important challenges have been rarely studied: (C1) lack of guidance for generating negatives and (C2) possibility of producing false negatives. To address them, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction method, HyGEN, that employs (1) a negative hyperedge generator that employs positive hyperedges as a guidance to generate more realistic ones and (2) a regularization term that prevents the generated hyperedges from being false negatives. Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that HyGEN consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art hyperedge prediction methods.</description>

      <title>LGDE: Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on two user-generated English-language corpora and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with improved performance relative to methods based on direct word similarities or co-occurrences. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.</description>

      <title>Analyzing News Engagement on Facebook: Tracking Ideological Segregation and News Quality in the Facebook URL Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Dataset was released to enable independent, academic research on the impact of Facebook's platform on society while ensuring user privacy. The dataset has been used in several studies to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and societal issues such as misinformation, polarization, and the quality of consumed news. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the engagement with popular news domains, covering four years from January 2017 to December 2020, with a focus on user engagement metrics related to news URLs in the U.S. By incorporating the ideological alignment and quality of news sources, along with users' political preferences, we construct weighted averages of ideology and quality of news consumption for liberal, conservative, and moderate audiences. This allows us to track the evolution of (i) the ideological gap in news consumption between liberals and conservatives and (ii) the average quality of each group's news consumption. We identify two major shifts in trends, each tied to engagement changes. In both, the ideological gap widens and news quality declines. However, engagement rises in the first shift but falls in the second. Finally, we contextualize these trends by linking them to two major Facebook News Feed updates. Our findings provide empirical evidence to better understand user behavior, polarization, and misinformation during the period covered by the dataset.</description>

      <title>What Do LLMs Need to Understand Graphs: A Survey of Parametric Representation of Graphs</title>

Abstract: Graphs, as a relational data structure, have been widely used for various application scenarios, like molecule design and recommender systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) are reorganizing in the AI community for their expected reasoning and inference abilities. Making LLMs understand graph-based relational data has great potential, including but not limited to (1) distillate external knowledge base for eliminating hallucination and breaking the context window limit for LLMs' inference during the retrieval augmentation generation process; (2) taking graph data as the input and directly solve the graph-based research tasks like protein design and drug discovery. However, inputting the entire graph data to LLMs is not practical due to its complex topological structure, data size, and the lack of effective and efficient semantic graph representations. A natural question arises: Is there a kind of graph representation that can be described by natural language for LLM's understanding and is also easy to require to serve as the raw input for LLMs? Based on statistical computation, graph laws pre-define a set of parameters (e.g., degree, time, diameter) and identifie their relationships and values by observing the topological distribution of plenty of real-world graph data. We believe this kind of parametric representation of graphs, graph laws, can be a solution for making LLMs understand graph data as the input. In this survey, we first review the previous study of graph laws from multiple perspectives, i.e., macroscope and microscope of graphs, low-order and high-order graphs, static and dynamic graphs, different observation spaces, and newly proposed graph parameters. After we review various real-world applications benefiting from the guidance of graph laws, we conclude the paper with current challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Network-informed Prompt Engineering against Organized Astroturf Campaigns under Extreme Class Imbalance</title>

Abstract: Detecting organized political campaigns is of paramount importance in fighting against disinformation on social media. Existing approaches for the identification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network science, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Their ultimate goal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among users and the textual similarities of their posts. Despite their effectiveness in recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges, notably the class imbalance in available training datasets. To mitigate this issue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the number of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in real-world settings. Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large language models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Balanced RAG) component. Our approach first gives both textual information concerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the social network as input to a language model. Then, through prompt engineering and the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated disinformation campaigns on X (Twitter). The proposed framework does not require any training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, by strategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG, it facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively identify coordinated political campaigns. The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed prompt engineering and Balanced RAG methods, our framework outperforms the traditional graph-based baselines, achieving 2x-3x improvements in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores.</description>

      <title>Prosocial Media</title>

Abstract: Social media empower distributed content creation by algorithmically harnessing "the social fabric" (explicit and implicit signals of association) to serve this content. While this overcomes the bottlenecks and biases of traditional gatekeepers, many believe it has unsustainably eroded the very social fabric it depends on by maximizing engagement for advertising revenue. This paper participates in open and ongoing considerations to translate social and political values and conventions, specifically social cohesion, into platform design. We propose an alternative platform model that the social fabric an explicit output as well as input. Citizens are members of communities defined by explicit affiliation or clusters of shared attitudes. Both have internal divisions, as citizens are members of intersecting communities, which are themselves internally diverse. Each is understood to value content that bridge (viz. achieve consensus across) and balance (viz. represent fairly) this internal diversity, consistent with the principles of the Hutchins Commission (1947). Content is labeled with social provenance, indicating for which community or citizen it is bridging or balancing. Subscription payments allow citizens and communities to increase the algorithmic weight on the content they value in the content serving algorithm. Advertisers may, with consent of citizen or community counterparties, target them in exchange for payment or increase in that party's algorithmic weight. Underserved and emerging communities and citizens are optimally subsidized/supported to develop into paying participants. Content creators and communities that curate content are rewarded for their contributions with algorithmic weight and/or revenue. We discuss applications to productivity (e.g. LinkedIn), political (e.g. X), and cultural (e.g. TikTok) platforms.</description>
