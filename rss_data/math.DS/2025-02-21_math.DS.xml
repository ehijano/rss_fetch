      <title>Measure rigidity for generalized u-Gibbs states and stationary measures via the factorization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain measure rigidity results for stationary measures of random walks generated by diffeomorphisms, and for actions of $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ on smooth manifolds. Our main technical result, from which the rest of the theorems are derived, applies also to the case of a single diffeomorphism or $1$-parameter flow and establishes extra invariance of a class of measures that we call ``generalized u-Gibbs states''.</description>

      <title>On the Lyapunov spectrum of the twisted cocycle for substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the properties of a complex matrix ``twisted,'' otherwise called ``spectral,'' cocycle, associated with substitution dynamical systems. Following a recent finding of Rajabzadeh and Safaee [arXiv:2501.16824] of an invariant section for the twisted cocycle, we indicate that this implies presence of a zero Lyapunov exponent. This has consequences for the spectral properties of substitution dynamical systems; in particular, this extends the scope and simplifies the proof of singular spectrum for a large class of substitutions on two symbols. We also obtain some results on positivity of the top exponent. In the appendix we compute the Lebesgue almost everywhere local dimension of spectral measures of some ``simple'' test functions, for almost every irrational rotation. This sheds some light on the earlier work of Bufetov and the author, relating the local dimension of spectral measures to pointwise Lyapunov exponents of the twisted cocycle. It should be noted that the paper has some (mutually acknowledged) overlap with [arXiv:2501.16824, Appendix].</description>

      <title>Thermal phototactic bioconvection in an isotropic porous medium heated from above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates thermal phototactic bioconvection in an isotropic porous medium using the Darcy-Brinkman model. The top boundary of the medium is exposed to normal collimated light and subjected to heating. A linear analysis of bio-thermal convection is performed using a fourth-order accurate finite difference scheme, employing Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich iterations for both rigid-free and rigid-rigid boundary conditions. The effects of the Lewis number, Darcy number, and thermal Rayleigh number on bioconvective processes are examined and presented graphically. The findings reveal that increasing the thermal Rayleigh number stabilizes the suspension, whereas a higher Lewis number enhances instability.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven Synchronization of Vicsek Model in Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek model has long stood as a pivotal framework in exploring collective behavior and self-organization, captivating the scientific community with its compelling dynamics. However, understanding how noise influences synchronization within this model and its associated phase transition characteristics has presented significant challenges. While numerous studies have focused on simulations due to the model's mathematical complexity, comprehensive theoretical analyses remain sparse. In this paper, we deliver a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that for any initial configuration of the Vicsek model, there exists a bound on noise amplitude such that if the noise amplitude is maintained within this bound, the system will achieve synchronization in mean. This finding not only lays a solid mathematical groundwork for the Vicsek model's phase transition theory but also underscores the critical role of noise in collective dynamics, enhancing our understanding of self-organizing systems in stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home When Doubled and Scaled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions of SO(n).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\psi : \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ be a non-increasing function. Denote by $W(\psi)$ the set of $\psi$-well-approximable points and by $E(\psi)$ the set of points such that for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$ there exist infinitely many $(p,q)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N} $ with $$\left(1-\epsilon\right)\psi(q)&lt; \left| x-p/q\right|&lt; \psi(q) .$$ In this paper, we investigate the metric properties of set $E(\psi).$ Specifically, we compute the Hausdorff $\mathcal{H}^s$-measure of $E(\psi)$ for a large class numbers of $s \in (0,1).$ Additionally, we establish that $$\dim_{\mathcal H} E(\psi_1) \times \cdots \times E(\psi_n) =\min \{ \dim_{\mathcal H} E(\psi_i)+n-1: 1\le i \le n \},$$ where $\psi_i:\mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0} $ is a non-increasing function satisfying $\psi_i(x)=o(x^{-2}) $ for all $1\le i \le n.$</description>

      <title>On the cyclicity of hyperbolic polycycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a planar smooth vector field with a polycycle $\Gamma^n$ with $n$ sides and all its corners, that are at most $n$ singularities, being hyperbolic saddles. In this paper we study the cyclicity of $\Gamma^n$ in terms of the hyperbolicity ratios of these saddles, giving explicit conditions that ensure that it is at least $k,$ for any $k\leqslant n.$ Our result extends old results and also provides a more accurate proof of the known ones because we rely on some recent powerful works that study in more detail the regularity with respect to initial conditions and parameters of the Dulac map of hyperbolic saddles for families of vector fields. We also prove that when $X$ is polynomial there is a polynomial perturbation (in general with degree much higher that the one of $X$) that attains each of the obtained lower bounds for the cyclicities. Finally, we also study some related inverse problems and provide concrete examples of applications in the polynomial world.</description>

      <title>On the Hofer-Zehnder conjecture for non-contractible periodic orbits in Hamiltonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat an open problem related to the number of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed symplectic manifolds. Hofer-Zehnder conjecture states that a Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms has infinitely many periodic orbits if it has "homologically unnecessary periodic orbits"". For example, non-contractible periodic orbits are homologically unnecessary periodic orbits because Floer homology of non-contractible periodic orbits is trivial. We prove Hofer-Zehnder conjecture for non-contractible periodic orbits for very wide classes of symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Liouville property for groups and conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal dimension is a fundamental invariant of metric spaces, particularly suited to the study of self-similar spaces, such as spaces with an expanding self-covering (e.g. Julia sets of complex rational functions). The dynamics of these systems are encoded by the associated iterated monodromy groups, which are examples of contracting self-similar groups. Their amenability is a well-known open question. We show that if $G$ is an iterated monodromy group, and if the (Alfhors-regular) conformal dimension of the underlying space is strictly less than 2, then every symmetric random walk with finite second moment on $G$ has the Liouville property. As a corollary, every such group is amenable. This criterion applies to all examples of contracting groups previously known to be amenable, and to many new ones. In particular, it implies that for every sub-hyperbolic complex rational function $f$ whose Julia set is not the whole sphere, the iterated monodromy group of $f$ is amenable.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Compartmental and Cooperative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present article considers stability of the solutions to nonlinear and nonautonomous compartmental systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In particular, compartmental systems with a right-hand side that can be written as a product of a matrix function and vector function. Sufficient, and on occasion necessary, conditions on the matrix function are provided to conclude exponential stability of the null solution. The conditions involve verifying that the matrix function takes its values in a set of compartmental matrices on a certain canonical form, and are easy to check. Similar conditions are provided to establish incremental exponential stability for compartmental systems governed by cooperative systems of ODEs. The solutions to such systems satisfy a so-called ordering. Systems that are cooperative in a box, are shown to be incrementally asymptotically stable if and only if every pair of initially ordered solutions converge to each other. Traffic Reaction Models are used to illustrate the results, which are numerical schemes to solve conservation laws in one spatial dimension. Suitable conditions on the flux function of the conservation law are given such that the numerical scheme gives rise to an incrementally exponentially stable system.</description>

      <title>When invariance implies exchangeability (and applications to invariant Keisler measures)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of when, given a countable homogeneous structure $M$ and a space $S$ of expansions of $M$, every $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant probability measure on $S$ is exchangeable (i.e. invariant under all permutations of the domain). We show, for example, that if $M$ is a finitely bounded homogeneous $3$-hypergraph with free amalgamation (including the generic tetrahedron-free $3$-hypergraph), all $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant random expansions by graphs are exchangeable. Moreover, we extend and recover both the work of Angel, Kechris, and Lyons on invariant random orderings and some of the work of Crane and Towsner, and Ackerman on relative exchangeability.
  In the second part of the paper, we apply our results to the study of invariant Keisler measures, which we prove to be particular invariant random expansions. Thus, we describe the spaces of invariant Keisler measures of various homogeneous structures, obtaining the first results of this kind since the work of Albert and Ensley. We also show there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ supersimple homogeneous ternary structures for which there are non-forking formulas which are universally measure zero.</description>

      <title>An exact active sensing strategy for a class of bio-inspired systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general class of translation-invariant systems with a specific category of output nonlinearities motivated by biological sensing. We show that no dynamic output feedback can stabilize this class of systems to an isolated equilibrium point. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose a simple control scheme that includes a low-amplitude periodic forcing function akin to so-called "active sensing" in biology, together with nonlinear output feedback. Our analysis shows that this approach leads to the emergence of an exponentially stable limit cycle. These findings offer a provably stable active sensing strategy and may thus help to rationalize the active sensing movements made by animals as they perform certain motor behaviors.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics are systems of equations describing the evolution of macroscopic states in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. From generalized Onsager reciprocal relationships, one can formulate a class of hydrodynamics as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, Onsager gradient flows have been widely investigated in optimal transport-type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, namely hydrodynamical density manifolds. This paper studies geometric calculations in these hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate Levi-Civita connections, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport and then derive Riemannian and sectional curvatures on density manifolds. We last present closed formulas for sectional curvatures of density manifolds in one dimensional spaces, in which the sign of curvatures is characterized by the convexities of mobilities. For example, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures in zero-range models, such as independent particles, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti models.</description>

Abstract: Given an end-periodic homeomorphism $f: S \to S$ we give a lower bound on the Handel--Miller stretch factor of $f$ in terms of the core characteristic of $f$, which is a measure of topological complexity for an end-periodic homeomorphism. We also show that this bound is asymptotically sharp.</description>
