      <title>Gravitational waves and black holes from the phase transition in models of dynamical symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking predict a strong first order cosmological phase transition: we compute the resulting signals, primordial black holes and gravitational waves. These theories employ one SM-neutral scalar, plus some extra model-dependent particle to get the desired quantum potential out of classical scale invariance. We consider models where the extra particle is a scalar singlet, or vectors of an extended U(1) or SU(2) gauge sector. In models where the extra particle is stable, it provides a particle Dark Matter candidate with freeze-out abundance that tends to dominate over primordial black holes. These can instead be DM in models without a particle DM candidate. Gravitational waves arise at a level observable in future searches, even in regions where DM cannot be directly tested.</description>

      <title>The next frontiers for magnetic monopole searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles (MMs) are well-motivated hypothetical particles whose discovery would symmetrize Maxwell equations, explain quantization of electric charge, and probe the gauge structure of the unified theory. Recent models predict MMs with low masses, reinvigorating searches at colliders. However, most theories predict composite MMs, whose production in parton-parton collisions is expected to be suppressed. The Schwinger process, whereby MM pairs tunnel through the vacuum barrier in the presence of a strong magnetic field, is not subject to this limitation. Additionally, the Schwinger cross section can be calculated nonperturbatively. Together, these make it a golden channel for low-mass MM searches. We investigate the Schwinger production of MMs in heavy-ion collisions at future colliders, in collisions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, and in decay of magnetic fields of cosmic origin. We find that a next-generation collider would provide the best sensitivity. At the same time, exploiting the infrastructure of industrial ore extraction and Antarctic ice drilling could advance the field at a faster timescale and with only a modest investment. We also propose deploying dedicated MM detectors in conjunction with cosmic ray observatories to directly investigate if the unexplained, highest energy cosmic rays are MMs. Together, the proposed efforts would define the field of MM searches in the next decades.</description>

      <title>Modified electron trajectory due to axion dark matter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the coupling of the axion-like particle with the photon modifies Maxwell equations. One of the main consequences of these modifications is the conversion of axions into photons. Little has been said about the effect of the modified electromagnetic fields by the axion-like particles background on the trajectory of charged particles. In this note, we show that the trajectory of an electron can be significantly altered in this modified axion-electrodynamics. As a representative example, with current values of the dark matter density and the magnetic field strength on Earth, it is shown that an axion-like particle with a mass $\mu_a\sim 10^{-15}$eV will change the trajectory of an electron by several kilometers. Other scenarios are briefly mentioned.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions from COHERENT and PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the effective field theory framework, using data from the first measurement of solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) in the PandaX-4T experiment and the COHERENT experiment. In the PandaX-4T experiment, due to relatively large statistical uncertainties and measured CE$\nu$NS counts that significantly differ from the Standard Model predictions, its sensitivities to the neutrino NSIs are currently limited, compared to the COHERENT experiment. However, the PandaX-4T experiment is uniquely sensitive to the neutrino NSIs for the $\tau$ flavor due to oscillation feature of the solar $^8$B neutrinos. We also assess how the experimental central value, exposure, and systematic uncertainties will affect the constraints on neutrino NSIs from various CE$\nu$NS measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Semi-visible jets + X: Illuminating Dark Showers with Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential to search for semi-visible jets (SVJs) at the LHC using initial-state radiation (ISR). Both photon ISR and jet ISR channels are considered, using a benchmark signal model with the decay of a leptophobic $Z^\prime$ mediator forming two SVJs. We compare and extend several techniques to decompose the missing transverse momentum into per-jet contributions, in order to reconstruct the mediator mass and to define a new observable measuring the fraction of invisible dark hadrons. The presence of ISR facilitates the identification of the SVJs, and the resulting boost improves the resolution of the observables, especially for models with high invisible fractions. We combine the two observables to propose a complete search strategy and discuss an extension of the strategy to probe the whole model parameter space.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up approach to texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate one and two texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix using the latest oscillation data through a bottom-up approach. In this context, we begin by estimating the detailed features of each matrix element by varying the CP violating phases within $(0,\,2\pi)$, the lowest neutrino mass within $(0,\,1)\,{\rm eV}$ and the neutrino oscillation parameters such as three mixing angles and the two mass squared differences within $3\sigma$ of their central values. We find that for normal ordering, only $ee$, $e\mu$ and $e\tau$ elements of the mass matrix can vanish, whereas, for inverted ordering, five elements -- $e\mu$, $e\tau$, $\mu\mu$, $\mu\tau$ and $\tau\tau$ -- can vanish. For two texture zeros, only $(ee,\, e\mu = 0)$ and $(ee,\, e\tau =0)$ are allowed in case of normal ordering. For a particular vanishing element, we also estimate the range of the lowest neutrino mass and the CP violating phases. In particular, very interesting correlation among the CP violating phases and the lowest neutrino mass is obtained for each vanishing cases.</description>

      <title>Reduction to master integrals and transverse integration identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction of Feynman integrals to a basis of linearly independent master integrals is a pivotal step in loop calculations, but also one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we assess the impact of using transverse integration identities for the reduction to master integrals. Given an integral family, some of its sectors correspond to diagrams with fewer external legs or to diagrams that can be factorized as products of lower-loop integrals. Using transverse integration identities, i.e. a tensor decomposition in the subspace that is transverse to the external momenta of the diagrams, one can map integrals belonging to such sectors and their subsectors to (products of) integrals belonging to new and simpler integral families, characterized by either fewer generalized denominators, fewer external invariants, fewer loops or combinations thereof. Integral reduction is thus drastically simpler for these new families. We describe a proof-of-concept implementation of the application of transverse integration identities in the context of integral reduction. We include some applications to cutting-edge integral families, showing significant improvements over traditional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Medium-induced parton splitting in expanding QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the approach derived by Caron-Huot and Gale from the BDMPS-Z formalism, we obtain medium-induced parton splitting rates in a Bjorken expanding QCD matter. We compare the rate with the case of a static medium and investigate the impact of the medium expansion on the splitting rate. We also consider the leading order in the opacity expansion and the harmonic oscillator solution. These approximations are recovered in the limits of small and large formation times, respectively.</description>

      <title>Loop quantum effects on direct detection prediction in two-scalar dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of quantum corrections on the elastic scattering cross section of dark matter off nucleus in two-scalar dark matter model. Among two extra singlet scalars in two-scalar model, the lighter one is stable and plays the role of dark matter candidate and the heavier one contributes in dark matter coannihilation processes in thermal history of the early universe. It is already known that the two-scalar model at tree level, in spite of the single-scalar dark matter model, can easily evade the bounds from direct detection (DD) experiments. The claim here is that taking into account the loop effects, in some regions of the parameter space, the DM-nucleon cross section becomes larger than the tree level contribution. Therefore, loop effects move the regions which were below the neutrino floor at tree level, up to the regions which are detectable by future DD experiments.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm ${\cal P}_{cs}(4338)^0$ production in baryonic $B^-\to J/\psi \Lambda\bar p$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the resonant baryonic $B$ decay $B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p,{\cal P}_{cs}^0\to J/\psi \Lambda$, where ${\cal P}_{cs}^0\equiv {\cal P}_{cs}(4338)^0$ is identified as a hidden charm pentaquark candidate with strangeness. By interpreting ${\cal P}_{cs}^0$ as the $\Xi_c\bar D$ molecule that strongly decays into $J/\psi\Lambda$ and $\eta_c\Lambda$, we discover a dominant triangle rescattering effect for $B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p$, initiated by $B^-\to J/\psi K^-$. Through the exchange of a $\bar \Lambda$ anti-baryon, $J/\psi$ and $K^-$ undergo rescattering, transforming into ${\cal P}_{cs}^0$ and $\bar p$, respectively. Based on this rescattering mechanism, we calculate ${\cal B}(B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p,{\cal P}_{cs}^0\to J/\psi \Lambda) =(1.7^{+1.2}_{-0.8})\times10^{-6}$, which is consistent with the measured data.</description>

      <title>Contact interaction treatment of $\mathcal{V}\to\mathcal{P}\gamma$ for light-quark mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{V}\to\mathcal{P}\gamma$ and $\eta(\eta^\prime) \to \gamma\gamma$ decays are evaluated within a Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations framework (here $\mathcal{V}=\{\rho^{\pm},K^{\star\pm},\phi\}$ and $\mathcal{P}=\{\pi^{\pm},K^{\pm},\eta,\eta^{\prime}\}$). The so-called impulse approximation (IA) is employed in the computation of the decay constants involved and decay widths, and so in the estimation of the associated charge and interaction radii. For their part, the required propagators and vertices stem from a contact interaction model, embedded within a beyond rainbow-ladder (RL) truncation that accounts for the typical ladder exchanges, quark anomalous magnetic moment, as well as the non-Abelian anomaly. While the examined transitions produce decay widths plainly compatible with the available experimental data, those processes involving the $\eta-\eta'$ mesons highlight the incompleteness of the IA when considering beyond RL effects in the interaction kernels.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter and the thermal history of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In metric $f(R)$ gravity minimally coupled to the Standard Model, the scalaron could act as dark matter if its mass falls within the range $4.4~\text{meV} \lesssim m \lesssim 1.2~\text{MeV}$. The dynamics of the scalaron in the universe is influenced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor. In our previous studies, we focused on the classical contribution to this trace generated by the Higgs field. At the onset of the electroweak crossover, its evolution is nonadiabatic with respect to the scalaron mass, and the scalaron experiences a perturbation that can trigger its oscillations. However, the trace of the stress-energy tensor also includes a time-dependent component due to the QCD trace anomaly. In this paper, we revisit the cosmological scenario for scalaron evolution by incorporating the trace anomaly at high temperatures. We show that, while this anomaly produces a shift in the equilibrium value of the scalaron, the evolution of this shift remains adiabatic with respect to the rapid oscillations of the scalaron. Consequently, possible cosmological scenarios for the scalaron evolution are qualitatively unaffected by this correction.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor-asymmetric pseudoscalar mesons on the light front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extract the leading Fock-state light front wave functions (LF-LFWFs) of heavy flavor-asymmetric pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $B$ and $B_c$ from their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions based on Dyson-Schwinger equations approach, and study their leading twist parton distribution amplitudes, generalized parton distribution functions and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. The spatial distributions of the quark and antiquark on the transverse plane are given, along with their charge and energy distributions on the light front. We find that in the considered mesons, the heavier quarks carry most longitudinal momentum fraction and yield narrow $x$-distributions, while the lighter quarks play an active role in shaping the transverse distributions within both spatial and momentum space, exhibiting a duality embodying characteristics from both light mesons and heavy quarkonium.</description>

      <title>A novel standard candle: collapsing axion stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, is a crucial parameter in cosmology. However, various cosmic observations have produced differing posterior values for $H_0$, resulting in what is referred to as the $H_0$ tension. To resolve this discrepancy, utilizing other cosmological probes to constrain $H_0$ is advantageous. In the quest to identify dark matter candidates, the QCD axion and axionlike particles, collectively referred to as axions, have become leading contenders. These elusive particles can coalesce into dense structures known as axion stars via Bose-Einstein condensation. When these axion stars exceed a critical mass, typically through accretion or merging, they experience a self-induced collapse. This process results in short radio bursts, assuming a decay constant $f_a\lesssim10^{13}{\rm{GeV}}$, with the frequency depending on the axion mass and the luminosity determined by both the axion mass and decay constant. Therefore, we propose that collapsing axion stars could serve as a novel standard candle to constrain $H_0$. Even more interesting is that the radio bursts emitted by collapsing axion stars with specific parameters match the characteristics of observed non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Thus, FRBs generated by collapsing axion stars have the potential to be used as standard candles to constrain $H_0$.</description>

Abstract: Analysis of normalised C-moments of multiplicity distribution calculated from the different phenomenological models, the Bialas-Praszalowics~(BP) model, modified negative binomial and the superposed SGD at different center of mass~(cms) energies is presented.~The analysis covers a range of energies~(200-900 GeV) of $\bar{p}p$ collisions in restricted phase space slices.~A comparison of different models to the experimental data on charged particle multiplicity spectra from the $\bar{p}p$ annihilation in five pseudorapidity windows is reported.~The comparison shows that the two approaches other than the BP model are in better agreement to the data.~Results on variation of moments with pseudorapidity window size and with center of mass energy and observations from such a study in $\bar{p}p$ annihilation and $pp$ interactions at the same cms energy are also presented.</description>

      <title>A study of the $\phi N$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The femtoscopic $\phi N$ correlation function is studied within a hadronic effective Lagrangian approach with coupled channels, based on hidden local symmetry. The results are compared with the data recently reported by the ALICE collaboration. We find that the correlation function has very different features for the $\phi N$ system in the spin 1/2 and 3/2 configurations, with the spin-averaged combination matching well with the experimental data. A strong attraction, leading to the formation of a $\phi N$ bound state or a very prominent cusp is found in the spin 3/2 case. The correlation function for spin 1/2, on the other hand, is strongly impacted by the negative parity $N^*(1895)$ nucleon resonance.</description>

      <title>Yukawa textures from non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenomenological aspects of non-invertible symmetries, in particular the flavor structure of quarks and leptons, are studied. We start with a $\mathbb{Z}_M$ discrete symmetry and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_2$ so as to obtain a non-invertible symmetry. We study which Yukawa textures can be derived from the non-invertible symmetries. Various textures can be realized and some of them cannot be realized by a conventional symmetry. For example, the nearest neighbor interaction texture as well as other interesting textures of quarks and leptons are obtained.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $a_0$, $f_0$, $f_2$, and $K^*_2$ resonances as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Influences of non-standard interactions on PeV neutrino events with and without a $L_{\alpha}-L_{\beta}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported astrophysical neutrinos events in the TeV-PeV energy range open a winder to explore new physics at energy frontiers. In this paper, we examine effects of non-standard interactions (NSIs) on the PeV neutrinos events. We consider NSIs with and without a gauge symmetry $L_{\alpha}$ - $L_{\beta}$. We find that, for typical $\mu^{\pm}$ damping and $\pi^{\pm}$ decay sources, the NSI with an extra gauge symmetry has more noticeable effects on the PeV events. Therefore, the detection of the events in the upcoming experiments could set stringent constraints on the NSI parameters in the $L_{\alpha}$ - $L_{\beta}$ symmetric case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mass spectra and radiative decays of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}^{\prime}(2460)$ in an unquenched framework. In addition to coupled channel effects between the $c\bar{s}$ cores and $D^{(*)}K$ channels, $D^{(*)}K$-$D^{(*)}K$ self interactions are also considered in this work and we succeed to reproduce their mass spectra. Furthermore, we study the radiative decays of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}^{\prime}(2460)$ by simultaneously including the compound structures of conventional $c\bar{s}$ cores and $D^{(*)}K$ components. We also calculate their bottom analogs with heavy quark symmetry. Our study offers useful insights into the important unquenched effects in the formation of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, $D_{s1}^{\prime}(2460)$ and the bottom counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the valence quark transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, pions, in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature by employing a light-cone quark model. The medium modifications in the pion unpolarized TMDs are induced through the effective quark masses computed using the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. The spin densities at different momentum fraction ($x$) have also been calculated at different baryonic densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a relative P-wave to construct the vector doubly-charm diquark $(\widetilde{V})$ therefore the scalar and tensor tetraquark currents to investigate the decay widths of the fully-charm tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$ via the QCD sum rules. We observe that the total width of the ground state $\widetilde{V}\overline{\widetilde{V}}$-type scalar tetraquark state is compatible with that of the $X(6552)$ within the range of uncertainties, and the branching ratios are quite different from that of the first radial excitation of the $A\bar{A}$-type scalar tetraquark state. Other predictions can be verified in the future experiments to shed light on the nature of the fully-charm tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Dark QCD perspective inspired by strong CP problem at QCD scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a QCD-scale composite axion model arising from dark QCD coupled to QCD. The presently proposed scenario not only solves the strong CP problem, but also is compatible with the preheating setup for the QCD baryogenesis. The composite axion is phenomenologically required to mimic the QCD pion, but can generically be flavorful, which could be testable via the induced flavor changing processes at experiments. Another axionlike particle (ALP) is predicted to achieve the axion relaxation mechanism, which can phenomenologically act as the conventional QCD axion. This ALP can be ultralight, having the mass less than 1 eV, to be a dark matter candidate. The QCD $\times$ dark QCD symmetry structure constrains dark QCD meson spectra, so that the dark $\eta'$-like meson would only be accessible at the collider experiments. Still, the Belle II experiment can have a high enough sensitivity to probe the dark $\eta$-like meson decaying to diphoton, which dominantly arises from the mixing with the QCD $\eta'$ and the pionic composite axion. We also briefly address nontrivial cosmological aspects, such as those related to the dark-chiral phase transition, the dark matter production, and an ultraviolet completion related to the ultralight ALP.</description>

      <title>Multi-label Classification of Parameter Constraints in BSM Extensions using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shortcomings of the Standard Model (SM) motivate its extension to accommodate new expected phenomena, such as dark matter and neutrino masses. However, such extensions are generally more complex due to the presence of a larger number of free parameters as well as additional phenomenology. Understanding how current theoretical and experimental constraints, individually and collectively, affect the parameter spaces of new models is of utmost importance in achieving testable predictions and targeted model-building that aims to solve certain issues. We present a comprehensive approach of using Deep Learning (DL) for the multi-label classification (MLC) of theoretical and experimental limits on the two-Higgs doublet model augmented by a real singlet (N2HDM), as a representative case. This approach can be generalized to any extension beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at the LHC with rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma, leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC energies. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as charged particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged-particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a similar quantitative enhancement as seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>

      <title>On the model uncertainties for the predicted maximum depth of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative analysis of model uncertainties for calculations of the maximum depth of proton-initiated extensive air showers (EAS) has been performed. Staying within the standard physics picture and using the conventional approach to the treatment of high energy interactions, we found that present uncertainties on the energy dependence of the inelastic cross section, the rate of diffraction, and the inelasticity of hadronic collisions allow one to increase the predicted average EAS maximum depth by about 10 g/cm$^2$. Invoking more exotic assumptions regarding a potentially significant modification of the parton hadronization procedure by hypothetical collective effects, we were able to change drastically the predicted energy dependence of the inelasticity of proton-air interactions and to increase thereby the predicted EAS maximum depth by up to $\simeq 30$ g/cm$^2$. However, those latter modifications are disfavored by the data of the LHCf experiment, regarding forward neutron production in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and by measurements of the muon production depth by the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>CP violation in two-meson Tau decays induced by heavy new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the effective field theory formalism that was used to study CP violation induced by heavy new physics in the $\tau\to K_S \pi\nu_\tau$ decays to the other two-meson tau decay channels. We focus on the rate and the forward-backward asymmetries, that are predicted using current bounds on the complex Wilson coefficients of the effective Lagrangian. We discuss our outcomes for the modes with $(K/\pi)\pi^0$ and $K K_S$, that can be studied at Belle-II and a super-tau-charm facility. Our main finding is that current and forthcoming experiments would be sensitive to the maximum allowed CP rate asymmetry in the $K^\pm K_S$ modes if a precision of $5\%$ is reached on this observable. For the $\pi^\pm\pi^0$ channels, new physics would be best probed through the forward-backward asymmetry. Disentangling new sources of CP violation would be most challenging in $K^\pm\pi^0$ and the other modes.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space. We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.\end{abstract}</description>

      <title>New Search for Dark Matter with Neutrons at Neutrino Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-volume neutrino experiments are ideal for testing boosted dark matter (BDM) scenarios. We propose, for the first time, an approach to utilize knockout neutrons by detecting de-excitation $\gamma$ rays and coincident captured neutrons from dark-matter interactions with bound neutrons in oxygen, while previous studies have focused on knockout-protons and electrons. This method is especially crucial for water \v{C}erenkov detectors, where high proton \v{C}erenkov threshold ($\sim$1 GeV) suppresses signal acceptance. Recently, Super-Kamiokande (SK) was doped with 0.03\% gadolinium (SK-Gd) to enhance neutron tagging efficiency. Using SK-Gd as a target experiment, we demonstrate that this method increases sensitivity to BDM models by an order of magnitude compared to proton-based analysis, and it allows exploration of a wider range of light dark-matter models previously inaccessible with proton-based analysis. We also present the projected sensitivity for the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative expansions for atoms in QED are developed around interacting states, typically defined by the Schr\"odinger equation. Calculations are nevertheless done using the standard Feynman diagram expansion around free states. The classical $-\alpha/r$ potential is then obtained through an infinite sum of ladder diagrams. The complexity of this approach may have contributed to bound states being omitted from QFT textbooks, restricting the field to select experts.
  The confinement scale 1 fm of QCD must be introduced without changing the Lagrangian. This can be done via a boundary condition on the gauge field, which affects the bound state potential. The absence of confinement in Feynman diagrams may be due to the free field boundary condition.
  Poincar\'e invariance is realized dynamically for bound states, i.e., the interactions are frame dependent. Gauge theories have instantaneous interactions, due to gauge fixing at all points of space at the same time. In bound state perturbation theory each order must have exact Poincar\'e invariance. This is non-trivial even for atoms at lowest order.
  I summarize a perturbative approach to equal time bound states in QED and QCD, using a Fock expansion in temporal ($A^0=0$) gauge. The longitudinal electric field $E_L$ is instantaneous and need not vanish at spatial infinity for the constituents of color singlet states in QCD. Poincar\'e covariance determines the boundary condition for $E_L$ up to a universal scale, characterised by the gluon field energy density of the vacuum. A non-vanishing density contributes a linear term to the $q\bar{q}$ potential, while $qqq,\ q\bar{q}g$ and $gg$ color singlet states get analogous confining potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NLO QCD results for Higgs boson production in association with one jet, including anomalous Higgs-top and effective Higgs-gluon couplings within non-linear Effective Field Theory (HEFT), as well as the full top quark mass dependence. We provide differential results for the Higgs boson transverse momentum spectrum at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV and discuss the effects of the anomalous couplings.</description>

      <title>Exclusive vector-quarkonium photoproduction at NLO in alpha_s in collinear factorisation with evolution of the generalised parton distributions and high-energy resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first complete one-loop study of exclusive photoproduction of vector quarkonia off protons in Collinear Factorisation (CF) including the scale evolution of the Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs). We confirm the perturbative instability of the cross section at high photon-proton-collision energies (W_gamma+p) at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in alpha_s and solve this issue by resumming higher-order QCD corrections, which are enhanced by a logarithm of the parton energies, using High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) in the Doubly-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA) matched to CF. Our NLO CF + DLA HEF results are in agreement with the latest HERA data, show a smaller sensitivity to the factorisation and renormalisation scales compared to Born-order results. Quark-induced channels via interference with gluon ones are found to contribute at most 20% of the cross section for W_gamma+p &gt; 100 GeV. Our results also show that such exclusive cross sections cannot be accurately obtained from the square of usual Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and clearly illustrate the importance of quarkonium exclusive photoproduction to advance our understanding of the 3D content of the nucleon in terms of gluons. Our work provides an important step towards a correct interpretation of present and future experimental data collected at HERA, the EIC, the LHC and future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quantitative results for masses and the internal structure of four-quark states with two heavy quarks, i.e. $QQ'\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ with $Q,Q'\in \{c,b\}$ and $q,q' \in \{u,d,s\}$, and $J^{P} \in {1^+}$. The composition of these states in terms of meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark pairs, extracted from a relativistic four-body Faddeev-Yakubowski equation, is dynamically determined from underlying QCD forces. We find states at energy levels in very good agreement with lattice QCD and, where available, with experimental states. Their internal structure, most notably between the $T^+_{cc}$, $T^+_{bc}$ and $T^+_{bb}$, show significant and sizeable variations.</description>

      <title>How to unravel the nature of the $\Sigma^*(1430) (1/2^-)$ state from correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions for the $\bar K^0 p, \pi^+ \Sigma^0, \pi^0 \Sigma^+, \pi^+ \Lambda$, and $\eta \Sigma^+$ states, which in the chiral unitary approach predict an excited $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ state at the $\bar K N$ threshold, recently observed by the Belle collaboration. Once this is done, we tackle the inverse problem of seeing how much information one can obtain from these correlation functions. With the resampling method, one can determine the scattering parameters of all the channels with relative precision by means of the analysis in a general framework, and find a clear cusp-like structure corresponding to the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ in the different amplitudes at the $\bar{K}N$ threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum angular moment transport schemes are an important avenue toward describing neutrino flavor mixing phenomena in dense astrophysical environments such as supernovae and merging neutron stars. Successful implementation will require new closure relations that go beyond those used in classical transport. In this paper, we derive the first analytic expression for a quantum M1 closure, valid in the limit of small flavor coherence, based on the maximum entropy principle. We verify that the resulting closure relation has the appropriate limits and characteristic speeds in the diffusive and free-streaming regimes. We then use this new closure in a moment linear stability analysis to search for fast flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger simulation and find better results as compared with previously designed, ad hoc, semi-classical closures.</description>

      <title>QCD-sourced tachyonic phase transition in a supercooled Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel gravitational wave production mechanism in the context of quasi-conformal Standard Model extensions, which provide a way to dynamically generate the electroweak scale. In these models, the cosmic thermal history is modified by a substantial period of thermal inflation, potentially supercooling the Universe below the QCD scale. The exit from supercooling is typically realized through a strong, first-order phase transition. By employing the classically conformal $U(1)_{\tiny\rm B-L}$ model as a representative example, we show that a large parameter space exists where bubble percolation is inefficient. Instead, the top quark condensate triggers a tachyonic phase transition driven by classical rolling of the new scalar field towards the true vacuum. As the field crosses a region where its effective mass is negative, long-wavelength scalar field fluctuations are exponentially amplified, preheating the supercooled Universe. We study the dynamics of this scenario and estimate the peak of the associated gravitational wave signal, which is detectable by future observatories in almost the entire available parameter space.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically conformal CFL quark matter within a nonlocal chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a three-flavor nonlocal NJL model of quark matter with the scalar attractive, vector repulsive and diquark pairing interaction channels. The model is treated within the separable approximation to obtain the EoS of cold quark matter. The analysis of the high density asymptotics of the model allows us to conclude about its qualitative agreement with the perturbative QCD. Particularly, a color superconducting CFL state is found to be the ground one at high densities. The conformal limit of speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure are also shown to be reached from below and above, respectively. The model is applied to modelling NSs within the scenario of early quark deconfinement triggered by the gravitational instability of the NS matter due to the BEC of a spin-color-flavor singlet three-diquark bound state, the light sexaquark, stable against the weak and strong decays. A conservative estimate of the sexaquark mass based on the most up-to-date results from QCD sum rules and a constituent quark model assumes an early quark deconfinement with the onset mass below $1~\rm M_\odot$. The scenario is shown to be consistent with the present observational constraints on the mass-radius relation and tidal deformability of NSs. Given the fact that the proposed model by construction exhibits an asymptotically conformal behavior, we consider the question about approximately conformal quark matter in NSs. We report a non-perturbative energy density range, which is inaccessible in NSs and where the speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure of the CFL quark matter simultaneously attain the conformal values.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos with gravitational wave and $\gamma$-ray burst joint observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to detect them. Future gravitational wave (GW) observations can precisely measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies generated by traditional cosmological observations. This advancement can lead to much tighter constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. This work provides a preliminary forecast for detecting sterile neutrinos using third-generation GW detectors in combination with future short $\gamma$-ray burst observations from a THESEUS-like telescope, an approach not previously explored in the literature. Both massless and massive sterile neutrinos are considered within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that using GW data can greatly enhance the detection capability for massless sterile neutrinos, reaching 3$\sigma$ level. For massive sterile neutrinos, GW data can also greatly assist in improving the parameter constraints, but it seems that effective detection is still not feasible.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass ($M_{\rm PBH}\in[10^{17},10^{23}]$ g) make up the entire dark matter they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of primordial black holes are performed. We show that the perturbations are too small to be directly detectable with current data, challenging recent results that have ruled out PBHs as a dark matter candidate. Using the Earth-Mars system as an observational probe, we estimate that an improvement in the measurement accuracy by more than an order of magnitude is required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Shift operators and momentum-space conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A momentum-space approach to conformal field theory offers a new perspective on cosmological correlators and better reveals the underlying connections to scattering amplitudes. This thesis explores the interplay between integral representations and shift operators.
  A representation for the general $n$-point function of scalar operators was recently proposed in the form of a Feynman integral with the topology of an $(n-1)$-simplex, featuring an arbitrary function of momentum-space cross ratios. We show the graph polynomials for this integral can all be expressed in terms of the first and second minors of the Laplacian matrix for the simplex. Computing the effective resistance between nodes of the corresponding electrical network, an inverse parametrisation is found in terms of the determinant and first minors of the Cayley-Menger matrix. These parametrisations reveal new families of shift operators expressible as determinants that connect $n$-point functions in spacetime dimensions differing by two. Furthermore, they enable the validity of the conformal Ward identities to be established directly without recourse to recursion in the number of points.
  We then analyse the representation of conformal and Feynman integrals through a class of multivariable hypergeometric functions proposed by Gelfand, Kapranov \&amp; Zelevinsky. Among other advantages, this formalism enables the systematic construction of highly non-trivial weight-shifting operators known as ``creation'' operators. We discuss these operators emphasising their close connection to the spectral singularities that arise for special parameter values, and their relationship to the Newton polytope of the integrand. Via these methods we construct novel weight-shifting operators connecting contact Witten diagrams of different operator and spacetime dimensions, as well as exchange diagrams with purely non-derivative vertices.</description>

      <title>Phases and Phase transitions of U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetric holographic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase diagram and symmetry breaking patterns of a holographic CFT with U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetry are analyzed using the simplest holographic action, namely Einstein-Yang-Mills (YM) theory with a negative cosmological constant. This is relevant for both condensed matter and QCD applications. With a U(1) and an "isospin" chemical potential turned on, we determine all possible symmetry breaking patterns, which are associated to the condensation of spin-one order parameters. The possible IR asymptotics of the Einstein-YM solutions are derived analytically, both for 2+1 and 3+1 boundary dimensions. The competing solutions are then computed numerically, both at zero and non-zero temperature, from which the full three-dimensional phase diagram is determined. We find a surface of second order phase transitions that separate uncondensed and condensed phases. In some regions with a large fraction of charged to neutral degrees of freedom, the phase transition becomes first order.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced dark matter detection with in-cavity control: mitigating the Rayleigh curse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is a fundamental puzzle in modern physics. A major approach of searching for dark matter relies on detecting feeble noise in microwave cavities. However, the quantum advantages of common quantum resources such as squeezing are intrinsically limited by the Rayleigh curse -- a constant loss places a sensitivity upper bound on these quantum resources. In this paper, we propose an in-situ protocol to mitigate such Rayleigh limit. The protocol consists of three steps: in-cavity quantum state preparation, axion accumulation with tunable time duration, and measurement. For the quantum source, we focus on the single-mode squeezed state (SMSS), and the entanglement-assisted case using signal-ancilla pairs in two-mode squeezed state (TMSS), where the ancilla does not interact with the axion. From quantum Fisher information rate evaluation, we derive the requirement of cavity quality factor, thermal noise level and squeezing gain for quantum advantage. When the squeezing gain becomes larger, the optimal axion accumulation time decreases to reduce loss and mitigate the Rayleigh curse -- the quantum advantage keeps increasing with the squeezing gain. Overall, we find that TMSS is more sensitive in the low temperature limit. In the case of SMSS, as large gain is required for advantage over vacuum, homodyne is sufficient to achieve optimality. For TMSS, anti-squeezing and photon counting is necessary to be optimal. Thanks to the recent advance in magnetic-field-resilient in-cavity squeezing and rapidly coupling out for photon counting, the proposed protocol is compatible with axion detection scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measures of fast radio bursts have been identified as a powerful tool for testing the zero-mass hypothesis of the photon. The classical approach treats the massive photon-induced and plasma-induced time delays as two separate phenomena. Recently, Wang et al. (2024) suggested that the joint influence of the nonzero photon mass and plasma effects should be considered, and proposed a revised time delay for massive photons propagating in a plasma medium, denoted as $\Delta t'_{m_{\gamma}} \propto \nu^{-4}$, which departures from the classical dispersion relation ($\propto \nu^{-2}$). Here we discuss the derivation presented by Wang et al. (2024) and show that the classical dispersion relation remains valid based on Proca equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, theoretical studies on the bumblebee gravity model, a nonminimally-coupled vector-tensor theory that violates the Lorentz symmetry, have flourished, with a simultaneous increase in the utilization of observations to impose constraints. The static spherical solutions of neutron stars (NSs) in the bumblebee theory are calculated comprehensively in this work. These solutions with different coupling constants reveal a rich theoretical landscape for NSs, including vectorized NSs and NSs with finite radii but divergent masses. With these solutions, preliminary constraints on the asymptotic vector field values are obtained through restrictions on the stellar radius.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry in the Seiberg-Witten Theory: A Window into Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take supersymmetry in the Seiberg-Witten theory as a case study of the uses of (super)symmetry arguments in studying the ontology of four-dimensional interacting quantum field theories. Together with a double expansion, supersymmetry is a via media that helps to bridge the gap between the ontologies of an exact quantum field theory and its semi-classical limit. We discuss a class of states that exist at any value of the coupling, and whose properties such as mass, electric and magnetic charges, and spin quantum numbers can be precisely characterised at low energies. The low-energy theory is best presented as a one-dimensional complex manifold, equipped with metric and other structures: namely, the space of low-energy vacua, covered by three open regions that are interpreted as macroscopic phases. We discuss two cases of emergence: the emergence of the low-energy regime and the emergence between models at low energies, thereby highlighting the significance of the topology of the space of vacua for such cases of emergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze lensing of photons and neutrinos in a gravitational field, proposing a method to include radiative effects in classical lens equations. The study uses Schwarzschild and a Reissner-Nordstrom metrics expanded at second post Newtonian order in the Newtonian potential, employing a semiclassical approach to compare one-loop corrections from the Standard Model with Einstein's deflection formula via an impact parameter representation. We also explore the energy dependence of deflection due to quantum corrections and integrate these with classical lens equations.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave analysis to determine the spin of $\Xi(1690)^-$ and $\Xi(1820)^-$ produced in $\overline{p}p$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently [arXiv:2201.03852v2] the PANDA collaboration studied the feasibility of determining the spin and parity of the $\Xi(1690)^{-}$and $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ resonances in the $\Lambda K^-$ system produced in $\bar{p}p$ collisions via the reaction channel $\overline{p} p \rightarrow \bar{\Xi}^{+} \Lambda K^{-}$. This contribution aims to study these reactions using a model-independent irreducible tensor formalism developed earlier. This study leads us to identify the partial-wave amplitude, which would be zero if $\Xi(1690)^{-}$ or $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ had spin-1/2, provided these resonances are produced at threshold (s-wave production).</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparencies with a two step process of the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear transparency in pion-induced nuclear reactions has been investigated on the basis of Glauber multiple scattering theory considering a two-step process within the framework of vector meson dominance (VMD). In the present context, the application of the quantum diffusion model (QDM) to the Glauber theory plays a role in explaining the dependence of the transparency on the four momentum transfer squared $Q^2$. % as shown in the experimental data. The short-range correlation (SRC) considered further gives the contribution to the magnitude of the transparency by a constant amount independent of the $Q^2$ variation, and the results from the QDM and SRC overestimate the experimental data. The inclusion of the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section, $\sigma_{\rho N}=3 $ mb has the effect of reducing the transparency and thus leads to a good agreement with the experimental data on the reaction $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <title>Confronting new NICER mass-radius measurements with phase transition in dense matter and compact twin stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (re)analysis of data on the X-ray emitting pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as new results on PSR J0437-4715, are confronted with the predictions of the equation of state (EoS) models allowing for strong first-order phase transition for the mass-radius ($M$-$R$) diagram. We use models that are based on a covariant density functional (CDF) EoS for nucleonic matter at low densities and a quark matter EoS, parameterized by the speed of sound, at higher densities. To account for the variations in the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 obtained from different analyses, we examined three scenarios to assess their consistency with our models, focusing particularly on the potential formation of twin stars. We found that in two scenarios, where the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437-4715 with masses close to the canonical mass $\sim 1.4\,M_{\odot}$ are significantly separated, our models allow for the presence of twin stars as a natural explanation for potential differences in the radii of these stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator-type Hamiltonians, it is shown that there is a relation between the energy eigenvalues of parity symmetric and PT-symmetric phases for weak coupling. The possibility of such a relation was conjectured by Ai, Bender and Sarkar on examining the imaginary part of the ground state energy using path integrals. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the conjecture is true also for the real part of the ground state energy and of the excited state energies. However, the conjecture is false for strong coupling. The analogous relation for partition functions in zero spacetime dimensions is valid for many cases, except for multi-component scalar fields in strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Emergent chirality and superfluidity of parity-doubled baryons in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose novel superfluids induced by the parity-doubled baryons. The parity-doubled baryons, i.e., a nucleon $N(940)$ with spin-parity $J^{P}=1/2^{+}$ and an excited nucleon $N^{\ast}(1535)$ with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ in vacuum, become degenerate at sufficiently high density where the chiral symmetry is restored. In this study, we extend the conventional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ chiral symmetry to the higher dimensional symmetries, dubbed emergent chiral symmetries, including the naive and mirror assignments as their subgroups. Starting with the Lagrangian up to four-point interactions among the neutron $n$ and its chiral partner $n^{\ast}$, neutral components in $N$ and $N^{\ast}$, in pure neutron matter, we investigate the properties of the ground state with a pairing gap generated by the $n$ and $n^{\ast}$ in the mean-field approximation. We find vector-type condensates that induce the dynamical breaking of a new class of internal symmetries, emergent chiral symmetries, as well as the baryon number and the rotational symmetries of the real space, indicating the appearance of massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons consisting of six quarks: emergent pions, superfluid phonons, and magnons, respectively. We also study the fermionic excitation modes at low-energy scales, and show that they exhibit a spatial anisotropy of the propagation at the Dirac cone in momentum space. Some phenomenological implications are advocated, shedding new light on the properties of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to a simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the color degree of freedom is required even at the low energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>A universal implementation of radiative effects in neutrino event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the similarities between electron-nucleus ($eA$) and neutrino-nucleus scattering ($\nu A$), $eA$ data can contribute key information to improve cross-section modeling in $eA$ and hence in $\nu A$ event generators. However, to compare data and generated events, either the data must be radiatively corrected or radiative effects need to be included in the event generators. We implemented a universal radiative corrections program that can be used with all reaction mechanisms and any $eA$ event generator. Our program includes real photon radiation by the incident and scattered electrons, and virtual photon exchange and photon vacuum polarization diagrams. It uses the ``extended peaking" approximation for electron radiation and neglects charged hadron radiation. This method, validated with GENIE, can also be extended to simulate $\nu A$ radiative effects. This work facilitates data-event-generator comparisons used to improve $\nu A$ event generators for the next-generation of neutrino experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach aimed at addressing the longstanding baryon-anti-baryon asymmetry conundrum. Our proposed mechanism suggests that baryon numbers were generated during the inflationary epoch through the dynamics of the inflaton field coupled with an explicit baryon number violating interaction. Notably, during inflation, it is possible to halt the baryon number generation process via a symmetry restoration phase transition. We elucidate that prior to this phase transition, baryon numbers could be synthesized and preserved within classical field configurations. Subsequently, following the phase transition, these baryon numbers were liberated as particles. Crucially, we demonstrate that this mechanism of baryon number production is intricately linked with significant cosmological collider signals and gravitational wave (GW) signals, offering a compelling framework to explore the origins of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), which can unveil the formation of primordial seeds of inhomogeneities in the early universe. With the SGWB parameters inferred from PTAs data, we can make a prediction of the seeds for early galaxy formation from the domain walls in the axion-like particles (ALPs) field distribution. This also naturally provides a solution to the observation of high redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope. The predicted photon coupling of the ALP is within the reach of future experimental searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$ spectra and anisotropic flow distributions are studied for charmonia and charmed hadrons produced in Pb-Pb collisions and measured with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The investigations are performed within the framework of the Statistical Hadronization Model with the transverse dynamics evaluated using predictions from relativistic viscous hydrodynamics as implemented in the computer codes MUSIC and FluiduM. With this essentially parameter-free approach, mostly good agreement is obtained for $p_{\rm T}$ spectra in the range $p_{\rm T}$ $&lt; 10$ GeV/c. The calculations suggest a hardening of the ${\rm J}/\psi$ $p_{\rm T}$ distribution for more central collisions while the data show the opposite trend. The observed wide distribution in $p_{\rm T}$ of anisotropic flow coefficients v$_2$ and v$_3$ for charmonia is also well reproduced, while their magnitude is generally somewhat over predicted. This finding may be connected to a difference in spatial distribution between light and charmed hadrons due to a different diffusion of light and heavy quarks in the hot fireball.</description>

Abstract: We study the decay of $B^+$ meson into $K^+$ plus a light mediator $\phi$, which subsequently decays into a dark matter pair, $\bar \chi \chi$. Integrating constraints from DM relic density, direct detection, collider data and $B$-physics, alongside the recently reported results form Belle II experiment, we analyze the couplings between the mediator, standard model fermions, and the dark matter particles. Our results indicate that if the decay process $\phi \rightarrow \bar \chi \chi$ is kinematically allowed, i.e. $m_\phi &gt; 2m_\chi$, then the mediator mass must be constrained within 0.35 GeV $\lesssim m_\phi \lesssim$ 3 GeV. Conversely, if $m_\phi &lt; 2m_\chi$, the mediator $m_\phi$ is long-lived relative to the detector size, and the only allowed decay channel is $\phi \rightarrow e^+ e^-$.</description>

      <title>CGC/saturation approach: Impact-parameter dependent model of perturbative QCD and combined HERA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we confront the CGC/saturation approach of Ref.~\cite{CLMS} with the experimental combined HERA data and obtain its parameters. The model includes two features that are in accordance with our theoretical knowledge of deep inelastic scattering. These consist of: \textit{i}) the use of analytical solution for the non-linear Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution equation and \textit{ii}) the exponential behavior of the saturation momentum on the impact parameter $b$-dependence, characterized by $Q_s$ $\propto\exp(-mb)$ which reproduces the correct behavior of the scattering amplitude at large $b$ in accord with Froissart theorem. The model results are then compared to data at small-$x$ for the structure-function of the proton $F_{2}$, the longitudinal structure function $F_{L}$, the charm structure function $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$, the exclusive vector meson ($J/\psi,\phi,\rho$) production and Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS). We obtain a good agreement for the processes in a wide kinematic range of $Q^2$ at small-$x$. Our results provide a strong guide for finding an approach, based on Color Glass Condensate/saturation effective theory for high energy QCD, to make reliable predictions from first principles and for forthcoming experiments like the Electron-Ion Collider and the LHeC.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Nulling and Vacuum Radio Emission from Axion Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-relativistic axions can be efficiently produced in in the polar caps of pulsars, resulting in the formation of a dense cloud of gravitationally bound axions. Here, we investigate the interplay between such an axion cloud and the electrodynamics in the pulsar magnetosphere, focusing specifically on the dynamics in the polar caps, where the impact of the axion cloud is expected to be most pronounced. For sufficiently light axions $m_a \lesssim 10^{-7}$ eV, we show that the axion cloud can occasionally screen the local electric field responsible for particle acceleration and pair production, inducing a periodic nulling of the pulsar's intrinsic radio emission. At larger axion masses, the small-scale fluctuations in the axion field tend to suppress the back-reaction of the axion on the electrodynamics; however, we point out that the incoherent oscillations of the axion in short-lived regions of vacuum near the neutron star surface can produce a narrow radio line, which provides a complementary source of radio emission to the plasma-resonant emission processes identified in previous work. While this work focuses on the leading order correction to pair production in the magnetosphere, we speculate that there can exist dramatic deviations in the electrodynamics of these systems when the axion back-reaction becomes non-linear.</description>

Abstract: Numerical reconstruction techniques are widely employed in the calculation of multi-loop scattering amplitudes. In recent years, it has been observed that the rational functions in multi-loop calculations greatly simplify under partial fractioning. In this article, we present a technique to reconstruct rational functions directly in partial-fractioned form, by evaluating the functions at special integer points chosen for their properties under a p-adic metric. As an application, we apply this technique to reconstruct the largest rational function in the integration-by-parts reduction of one of the rank-5 integrals appearing in 2-loop 5-point full-colour massless amplitude calculations in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The number of required numerical probes (per prime field) is found to be around 25 times smaller than in conventional techniques, and the obtained result is 130 times smaller. The reconstructed result displays signs of additional structure that could be used to further reduce its size and the number of required probes.</description>

      <title>New 511 keV line data provides strongest sub-GeV dark matter constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the $511$~keV emission associated to sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles that can produce electron-positron pairs and form positronium after thermalizing. We use $\sim16$~yr of SPI data from INTEGRAL to constrain DM properties, considering the full positron propagation and losses, and the free electron density drop away from the Galactic plane. We show that the predicted longitude and latitude profiles vary significantly for different DM masses, unlike previous assumptions, and obtain the strongest limits on sub-GeV DM (from the MeV to a few GeV) so far, excluding cross-sections down to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim10^{-32}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for $m_{\chi}\sim1\,\text{MeV}$ and $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1} $ for $m_{\chi}\sim5\,\text{GeV}$ and lifetimes up to $\tau \gtrsim 10^{29}\, \textrm{s} \, (m_{\chi}\sim1\,\text{MeV}) $ and $\tau \gtrsim 10^{27}\,\textrm{s}$ ($m_{\chi}\sim5$~GeV) for the typical Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile. Our derived limits are robust within a factor of a few due to systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic nuclear reduction for tensor couplings in dark matter direct detection and $\mu \to e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonrelativistic effective field theory (NRET) is widely used in dark matter direct detection and charged-lepton flavor violation studies through $\mu \to e$ conversion. However, existing literature has not fully considered tensor couplings. This study fills this gap by utilizing an innovative tensor decomposition method, extending NRET to incorporate previously overlooked tensor interactions. This development is expected to have a significant impact on ongoing experiments seeking physics beyond the Standard Model and on our understanding of the new-physics interactions. Notably, we identify additional operators in $\mu \to e$ conversion that are absent in scalar and vector couplings. To support further research and experimental analyses, comprehensive tables featuring tensor matrix elements and their corresponding operators are provided.</description>

      <title>Wake forces in a background of quadratically coupled mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two particles can exert forces on each other when embedded in a sea of weakly-coupled particles. These "wake forces'' occur whenever the source and target particles have quadratic interactions with the mediating particles; they are proportional to the ambient energy density, and typically have a range of order the characteristic de Broglie wavelength of the background. The effect can be understood as source particles causing a disturbance in the background waves -- a wake -- which subsequently interacts with the target particles. Wake forces can be mediated by bosons or fermions, can have spin dependence, may be attractive or repulsive, and have a generally anisotropic spatial profile and range that depends on the phase-space distribution of the ambient particles. In this work, I investigate the application of wake forces to dark matter searches, recast existing limits on short-range forces into leading constraints on dark matter with quadratic couplings, and sketch out potential experimental modifications to optimize sensitivity. Wake forces occur in the Standard Model: the presence of the cosmic neutrino background induces a millimeter-range force about 22 orders of magnitude weaker than gravity. Wake forces may also be relevant in condensed-matter and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Synergy between DUNE and T2HKK to probe Invisible Neutrino Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the consequence of invisible neutrino decay within the framework of two long base-line neutrino experiments: T2HKK (Tokai-to-Hyper-Kamiokande-to-Korea) and DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino experiment). Our primary objective is to bring out the aspects of CC (charged current) and NC (neutral current) measurements at DUNE in the context of invisible neutrino decay. We find that the inclusion of NC measurements with the CC measurements enhances its ability to constrain invisible neutrino decay. Further, the synergy between DUNE and T2HKK improves the constraints on invisible neutrino decay. At 3$\sigma$ C.L. (confidence level) the derived constraint is $\tau_{3}/m_{3}\geq6.21\times10^{-11}$ s/eV. Additionally, if nature prefers $\nu_{3}$ to be unstable and the decay width is $\tau_{3}/m_{3}= 2.2\times10^{-11}$ s/eV, this combination can exclude the no-decay scenario at more than 5$\sigma$ C.L. Although the CP sensitivity is not much hindered in the presence of invisible neutrino decay, the measurements of $\theta_{23}$ and the ability to resolve octant of $\theta_{23}$ is significantly influenced in these individual experiments. In the presence of invisible neutrino decay, the synergy between DUNE and T2HKK can exclude the wrong octant somewhat more effectively than either experiment alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model beyond mean field approximation, the effects of pion fluctuations on (inverse) magnetic catalysis and magnetic susceptibility are studied. The negative magnetic susceptibility at low temperature is observed when contributions from both neutral and charged pions are taken into account. In weak field approximation, it is observed that at finite temperature, the magnetic inhibition effect in the chiral limit, resulting from the difference between the transverse and longitudinal velocities of neutral pions, converts to weak magnetic catalysis when considering a non-zero current quark mass. Moreover, the magnetic catalysis is amplified by the charged pions.</description>

      <title>OmniJet-$\alpha$: The first cross-task foundation model for particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are multi-dataset and multi-task machine learning methods that once pre-trained can be fine-tuned for a large variety of downstream applications. The successful development of such general-purpose models for physics data would be a major breakthrough as they could improve the achievable physics performance while at the same time drastically reduce the required amount of training time and data.
  We report significant progress on this challenge on several fronts. First, a comprehensive set of evaluation methods is introduced to judge the quality of an encoding from physics data into a representation suitable for the autoregressive generation of particle jets with transformer architectures (the common backbone of foundation models). These measures motivate the choice of a higher-fidelity tokenization compared to previous works. Finally, we demonstrate transfer learning between an unsupervised problem (jet generation) and a classic supervised task (jet tagging) with our new OmniJet-$\alpha$ model. This is the first successful transfer between two different and actively studied classes of tasks and constitutes a major step in the building of foundation models for particle physics.</description>

Abstract: In this study, 24.5 TeV CoM energy FCC-$\mu p$ and 20.2 TeV CoM energy SPPC-$\mu p$ muon-proton colliders have been utilized to explore the anomalous $ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$ couplings corresponding to dim-8 operators through the process of $\mu^- \gamma \to Z l^{-} \to l^{-} \tilde{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l}$. A cut-based method has been applied to enhance the signal background ratio in the analysis. Coupling limits, at a 95\% Confidence Level (C.L.), under the systematic uncertainties of 0\%, 3\%, and 5\%, were obtained with luminosities of ${\cal L}_{int}=5$ and 42.8 fb$^{-1}$ for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ colliders, respectively. The limits for anomalous $C_{BB}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{\tilde{B}W}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{WW}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{BW}/\Lambda^{4}$ couplings without systematic uncertainty for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ were found as follows, respectively: [0.06845; 0.070019967] TeV-4, [-0.18662; 0.18422] TeV-4, [-0.23623; 0.23815] TeV-4, [-0.61912; 0.62072] TeV-4, and [-0.06606; 0.05050] TeV-4, [-0.15791; 0.15126] TeV-4, [-0.20663; 0.19155] TeV-4, [-0.51383; 0.52211] TeV-4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of a one-boson-exchange model, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the $\Xi_cN/\Lambda_c\Sigma/\Xi_c^{\prime}N/\Sigma_c\Lambda/\Xi_c^*N/\Sigma_c^*\Lambda/\Sigma_c\Sigma/\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$ interactions. We consider the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effects and the coupled channel effects to derive the relevant effective potentials. Our results can predict several possible charm-strange deuteron-like $\Xi_c^{(',*)}N$ hexaquarks, the $\Xi_c^{\prime}N$ molecules with $I(I^P)=0(0^+)$, $0(1^+)$, $1(1^+)$, the $\Xi_c^*N$ molecules with $0(1^+)$, $0(2^+)$, $1(2^+)$, and the coupled $\Xi_cN/\Xi_c^{\prime}N/\Xi_c^*N/\Sigma_c\Sigma/\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$ molecule with $0(1^+)$. We expect the experiments to search for our predictions of the $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}N$ bound states.</description>

      <title>Ladder top-quark condensation imprints in supercooled electroweak phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electroweak (EW) phase transition in the early Universe might be supercooled due to the presence of the classical scale invariance involving Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) sectors and the supercooling could persist down till a later epoch around which the QCD chiral phase transition is supposed to take place. Since this supercooling period keeps masslessness for all the six SM quarks, it has simply been argued that the QCD phase transition is the first order, and so is the EW one. However, not only the QCD coupling but also the top Yukawa and the Higgs quartic couplings get strong at around the QCD scale due to the renormalization group running, hence this scenario is potentially subject to a rigorous nonperturbative analysis. In this work, we employ the ladder Schwinger-Dyson (LSD) analysis based on the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism at the two-loop level in such a gauge-Higgs-Yukawa system. We show that the chiral broken QCD vacuum emerges with the nonperturbative top condensate and the lightness of all six quarks is guaranteed due to the accidental U(1) axial symmetry presented in the top-Higgs sector. We employ a quark-meson model-like description in the mean field approximation to address the impact on the EW phase transition arising due to the top quark condensation at the QCD phase transition epoch. In the model, the LSD results are encoded to constrain the model parameter space. We then observe the cosmological phase transition of the first-order type and discuss the induced gravitational wave (GW) productions. We find that in addition to the conventional GW signals sourced from an expected BSM at around or over the TeV scale, the dynamical topponium-Higgs system can yield another power spectrum sensitive to the BBO, LISA, and DECIGO, etc.</description>

      <title>The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.</description>

Abstract: We study the realization of spontaneous CP violation through moduli stabilization. In modular flavor models, the source of CP violation is the vacuum expectation values of the complex structure moduli of toroidal compact space. We demonstrate that the combined effects of Type IIB flux compactifications with modular invariant couplings between the moduli and matter fields can induce spontaneous CP violation without or with supersymmetry breaking. Furthermore, some general properties of CP and modular invariant scalar potentials are presented. It is found that certain modifications or partial breakings of modular symmetry are useful in generating spontaneous CP violation.</description>

Abstract: We present the analytic total cross section of top quark pair production in electron-positron annihilation at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). By utilizing the optical theorem, the NNLO corrections are related to the imaginary parts of three-loop self-energy Feynman diagrams, of which the master integrals are calculated with canonical differential equations. The analytic results for the NNLO corrections are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms as well as elliptic functions. We discuss the asymptotic expansions near the threshold and in the high energy limit in detail. Numerical results are provided for the total cross section of top quark pair production at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the LuxQED approach to compute the polarized photon PDF (photon pPDF). This approach expresses the pPDF in terms of the structure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$. Different models for the structure functions are employed according to the parameter space region. The resulting pPDF is approximately of the order of $x$ times the unpolarized PDF. The relative uncertainty in the photon pPDF reaches up to $50\%$ for $x \sim 10^{-3}$, decreasing to approximately $10\%$ for higher values of $x$. The computation of the photon pPDF will be essential for improving the precision of polarized calculations and will have fundamental implications for studies at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Study of $\tau^- \to \omega \pi^- \nu_\tau$ decay in resonance chiral theory with tensor sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we make a study of the $\tau^- \to \omega\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay in the framework of low-energy effective field theory. The $J^{\mathcal{P}G}$ decompositions of the quark currents and the $\omega\pi$ final state show that, besides the Standard Model vector interaction, only the non-standard tensor interaction can have a non-zero contribution to the decay. To discuss its effect, a reliable calculation of the $\omega\pi$ tensor form factors is necessary. After constructing the Lagrangian of resonance chiral theory with external tensor sources, we calculate both the vector and tensor form factors with the relevant resonance couplings determined by combining the QCD short-distance constraints, the fit to the spectral function of $\tau^- \to \omega\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay, as well as the matching between the $\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ odd-intrinsic-parity operators after integrating out the vector resonances and the $\mathcal{O}(p^6)$ operators of chiral perturbation theory. The new physics effect is then investigated in the distributions of the spectral function and the forward-backward asymmetry of $\tau^- \to \omega\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay. We find that the spectral function is dominated by the Standard Model, and the non-standard tensor contribution is negligible. However, since the forward-backward asymmetry can be only generated with a non-zero tensor interaction, the observable is quite sensitive to this kind of new physics. A future measurement of the observable at the Belle II experiment as well as at the proposed Tera-Z and STCF facilities is, therefore, strongly called for to check the existence of such a non-standard tensor interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles that are freely propagating in superposed states in curved spacetime. We first make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime to extract the corresponding Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations that describe the deviation from geodesic motion as well as the spin precession of such particles. We then discuss, in light of our results, the case of flavour neutrinos which are, by nature, a superposition of mass eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Disentangling SMEFT and UV contributions in $h\to Z\gamma$ and $h\to\gamma\gamma$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LHC searches have revealed that the Higgs boson decay to a photon pair is nearly consistent with the Standard Model (SM), whereas recently, there is evidence for the decay of the Higgs boson to a $Z$-boson and a photon. These decays are governed by the same set of Wilson-coefficients at the tree level in Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). In this study, we aim to explain this potential discrepancy between the decays $h\to \gamma \gamma$ and $h\to Z\gamma$. We conduct a model-independent analysis in SMEFT to determine the magnitude and features of the Wilson coefficients required to account for the observed distinction between the two signal strengths. Following this, we adopt a top-down approach, considering all single and two field extensions of the SM, including scalars and fermions, as candidates for new interactions. We perform the matching of these models to one loop using automated packages and compare the models' predictions regarding $h\to Z\gamma$.</description>

      <title>DarkMatters: A powerful tool for WIMPy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new software package, DarkMatters, which has been designed to facilitate the calculation of all aspects of indirect dark matter detection of WIMPs in astrophysical settings. Two primary features of this code are the improvement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of accuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP annihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern and novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a multi-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino fluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community, such as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work with a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is managed by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand and use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with a permissive MIT source code licence.</description>

      <title>X650-&gt;ZZ/WW/H125H95/A450Z -- scalar, tensor or both ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a tensor resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A450Z coud come from a scalar resonance degenerate in mass with T650.</description>

      <title>Time-integrated constraint on neutrino flux of CHIME fast radio burst sources with 10-year IceCube point-source data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous studies, the sources of IceCube cosmic neutrinos are mostly unidentified. Utilizing recently released IceCube neutrino and CHIME fast radio burst (FRB) catalogs, we examine the possibility of an association between neutrinos and CHIME/FRB catalog 1 FRBs for both the entire FRB population and individual FRBs using the unbinned maximum likelihood method. Our results do not directly support the possibility of the above-mentioned association with three weighting schemes: equal, total radio fluence, and event rate. We then attempt to constrain the diffuse muon neutrino flux upper limit from CHIME/FRB catalog 1 FRBs. After considering a completeness correction, we find the 95% diffuse muon neutrino flux upper limit at 100 TeV for all FRB sources in the universe to be $\sim 1.01\times10^{-18}\;\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, or $\sim 70.3\%$ of the 10-year diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube. Our results match the non-detection results of other studies, but we do not rule out FRBs being a significant contributor to the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</description>

      <title>Deepest sensitivity to wavelike dark photon dark matter with superconducting radio frequency cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03183v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavelike, bosonic dark matter candidates like axions and dark photons can be detected using microwave cavities known as haloscopes. Traditionally, haloscopes consist of tunable copper cavities operating in the TM$_{010}$ mode, but ohmic losses have limited their performance. In contrast, superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities can achieve quality factors of $\sim 10^{10}$, perhaps five orders of magnitude better than copper cavities, leading to more sensitive dark matter detectors. In this paper, we first derive that the scan rate of a haloscope experiment is proportional to the loaded quality factor $Q_L$, even if the cavity bandwidth is much narrower than the dark matter halo line shape. We then present a proof-of-concept search for dark photon dark matter using a nontunable ultrahigh quality SRF cavity. We exclude dark photon dark matter with kinetic mixing strengths of $\chi &gt; 1.5\times 10^{-16}$ for a dark photon mass of $m_{A^{\prime}} = 5.35\mu$eV, achieving the deepest exclusion to wavelike dark photons by almost an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Bounds on ultralight bosons from the Event Horizon Telescope observation of Sgr A$^*$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observation of Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$) by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has uncovered various unanswered questions in black hole (BH) physics. Besides, it may also probe various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. One of the most profound possibilities is the search for ultralight bosons (ULBs) using BH superradiance (SR). EHT observations imply that Sgr A$^*$ has a non-zero spin. Using this observation, we derive bounds on the mass of ULBs with purely gravitational interactions. Considering self-interacting ultralight axions, we constrain new regions in the parameter space of decay constant, for a certain spin of Sgr A$^*$. Future observations of various spinning BHs can improve the present constraints on ULBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom and matter interferometers are precise quantum sensing experiments that can probe differential forces along separated spacetime paths. Various atom and matter interferometer experiments have been proposed to study dark matter, gravitational waves, and exotic new physics. Increasingly, these experimental concepts have proposed space-based designs to maximize interrogation times and baselines. However, decoherence and phase shifts caused by astrophysical backgrounds could largely undermine or destroy the target sensitivity of the experiments. We calculate the decoherence effects induced by solar photons, the solar wind, cosmic rays, solar neutrinos and zodiacal dust on space-based atom and matter interferometers. We find that, in future space-based atom and matter interferometers, the solar wind generically produces decoherence beyond the quantum noise limit, without proper shielding. In addition, solar photons are also an important background for matter interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a relativistic Shakhov-type generalization of the Anderson-Witting relaxation time model for the Boltzmann collision integral to modify the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. This is achieved by modifying the path on which the single particle distribution function $f_{\mathbf{k}}$ approaches local equilibrium $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ by constructing an intermediate Shakhov-type distribution $f_{\mathrm{S}\mathbf{k}}$ similar to the 14-moment approximation of Israel and Stewart. We illustrate the effectiveness of this model in case of the Bjorken expansion of an ideal gas of massive particles and the damping of longitudinal waves through an ultrarelativistic ideal gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of the one-loop vacuum energy of 10 dimensional (10D) super Yang-Mills theory on magnetized tori $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times (\mathbb{T}^2)^3$ in the presence of the Abelian magnetic fluxes, including all the contributions from Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. Higher-dimensional super Yang-Mills action is known to be repackaged in terms of 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ superfield. We, however, find that such a superspace action differs from the original 10D super Yang-Mills action in the presence of magnetic fluxes. We show that the KK mass spectrum and hence the vacuum energy computed from these two actions differ from each other. In particular, we find that the UV divergence of the vacuum energy based on the original action precisely cancels independently of flux configuration whereas that based on the superspace completion does only when flux configuration preserves supersymmetry, which implies spontaneous or explicit breaking of hidden extended supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e &lt; m_\phi &lt; 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.</description>

Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute {$f_{\mathrm{PBH}}=5.66^{+58.68}_{-5.44}\times 10^{-2}$ } of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral densities encode non-perturbative information that enters the calculation of a plethora of physical observables in strongly coupled field theories. Phenomenological applications encompass aspects of standard-model hadronic physics, observable at current colliders, as well as correlation functions characterizing new physics proposals, testable in future experiments. By making use of numerical data produced in a Sp(4) lattice gauge theory with matter transforming in an admixture of fundamental and 2-index antisymmetric representations of the gauge group, we perform a systematic study to demonstrate the effectiveness of recent technological progress in the reconstruction of spectral densities. To this purpose, we write and test new software packages that use energy-smeared spectral densities to analyze the mass spectrum of mesons. We assess the effectiveness of different smearing kernels and optimize the smearing parameters to the characteristics of available lattice ensembles. We generate new ensembles for the theory in consideration, with lattices that have a longer extent in the time direction with respect to the spatial ones. We run our tests on these ensembles, obtaining new results about the spectrum of light mesons and their excitations. We make available our algorithm and software for the extraction of spectral densities, that can be applied to theories with other gauge groups, including the theory of strong interactions (QCD) governing hadronic physics in the standard model.</description>

      <title>A unitary coupled-channel three-body amplitude with pions and kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-body dynamics above threshold is required for the reliable extraction of many amplitudes and resonances from experiment and lattice QCD. The S-matrix principle of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel approaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging two-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of a three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The unequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems ("isobars") of all isospins, $I=0,\,1/2,\,1,\, 3/2, \, 2$, and it also allows for transitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\, ("\sigma"),\,f_0(980),\,\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\,("\kappa")$, and $K^*(892)$ resonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to evaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production amplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of two-color superconducting quark matter in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense,
  neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from
  weak-interaction-driven direct URCA processes. The quark matter is
  modeled using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model improved to account for
  vector and 't Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing
  among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations
  are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute
  the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and
  electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The
  resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1--10\,kHz
  range shows a resonant peak at $T\sim 5\,\MeV$, and the damping time
  may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to affect the
  postmerger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted
  in nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Premerger phenomena in neutron-star binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>The Dark Dimension and the Grand Unification of Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, predicting one extra mesoscopic dimension in the micron range, has emerged by applying various Swampland principles to the dark energy. In this note we find that realizing the grand unification of gauge forces is highly constraining in this context. Without actually constructing any GUT models, we argue that the mere assumption of grand unification of forces in this scenario, together with the experimental bounds on massive replicas of the Standard Model gauge bosons, predicts an upper bound for the GUT scale, $M_{GUT}\lesssim 10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. Combined with the experimental bound on the proton lifetime, this predicts that the $X$ gauge boson mediating proton decay is a 5d solitonic string of Planckian tension stretched across a length scale $L\sim ({\rm 1-10\ TeV})^{-1}$ ending on gauge branes of the same diameter $\sim L$. This leads to a mass of $M_X\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. In particular assuming grand unification in the dark dimension scenario results in a tower of Kaluza-Klein excitations of Standard Model gauge bosons on the gauge branes in the 1-10 TeV range. This suggests that the diameter/separation $L$ of the gauge branes correlates with both the weak scale $\sim 1/L$ near a TeV {\it and} the GUT scale $\sim M_5^2 L$ at $10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$.</description>
