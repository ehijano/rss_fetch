      <title>Architected Structural Material Design Inspired by Diatoms: Merging Nature's Beauty With Engineering Through Biomimetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine a world where beauty and technology move in perfect harmony, revealing tiny masterpieces hidden in the water. This world is Nature, and diatoms are the stars. Masters of assembling complex hierarchical glass structures, these microscopic algae are true technological gems, and their potential is boundless when it comes to transforming our world. From pharmaceutical applications to biomaterial synthesis, water purification to advanced optical systems, solar cells to the production of new fuels, architecture to design objects, diatoms teach us that Nature's potential is limitless, proving to be invaluable allies for innovation and sustainable development. But how can organisms so small hold such immense potential? In this chapter, we will explore the key characteristics of diatoms and unveil the hidden secrets behind their beauty and multifunctionality, offering an interdisciplinary vision that celebrates the interaction between art and science. We provide concrete examples of structural materials that demonstrate how diatoms can serve as the meeting point between artistic creativity and technological innovation, inspiring new design paradigms and reshaping how we approach materials science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Elastic overtones: an equal temperament 12 tone music system with "perfect" fifths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impossibility of a transposable 12 semitone tuning of the octave arises from the mathematical fact that $2 \times 2^{7/12} \neq 3$ i.e., the second harmonic of the fifth can not exactly match the third harmonic of the fundamental. This in turn, stems from the whole number harmonic structure of western music, and the subsequent fundamental character of the octave interval as multiples of 2 in frequency, a property inherited by our music system from the physics of instruments with vibrating elements being to a good approximation one dimensional. In the current era of electronic music, one can relax the above assumptions to construct an analogous music system where all the structural properties of the standard music system are preserved, but where harmonics are not whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, and the octave is no longer a factor of 2 in frequency. This now allows to construct a transposable 12 semitone music system where the second harmonic of the fifth exactly matches the third harmonic of the fundamental. The enhanced harmonic qualities of this system recover to a good approximation the musical qualities of Just Intonation, whilst retaining by construction all the versatility and modulating ability of 12TET.</description>
