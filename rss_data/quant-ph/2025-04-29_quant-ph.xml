      <title>Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature does not accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically better at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last two decades has seen quantum thermodynamics become a well established field of research in its own right. In that time, it has demonstrated a remarkably broad applicability, ranging from providing foundational advances in the understanding of how thermodynamic principles apply at the nano-scale and in the presence of quantum coherence, to providing a guiding framework for the development of efficient quantum devices. Exquisite levels of control have allowed state-of-the-art experimental platforms to explore energetics and thermodynamics at the smallest scales which has in turn helped to drive theoretical advances. This Roadmap provides an overview of the recent developments across many of the field's sub-disciplines, assessing the key challenges and future prospects, providing a guide for its near term progress.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pulse Design in Floquet Engineering: Application to Interacting Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of a NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational-invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a transition between different knot structures. We emphasize that the choice of a NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Morse Oscillator in the Presence of Dissipationless Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The much-studied Morse oscillator (MO) is couched here in the context of an open quantum system, in which the interaction with the quantum environment, however, is taken to commute with the subsystem Hamiltonian. The result is decoherence sans dissipation because of dephasing in the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density operator. The analytical results are numerically computed for a range of parameters, for different attributes of decoherence. Finally, comparison is made for the corresponding harmonic system, in order to highlight the significance of anharmonicity in the MO, as far as dependencies on the temperature and the environmental coupling are concerned.</description>

      <title>Network-Aware Scheduling for Remote Gate Execution in Quantum Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular quantum computing provides a scalable approach to overcome the limitations of monolithic quantum architectures by interconnecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) through a quantum network. In this work, we explore and evaluate two entanglement scheduling strategies-static and dynamic-and analyze their performance in terms of circuit execution delay and network resource utilization under realistic assumptions and practical limitations such as probabilistic entanglement generation, limited communication qubits, photonic switch reconfiguration delays, and topology-induced contention. We show that dynamic scheduling consistently outperforms static scheduling in scenarios with high entanglement parallelism, especially when network resources are scarce. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of communication qubit coherence time, modeled as a cutoff for holding EPR pairs, and demonstrate that aggressive lookahead strategies can degrade performance when coherence times are short, due to premature entanglement discarding and wasted resources. We also identify congestion-free BSM provisioning by profiling peak BSM usage per switch. Our results provide actionable insights for scheduler design and resource provisioning in realistic quantum data centers, bringing system-level considerations closer to practical quantum computing deployment.</description>

      <title>Parameter optimization for the unimon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductively shunted superconducting qubits, such as the unimon qubit, combine high anharmonicity with protection from low-frequency charge noise, positioning them as promising candidates for the implementation of fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers. In this work, we develop accurate closed-form approximations for the frequency and anharmonicity of the unimon qubit that are also applicable to any single-mode superconducting qubits with a single-well potential profile, such as the quarton qubit or the kinemon qubit. We use these results to theoretically explore the single-qubit gate fidelity and coherence times across the parameter space of qubits with a single-well potential. We find that the gate fidelity can be optimized by tuning the Hamiltonian to $(i)$ a high qubit mode impedance of $1-2$ $k\Omega$, $(ii)$ a low qubit frequency of $1$ $GHz$, $(iii)$ and a perfect cancellation of the linear inductance and the Josephson inductance attained at a flux bias of half flux quantum. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed qubit parameters have potential to enhance the single-qubit gate fidelity of the unimon beyond $99.99\%$ even without significant improvements to the dielectric quality factor or the flux noise density measured for the first unimon qubits. Furthermore, we compare unimon, transmon and fluxonium qubits in terms of their energy spectra and qubit coherence subject to dielectric loss and $1/f$ flux noise in order to highlight the advantages and limitations of each qubit type.</description>

      <title>The $2$ -- D free particle in the phase space quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner function of a free quantum particle propagating on a plane is derived.
  Two options are discussed. First the particle with fixed components of the momentum is mentioned. Then the particle of given energy and angular momentum is considered. The analysis does not refer to the Hilbert space formulation of the problem at all. One starts from
  a choice of coordinates on the symplectic space $(\mathbb{R}^{4},\,\omega)$ suitable for representation of eigenstates of the discussed particle. Then the Moyal $\star_{(\text{M})}$ -- product on the phase space is derived with the use of the Fedosov algorithm adapted to curvilinear coordinates on a flat phase space. Next the eigenvalue equations for the Wigner eigenfunction are solved. Finally the physically acceptable solutions are identified.</description>

      <title>Estimating decoding graphs and hypergraphs of memory QEC experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the error sources of quantum devices is essential for building reliable large-scale quantum architectures and tailoring error correction codes to the noise profile of the devices. Tomography techniques can provide detailed information on the noise or quality of quantum states but are typically both computationally and experimentally intensive with respect to the system's size. For QEC experiments, however, the information captured by a detector error model is sufficient for extracting the success rate of the experiment, as well as some information about the underlying noise. In this work, we estimate Pauli noise on detector error models, including hypergraphs, using only the syndrome statistics. We apply this method to well-known codes such as the repetition, surface, and 2D color codes. Under bare-ancilla syndrome extraction, two-point correlations are enough to reconstruct the detector error model for repetition or surface codes. For color codes or repetition codes under Steane-style syndrome extraction, we show how to extend the estimation method to multi-point correlators and extract the error rates of the hypergraphs. Finally, we find an increase in logical error suppression when we calibrate the decoder to noise fluctuations typically present in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we consider properly defined two-parameter Wigner functions that, e.g., can be used as witness for quantum behaviour for pure states as expressed in terms of a self-adjoint observable angular position and the corresponding angular momentum operator L. It is shown that negative values of the corresponding Wigner functions may reveal the quantum nature of superpositions of angular momentum eigenstates with a fractional mean value of L but in an ambiguous manner. For a suitable choice of parameters these Wigner functions are positive and are in accordance with Borns rule in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Saturation of Quantum Cramer-Rao Bounds for Distributed Sensing via Error Sensitivity in SU(1,1)-SU(m) Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the standard quantum limit in the sensing of parameters at different spatial locations, such as in a quantum network, is of great importance. Using the framework of quantum Fisher information, many strategies based on squeezed quantum probes and multipath multiphoton or multiqubit entangled states have been considered. In this context there is always the question of what is the simplest measurement that would saturate quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB). The simplest quantity to measure would be characteristics of photon flux or population distribution in case of qubits. Previous studies have shown that the error sensitivity in SU(1,1) interferometry, also known by several other names as nonlinear interferometry, time reversed measurements; does saturate QCRB for single parameters like phase, displacement, loss. In this work we bring out great utility of generalized SU(1,1) interferometry in distributed sensing. The generalized SU(1,1) interferometry is a combination of SU(m) and SU(1,1) elements, where m is the number of nodes in the network. The SU(m) element is used to produce distributed entanglement starting from a squeezed photonic or matter probe. We demonstrate how error sensitivity measurement at just one output port can saturate or nearly saturate QCRB and thus results in Heisenberg sensitivity of network sensing.</description>

      <title>Superradiance in dense atomic samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</description>

      <title>Multimode Entangled Squeezed Light Generation and Propagation in a Coupled-Cavity Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate method for modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems. We apply our approach to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal coupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light on-chip. The system consists of a three-mode, three-defect resonant structure coupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square lattice silicon photonic crystal slab. We model the system using a basis of 184 non-orthogonal lossy quasi-modes. A two-mode squeezed thermal state of light is generated via degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing in the resonant structure, which is pumped with a Gaussian pulse via a pump-CROW. The generated entangled signal and idler pulses of light are coupled out of the resonant structure into the two output-CROWs. Due to careful design of the resonant structure and the CROWs, the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs remains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs. Our approach is general and computationally efficient and thus can be applied to modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in a wide variety of coupled-cavity photonic structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gate Decomposition: A Study of Compilation Time vs. Execution Time Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to classical programming, high-level quantum programming languages generate code that cannot be executed directly by quantum hardware and must be compiled. However, unlike classical code, quantum programs must be compiled before each execution, making the trade-off between compilation time and execution time particularly significant. In this paper, we address the first step of quantum compilation: multi-qubit gate decomposition. We analyze the trade-offs of state-of-the-art decomposition algorithms by implementing them in the Ket quantum programming platform and collecting numerical performance data. This is the first study to both implement and analyze the current state-of-the-art decomposition methods within a single platform. Based on our findings, we propose two compilation profiles: one optimized for minimizing compilation time and another for minimizing quantum execution time. Our results provide valuable insights for both quantum compiler developers and quantum programmers, helping them make informed decisions about gate decomposition strategies and their impact on overall performance.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider the inverse problem of determining the properties of a Wigner function from the set of its zeros (the nodal set). The previous state of the art of the problem is Hudson's theorem, which shows that an empty nodal set is associated only with generalized Gaussians. We extend this analysis to non-Gaussian functions. Our first main result states that, if the nodal set of the Wigner distribution of a function $f$ is bounded, then $f$ is equal to a generalized Gaussian times a polynomial. An immediate consequence of this result is that any open set is a uniqueness set for Wigner functions with bounded nodal set. Our second main result shows that the only Wigner function vanishing on a circle of radius $\sqrt{\hbar/2}$ and centered at the origin is the Wigner distribution of the first Hermite function. We prove similar results for the second and third Hermite functions. We also derive for Wigner functions a counterpart of the sign uncertainty principle of J. Bourgain, L. Clozel and J.-P. Kahane, which says that if the negative part of a Wigner function is contained in a ball, then the radius of the ball has a lower bound. Finally, we obtain various constraints on Wigner distributions whose bounded nodal sets contain circles, ellipses or line segments. As a by-product of our work we prove several non-trivial results about the zeros of Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Coherent State Assisted Entanglement Generation Between Quantum Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating entanglement deterministically at a capacity-approaching rate is critical for next-generation quantum networks. We propose weak-coherent-state-assisted protocols that can generate entanglement near-deterministically between reflective-cavity-based quantum memories at a success rate that exceeds the 50\% limit associated with single-photon-mediated schemes. The most pronounced benefit is shown in the low-channel-loss regime and persists even with moderate noise. We extend our protocols to entangle an array of memories in a GHZ state, and infer that it yields an exponential speed-up compared to previous single-photon-based protocols.</description>

      <title>The Problem of No Return Photon Ranging Measurements with Entangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fascinating problem of light detection and ranging measurement without necessitating the return of the photon directed towards the target or object. We approach this challenging problem using quantum entanglement - an entangled pair of photons; one photon is sent toward the target or object, while the other is directed into a medium, which undergoes continuous measurements. We assume the light-matter interaction at the target such that the quantum state collapse is probabilistically biased. We present thought experiments and measurement schemes to conduct correlation measurements and examine the methodology of these measurements to estimate the target's range, using a maximally entangled Bell state ($|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|H_1V_2\rangle + |V_1H_2\rangle)$) as an example. When the photon interacts with the target, the Bell state undergoes biased decoherence or state collapse, leaving a signature in the spatial correlation G(x) quantity.</description>

      <title>Noise limits for dc SQUID readout of high-$Q$ resonators below 300 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the limits on noise for the readout of cryogenic high-$Q$ resonators using dc Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) below 300 MHz. This analysis uses realized first-stage SQUIDs (previously published), whose performance is well described by Tesche-Clarke (TC) theory, coupled directly to the resonators. We also present data from a prototype second-stage dc SQUID array designed to couple to this first-stage SQUID as a follow-on amplifier with high system bandwidth. This analysis is the first full consideration of dc SQUID noise performance referred to a high-$Q$ resonator over this frequency range, and is presented relative to the standard quantum limit. We include imprecision, backaction, and backaction-imprecision noise correlations from TC theory, the noise contributed by the second-stage SQUIDs, wiring, and preamplifiers, and optimizations for both on-resonance measurements and off-resonance scan sensitivity. This architecture has modern relevance due to the increased interest in axion searches and the requirements of the DMRadio-m$^3$ axion search, which will use dc SQUIDs in this frequency range.</description>

      <title>Petz recovery maps of single-qubit decoherence channels in an ion trap quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Petz recovery map provides a near-optimal reversal of quantum noise, yet proposals for its implementation are only recent. We propose a physical realization of the exact state-specific Petz map in an ion trap for qubit decoherence channels. Our circuit constructions require at most $1 (2)$ ancilla qubits and $3 (20)$ CNOT gates for channels with Kraus rank $2 (&gt;2)$. We analyze typical ion trap errors and construct corresponding Petz maps, simulating their performance under realistic noise modeled by residual spin-motion coupling. Quantum circuits are provided for depolarizing, dephasing, and amplitude damping channels. Focusing on single-shot recovery, suited for present-day devices, we also quantify the precision of prior knowledge required to achieve a recovery error below 0.01 across varying decoherence levels and state purities.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a flowchart-based description of the decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol and provide a step-by-step, self-contained information-theoretic security proof for this protocol within the universal composable security framework. As a result, our proof yields a key rate consistent with previous findings. Importantly, unlike all the prior security proofs, our approach offers a fully rigorous and mathematical justification for achieving the key rate with the claimed correctness and secrecy parameters, thereby representing a significant step toward the formal certification of QKD systems.</description>

      <title>A Family of Self-Dual Quasicrystals with Critical Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.</description>

      <title>Initialization of Neutral and Charged Exciton Spin States in a Telecom-Emitting Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}&gt;6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for the Floquet-Magnus expansion and their application to the semiclassical quantum Rabi model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general, nonperturbative method for deriving effective Hamiltonians of arbitrary order for periodically driven systems, based on an iterated integration by parts technique. The resulting family of effective Hamiltonians reproduces the well-known Floquet-Magnus expansion, now enhanced with explicit error bounds that quantify the distance between the exact and approximate dynamics at each order, even in cases where the Floquet-Magnus series fails to converge. We apply the method to the semiclassical Rabi model and provide explicit error bounds for both the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian and its third-order refinement. Our analysis shows that, while the rotating-wave approximation more accurately captures the true dynamics than the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian in most regimes, the third-order approximation ultimately outperforms both.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Evolution of Near-Field Photonic Qubits into High-Dimensional Qudits via State Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nanophotonics offers essential tools and technologies for controlling quantum states, while maintaining a miniature form factor and high scalability. For example, nanophotonic platforms can transfer information from the traditional degrees of freedom (DoFs), such as spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), to the DoFs of the nanophotonic platform - and back, opening new directions for quantum information processing. Recent experiments have utilized the total angular momentum (TAM) of a photon as a unique means to produce entangled qubits in nanophotonic platforms. Yet, the process of transferring the information between the free-space DoFs and the TAM was never investigated, and its implications are still unknown. Here, we reveal the evolution of quantum information in heralded single photons as they couple into and out of the near-field of a nanophotonic system. Through quantum state tomography, we discover that the TAM qubit in the near-field becomes a free-space qudit entangled in the photonic SAM and OAM. The extracted density matrix and Wigner function in free-space indicate state preparation fidelity above 97%. The concepts described here bring new concepts and methodologies in developing high-dimensional quantum circuitry on a chip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining two disparate lines of thought like thermodynamics and quantum mechanics yields surprising results. The resulting idea of quantum thermodynamic engines holds promise for harvesting novel sources of energy of purely quantum origin, like quantum statistics, to extract mechanical work from macroscopic quantum systems like Bose-Einstein condensates. It also allows one to explore thermodynamic thinking to `small' systems consisting only a few particles in quantum theory. In an earlier paper we had studied the quantum Otto engine using a small number of one-dimensional anyons as the medium to drive the thermodynamic engine. In this sequel, we study the gold-standard of thermodynamic engines, namely the Carnot engine, using two-dimensional anyons as the medium. An explicit expression is derived for the efficiency of the anyonic quantum Carnot engine.</description>

      <title>How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than carefully surveying the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we extract an orthodoxy empirically. To do this we review a collection of 33 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy is largely unchanged over the past century, with some interesting emerging deviations, and has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints. However, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense it down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two main pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles. More fully it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently changes its state in a random fashion, manifesting in a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for processing data in short-time batches are critical for both online and offline processing of streamed and large data respectively due to the quadratic relation between signal length and computational cost of convolution-based processing schemes. Whilst quantum analogs to some digital signal processing algorithms have been discovered, including the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), there has been no development of short-time processing techniques in the quantum domain. In this manuscript, we introduce the short-time QFT (STQFT) processing technique to bridge this gap in research. We develop a novel overlap-add reconstruction technique in the quantum domain using a permutation gate to combine subsequent windows. With this in mind, we discuss convolution under our novel STQFT processing scheme. We demonstrate filtering in the quantum Fourier domain with a filter stored in a quantum register as well as in a block encoded unitary gate. Throughout the paper, we elaborate upon implementation details such as applying DC offsets to input signals, skipping input data frames whenever necessary, the use of overlap-save as a reconstruction technique and mitigating time-varying scaling due to normalization of the windowed input data and filters.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Tomographic Image Refinement with Limited Qubits for High-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-assisted reconstruction framework for high-resolution tomographic imaging that significantly reduces both qubit requirements and radiation exposure. Conventional quantum reconstruction methods require solving QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problems over full-resolution image grids, which limits scalability under current hardware constraints. Our method addresses this by combining sinogram downscaling with region-wise iterative refinement, allowing reconstruction to begin from a reduced-resolution sinogram and image, then progressively upscaled and optimized region by region. Experimental validation on binary and integer-valued Shepp-Logan phantoms demonstrates accurate reconstructions under both dense and sparsely sampled projection conditions using significantly fewer qubits. We observed that nearest-neighbor interpolation may cause edge artifacts that hinder convergence, which can be mitigated by smoother interpolation and Gaussian filtering. Notably, reconstructing a 500 by 500 image from a 50 by 50 initialization demonstrates the potential for up to 90% reduction in projection data, corresponding to a similar reduction in radiation dose. These findings highlight the practicality and scalability of the proposed method for quantum-enhanced tomographic reconstruction, offering a promising direction for low-dose, high-fidelity imaging with current-generation quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Avoided-crossings, degeneracies and Berry phases in the spectrum of quantum noise through analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bloch-Messiah decomposition (BMD) is a fundamental tool in quantum optics, enabling the analysis and tailoring of multimode Gaussian states by decomposing linear optical transformations into passive interferometers and single-mode squeezers. Its extension to frequency-dependent matrix-valued functions, recently introduced as the ``analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition" (ABMD), provides the most general approach for characterizing the driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum optical systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians. In this work, we present a detailed study of the ABMD, focusing on the typical behavior of parameter-dependent singular values and of their corresponding singular vectors. In particular, we analyze the hitherto unexplored occurrence of avoided and genuine crossings in the spectrum of quantum noise, the latter being manifested by nontrivial topological Berry phases of the singular vectors. We demonstrate that avoided crossings arise naturally when a single parameter is varied, leading to hypersensitivity of the singular vectors and suggesting the presence of genuine crossings in nearby systems. We highlight the possibility of programming the spectral response of photonic systems through the deliberate design of avoided crossings. As a notable example, we show that such control can be exploited to generate broad, flat-band squeezing spectra -- a desirable feature for enhancing degaussification protocols. This study provides new insights into the structure of multimode quantum correlations and offers a theoretical framework for experimental exploitation of complex quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\Delta \in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Limits of absolute vector magnetometry with NV centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform for quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically allow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down to $\mathrm{fT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.</description>

      <title>A multireference picture of electronic excited states in vanadyl and copper tetraphenyl porphyrin molecular qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of electronic excited states has a deep impact on the dynamics of molecular spins, but remains poorly understood and characterized. Here we carry out a thorough multiconfigurational investigation for two prototypical molecular qubits based on vanadyl and copper tetra-phenyl porphyrins. State-average CASSCF and NEVPT2 calculations have been employed with four different active spaces of growing complexity to account for the d-d, second d-shell, ligand-to-metal charge transfer states and $\pi-\pi^*$ excited states, revealing an in-depth picture of low-lying excited states in agreement with experimental observations. The largest active spaces attempted, (13,14) for the vanadyl and (17,12) for the copper compounds, reveal that the lowest-lying excited states originate from $\pi-\pi^*$ quartet excitations. These findings shed light on the nature of the excited states of molecular qubits, taking an important step toward elucidating their role in molecular spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>The role of dark polariton states for electronic strong coupling in molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry investigates the possible modification of chemical and photochemical reactions by means of strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities, as demonstrated in numerous experiments over the last few years. These experiments are typically interpreted in terms of the Jaynes-Cummings or Tavis-Cummings models under the assumption that the molecular ensemble is only excited by a single photon. In such a model, two polariton states compete with an overwhelming number of dark states, inhibiting polaritonic reactions entropically. We analyze the higher excitation manifolds of the Tavis-Cummings model along with a three-level system that resembles photochemical reactions. We demonstrate that allowing for more than a single excitation makes the reaction of the involved polaritons entropically more favorable.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Range-Doppler Algorithm for Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a well established technology in the field of Earth remote sensing. Over the years, the resolution of SAR images has been steadily improving and the pixel count increasing as a result of advances in the sensor technology, and so have the computational resources required to process the raw data to a focused image. Because they are a necessary step in the study of the retrieved data, new high-resolution and low-complexity focusing algorithms are constantly explored in the SAR literature. The theory of quantum computing proposes a new computational framework that might allow to process a vast amount of data in a more efficient way. Relevant to our case is the advantage proven for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), the quantum counterpart of a fundamental element of many SAR focusing algorithms. Motivated by this, in this work we propose a quantum version of the range-Doppler algorithm. We show how in general reference functions, a key element in many SAR focusing algorithms, can be mapped to quantum gates; we present the quantum circuit performing the SAR raw data focusing and we discuss in detail its computational complexity. We find that the core of the quantum range-Doppler algorithm has a computational complexity, namely the number of single- and two-qubit gates, of $O(N)$, less than its classical counterpart with computational complexity $O(N \log N)$.</description>

      <title>The Contextual Heisenberg Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heisenberg microscope provides a powerful mental image of the measurement process of quantum mechanics (QM), attempting to explain the uncertainty relation through an uncontrollable back-action from the measurement device. However, Heisenberg's proposed back-action uses features that are not present in the QM description of the world, and according to Bohr not present in the world. Therefore, Bohr argues, the mental image proposed by Heisenberg should be avoided. Later developments by Bell and Kochen-Specker shows that a model that contains the features used for the Heisenberg microscope is in principle possible but must necessarily be nonlocal and contextual. In this paper we will re-examine the measurement process within a restriction of QM known as Stabilizer QM, that still exhibits for example Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger nonlocality and Peres-Mermin contextuality. The re-examination will use a recent extension of stabilizer QM, the Contextual Ontological Model (COM), where the system state gives a complete description of future measurement outcomes reproducing the quantum predictions, including the mentioned phenomena. We will see that the resulting contextual Heisenberg microscope back-action can be completely described within COM, and that the associated randomness originates in the initial state of the pointer system, exactly as in the original description of the Heisenberg microscope. The presence of contextuality, usually seen as prohibiting ontological models, suggests that the contextual Heisenberg microscope picture can be enabled in general QM.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of the Interacting Schwinger Model on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations in high-energy physics are currently emerging as an application of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we explore the multi-flavor lattice Schwinger model - a toy model inspired by quantum chromodynamics - in one spatial dimension and with nonzero chemical potential by means of variational quantum simulation on a shuttling-based trapped-ion quantum processor. This fermionic problem becomes intractable for classical numerical methods even for small system sizes due to the notorious sign problem. We employ a parametric quantum circuit executed on our quantum processor to identify ground states in different parameter regimes of the model, mapping out a quantum phase transition which is the hallmark feature of the model. The resulting states are analyzed via quantum state tomography, to reveal how characteristic properties such as correlations in the output state change across the phase transition. Moreover, we use the results to determine the phase boundaries of the model.</description>

      <title>Field energy and angular momentum in spontaneous emission: A Schr\"odinger-picture approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger-picture approach is used to calculate the field energy and angular momentum radiated by an atom undergoing spontaneous emission. The calculation is carried out using both the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). It is shown that a consistent application of the WWA leads to expressions for both the energy and angular momentum in the field that are finite for all times, in contrast to the results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Moreover, it is shown that the total angular momentum in the field is a sum of its spin and orbital components, again in contrast to the analogous results for a classical point dipole oscillator. Analytic expressions for the energy, spin angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum in the field are obtained for an atom undergoing spontaneous emission from a state having angular momentum H to a state having angular momentum G via an electric dipole transition. It is shown that the spin and orbital angular momenta in the field are equal, independent of the values of H and G. With a slight modification of the WWA, it can also be shown that the energy density in the field, the Poynting vector of the field, and the angular momentum flux of the field do not diverge at the origin.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform in Logarithmic Depth on a Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximate quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) on $n$ qubits can be implemented in logarithmic depth using $8n$ qubits with all-to-all connectivity, as shown in [Hales, PhD Thesis Berkeley, 2002]. However, realizing the required all-to-all connectivity can be challenging in practice. In this work, we use dynamic circuits, i.e., mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward operations, to implement the AQFT in logarithmic depth using only $4n$ qubits arranged on a line with nearest-neighbor connectivity. Furthermore, for states with a specific structure, the number of qubits can be further reduced to $2n$ while keeping the logarithmic depth and line connectivity. As part of our construction, we introduce a new implementation of an adder with logarithmic depth on a line, which allows us to improve the AQFT construction of Hales.</description>

      <title>Language Model for Large-Text Transmission in Noisy Quantum Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication has the potential to revolutionize information processing, providing unparalleled security and increased capacity compared to its classical counterpart by using the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the presence of noise remains a major barrier to realizing these advantages. While strategies like quantum error correction and mitigation have been developed to address this challenge, they often come with substantial overhead in physical qubits or sample complexity, limiting their practicality for large-scale information transfer. Here, we present an alternative approach: applying machine learning frameworks from natural language processing to enhance the performance of noisy quantum communications, focusing on superdense coding. By employing bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), a model known for its capabilities in natural language processing, we demonstrate improvements in information transfer efficiency without resorting to conventional error correction or mitigation techniques. These results mark a step toward the practical realization of a scalable and resilient quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Transversal Gates in Nonadditive Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transversal gates play a crucial role in suppressing error propagation in fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet they are intrinsically constrained: any nontrivial code encoding a single logical qubit admits only a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ as its transversal operations. We introduce a systematic framework for searching codes with specified transversal groups by parametrizing their logical subspaces on the Stiefel manifold and minimizing a composite loss that enforces both the Knill-Laflamme conditions and a target transversal-group structure. Applying this method, we uncover a new $((6,2,3))$ code admitting a transversal $Z\bigl(\tfrac{2\pi}{5}\bigr)$ gate (transversal group $\mathrm{C}_{10}$), the smallest known distance $3$ code supporting non-Clifford transversal gates, as well as several new $((7,2,3))$ codes realizing the binary icosahedral group $2I$. We further propose the \emph{Subset-Sum-Linear-Programming} (SS-LP) construction for codes with transversal \emph{diagonal} gates, which dramatically shrinks the search space by reducing to integer partitions subject to linear constraints. In a more constrained form, the method also applies directly to the binary-dihedral groups $\mathrm{BD}_{2m}$. Specializing to $n=7$, the SS-LP method yields codes for all $\mathrm{BD}_{2m}$ with $2m\le 36$, including the first $((7,2,3))$ examples supporting transversal $T$ gate ($\mathrm{BD}_{16}$) and $\sqrt{T}$ gate ($\mathrm{BD}_{32}$), improving on the previous smallest examples $((11,2,3))$ and $((19,2,3))$. Extending the SS-LP approach to $((8,2,3))$, we construct new codes for $2m&gt;36$, including one supporting a transversal $T^{1/4}$ gate ($\mathrm{BD}_{64}$). These results reveal a far richer landscape of nonadditive codes than previously recognized and underscore a deeper connection between quantum error correction and the algebraic constraints on transversal gate groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the bosonic compound wiretap channel. A pair of lossy channels connects a sender with both a (legitimate) receiver and an eavesdropper. The sender and receiver have only partial information about the actual state of the channels. In this situation, their task is to transmit the maximum amount of messages over an asymptotically large number of uses of their channel while guaranteeing at the same time that only an (asymptotically) negligible amount of information leaks to the eavesdropper. We prove capacity formulas for the case where both sender and receiver have the same information about the system and for the case where the sender has channel state information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems that interact non-locally with an environment (or bath) serve as paradigms for exploring collective phenomena. These systems naturally arise in physical setups featuring long-range many-body interactions, and are experimentally realized in platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays, cold atoms in optical cavities, ion traps, and dipolar systems. They hold broad potential for applications in quantum computing and quantum sensing. In this work, we reveal an exact theoretical mechanism governing such non-locally and mesoscopically coupled systems. We demonstrate that the effect of general environments on the system exhibits a universal bosonic character. Specifically, the exact effect that environments have on the system, regardless of their microscopic details, is equivalently produced by the interaction with a reservoir of non-interacting bosonic modes. The emergent 'bosonization' of the environment results from the mesoscopic coupling in the thermodynamic limit and can be interpreted as a manifestation of the central limit theorem. While this effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha&gt;D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\'y and Preiss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's seminal work showed that no local hidden variable (LHV) model can fully reproduce the quantum correlations of a two-qubit singlet state. His argument and later developments by Clauser et al. effectively rely on gaps between the anticorrelations achievable by classical models and quantum theory for projective measurements along randomly chosen axes separated by a fixed angle. However, the size of these gaps has to date remained unknown. Here we numerically determine the LHV models maximizing anticorrelations for random axes separated by any fixed angle, by mapping the problem onto ground state configurations of fixed-range spin models. We identify angles where this gap is largest and thus best suited for Bell tests. These findings enrich the understanding of Bell non-locality as a physical resource in quantum information theory and quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization of Passive Unitary Normalizable (PUN) Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of the class of multimode quantum Gaussian states that can be reduced to a tensor product of thermal states using only a passive unitary operator. We call these states \textit{passive unitary normalizable} (PUN) Gaussian states. The characterization of PUN Gaussian states is given in three different ways: $(i)$ in terms of their covariance matrices, $(ii)$ using gauge-invariance (a special class of Glauber--Sudarshan $p$-functions), and $(iii)$ with respect to the recently obtained $(A,\Lambda)$ parametrization of Gaussian states in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 022102 (2021)]. In terms of the covariance matrix, our characterization states that an $n$-mode quantum Gaussian state is PUN if and only if its $2n\times 2n$ quantum covariance matrix $S$ commutes with the standard symplectic matrix $J$. It is well-known that the so-called gauge-invariant Gaussian states are PUN, but whether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We establish the converse in affirmation. Lastly, in terms of the $(A,\Lambda)$-parameterization, we show that a Gaussian state with parameters $(A,\Lambda)$ is PUN if and only if $A=0$.</description>

      <title>Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms for k-means clustering via uniform sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [$q$-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning; Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We prove worse-case guarantees that significantly improve upon the bounds for previous algorithms. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.</description>

      <title>Localized Fock Space Cages in Kinetically Constrained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism for non-ergodic behavior in many-body quantum systems arising from destructive interference, leading to localization in Fock space. Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Photonic Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks with Adaptive State Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear optical architectures have been extensively investigated for quantum computing and quantum machine learning applications. Recently, proposals for photonic quantum machine learning have combined linear optics with resource adaptivity, such as adaptive circuit reconfiguration, which promises to enhance expressivity and improve algorithm performances and scalability. Moreover, linear optical platforms preserve some subspaces due to the fixed number of particles during the computation, a property recently exploited to design a novel quantum convolutional neural networks. This last architecture has shown an advantage in terms of running time complexity and of the number of parameters needed with respect to other quantum neural network proposals. In this work, we design and experimentally implement the first photonic quantum convolutional neural network (PQCNN) architecture based on particle-number preserving circuits equipped with state injection, an approach recently proposed to increase the controllability of linear optical circuits. Subsequently, we experimentally validate the PQCNN for a binary image classification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum dot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic interferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. In order to investigate the scalability of the PQCNN design, we have performed numerical simulations on datasets of different sizes. We highlight the potential utility of a simple adaptive technique for a nonlinear Boson Sampling task, compatible with near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Dani-Mainkar construction, we extend the notion of independence polynomial of graphs to arbitrary 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras. After establishing efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for the independence number, we discuss a metric-dependent generalization motivated by a quantum mechanical interpretation of our construction. As an application, we derive elementary bounds for the dimension of abelian subalgebras of 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the physical system governed by a Hamiltonian operator, in two-dimensional space, of spinless charged particles subject to a perpendicular magnetic field B, coupled with a harmonic potential in the context of nonextensive statistical thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of such a quantum gas system is elaborated in the framework of Tsallis statistics by obtaining the q versions of the partition function, magnetization, and susceptibility after performing the Hilhorst integral transformation. The results are discussed in the q $\mapsto$ 1 limit.</description>

      <title>Long-Distance Field Demonstration of Imaging-Free Drone Identification in Intracity Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting small objects, such as drones, over long distances presents a significant challenge with broad implications for security, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems. Traditional imaging-based methods rely on high-resolution image acquisition, but are often constrained by range, power consumption, and cost. In contrast, data-driven single-photon-single-pixel light detection and ranging (\text{D\textsuperscript{2}SP\textsuperscript{2}-LiDAR}) provides an imaging-free alternative, directly enabling target identification while reducing system complexity and cost. However, its detection range has been limited to a few hundred meters. Here, we introduce a novel integration of residual neural networks (ResNet) with \text{D\textsuperscript{2}SP\textsuperscript{2}-LiDAR}, incorporating a refined observation model to extend the detection range to 5~\si{\kilo\meter} in an intracity environment while enabling high-accuracy identification of drone poses and types. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms conventional imaging-based recognition systems, but also achieves 94.93\% pose identification accuracy and 97.99\% type classification accuracy, even under weak signal conditions with long distances and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). These findings highlight the potential of imaging-free methods for robust long-range detection of small targets in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Physical Formalism Of Directional Quantum Evolution Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we introduce the Directional Quantum Evolution Theory (DQET), a covariant reformulation of quantum mechanics where evolution takes place along a four-vector-defined arbitrary timelike direction. This method restores space-time symmetry and provides a geometric interpretation of energy as a frame-dependent projection by substituting a directional derivative for the traditional time derivative. DQET establishes a conserved probability current, supports proper-time evolution, and recovers the Schrodinger in suitable bounds. It provides a covariant solution to the quantum twin conundrum and predicts observable phase discrepancies between systems traveling along distinct trajectories. With encouraging extensions to curved spacetime, the theory offers a cohesive framework for relativistic quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Landau level spectroscopy of Dirac fermions in millimeter-scale twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the Prufer transform that connects the dynamical system on the torus and the Hill equation, which is interpreted as either the equation of motion for the parametric oscillator or the Schrodinger equation with periodic potential. The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a variational Monte Carlo framework that combines neural-network quantum states with the Lorentz integral transform technique to compute the dynamical properties of self-bound quantum many-body systems in continuous Hilbert spaces. While broadly applicable to various quantum systems, including atoms and molecules, in this initial application we focus on the photoabsorption cross section of light nuclei, where benchmarks against numerically exact techniques are available. Our accurate theoretical predictions are complemented by robust uncertainty quantification, enabling meaningful comparisons with experiments. We demonstrate that a simple nuclear Hamiltonian, based on a leading-order pionless effective field theory expansion and known to accurately reproduce the ground-state energies of nuclei with $A\leq 20$ nucleons also provides a reliable description of the photoabsorption cross section.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Speed Limit and Entanglement in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <title>Gaussian tripartite steering in Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite steering is a fundamental quantum resource that is uniquely suited to tackling complex relativistic quantum information challenges, but its properties in the gravitational field context remain to be elucidated. We study the distribution of Gaussian tripartite steering in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. Our results show that physically accessible $2\rightarrow 1$ steerability remains robust at any Hawking temperature, which contrasts with the behavior of $1\rightarrow 1$ steering that experiences ``sudden death" as the Hawking temperature increases, making $2\rightarrow 1$ steerability a more reliable candidate for relativistic quantum information tasks. Notably, we observe that the sudden death of quantum steering is accompanied by a peak in steering asymmetry, signifying a critical transition from two-way steering to one-way steering in the relativistic three-mode system. We find that the Hawking effect can generate inaccessible two-way steering of a bipartite system in both directions, as shown in [Phys. Rev. D 93, 125011 (2016)], while it can only generate physically inaccessible one-way $2\rightarrow 1$ steering in tripartite systems. These insights enhance our understanding of the redistribution of multipartite steering near the event horizon of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) that allows a large quantum circuit to be executed simultaneously on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) becomes a promising approach to increase the scalability of quantum computing. It is natural to envision the near-future DQC platform as a multi-tenant cluster of QPUs, called a Quantum Cloud. However, no existing DQC work has addressed the two key problems of running DQC in a multi-tenant quantum cloud: placing multiple quantum circuits to QPUs and scheduling network resources to complete these jobs. This work is the first attempt to design a circuit placement and resource scheduling framework for a multi-tenant environment. The proposed framework is called CloudQC, which includes two main functional components, circuit placement and network scheduler, with the objectives of optimizing both quantum network cost and quantum computing time. Experimental results with real quantum circuit workloads show that CloudQC significantly reduces the average job completion time compared to existing DQC placement algorithms for both single-circuit and multi-circuit DQC. We envision this work will motivate more future work on network-aware quantum cloud.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference in Quantum Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditioning is a key feature in probabilistic programming to enable modeling the influence of data (also known as observations) to the probability distribution described by such programs. Determining the posterior distribution is also known as Bayesian inference. This paper equips a quantum while-language with conditioning, defines its denotational and operational semantics over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and shows their equivalence. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of weakest (liberal) precondition-transformers and derive inductive characterizations of these transformers. It is shown how w(l)p-transformers can be used to assess the effect of Bayesian inference on (possibly diverging) quantum programs.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermiticity appears ubiquitously in various open classical and quantum systems and enriches classification of topological phases. However, the role of nonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice translations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify non-Hermitian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian topological crystalline phases or non-Hermitian topological phases protected solely by internal symmetry. Specifically, we elucidate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network For Remaining Useful Life Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network frame- work, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures. Our findings highlight the poten- tial of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.</description>

      <title>Universal language model with the intervention of quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines language modeling based on the theory of quantum mechanics. It focuses on the introduction of quantum mechanics into the symbol-meaning pairs of language in order to build a representation model of natural language. At the same time, it is realized that word embedding, which is widely used as a basic technique for statistical language modeling, can be explained and improved by the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. On this basis, this paper continues to try to use quantum statistics and other related theories to study the mathematical representation, natural evolution and statistical properties of natural language. It is also assumed that the source of such quantum properties is the physicality of information. The feasibility of using quantum theory to model natural language is pointed out through the construction of a experimental code. The paper discusses, in terms of applications, the possible help of the theory in constructing generative models that are popular nowadays. A preliminary discussion of future applications of the theory to quantum computers is also presented.</description>

      <title>Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</description>

      <title>Tripartite State Characterization via Activated Bipartite Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a procedure to identify and classify genuine tripartite entanglement in pure 3-qubit states via the Activated Bipartite Entanglement (ABE), which is defined here as the difference between the Entanglement of Assistance and the Entanglement of Formation. We show that for pure states belonging to one of the two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e., GHZ or W states, the ABE is always greater than zero. For separable and biseparable states it is always null. In addition, our approach is capable to distinguish between genuine tripartite entangled states, those belonging to the GHZ-class from those belonging to the W-class. We also present an experimental proposal, by using linear optical circuits and internal degrees of freedom of a single photon, to measure the ABE and to verify the characterization via activated entanglement. The circuit simulation shows an excellent agreement with theoretical prediction for a wide class of GHZ and W states.</description>

Abstract: Qubit noise spectroscopy is an important tool for the experimental investigation of open quantum systems. However, conventional techniques for noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require measurements of the noise spectral density at many different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative approach to noise spectroscopy, which requires fewer resources, and relies on direct measurement of arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectral density. This method uses random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations, which are chosen using algorithms for phase retrieval. These measurements allow us to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through the entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can be immersed in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In the appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <title>Q-Newton: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheduling for Accelerating Neural Network Training with Newton's Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating &amp; reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Quantum Transpilers: Evaluating the Performance of qiskit-braket-provider, qBraid-SDK, and Pytket Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of popular SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers (that is transpilers that takes a quantum circuit from an initial SDK and output a quantum circuit in another SDK), focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. To ensure unbiased evaluation and accommodate diverse quantum computing scenarios, we developed two dedicated tools: RandomQC, for generating random quantum circuits across various types (pure random, VQE-like, and SDK-specific circuits), and Benchmarq, to streamline the benchmarking process. Using these tools, we benchmarked prominent quantum transpilers as of February 2024. Our results highlight the superior performance of the qiskit-braket-provider, a specialized transpiler from Qiskit to Braket, achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2%. The qBraid-SDK, offering generalized transpilation across multiple SDKs, demonstrated robust but slower performance. The pytket extensions, while fast, faced limitations with complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation approach. In particular, the exceptional performance of the qiskit-bracket-provider stems not only from its specialization but also from its architecture, which combines one-to-one transpilation with gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing both speed and capability. This study aims to provide practical guidelines to users of SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers and guidance to developers for improving the design and development of future tools.</description>

      <title>Scalable improvement of the generalized Toffoli gate realization using trapped-ion-based qutrits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient implementation of the Toffoli gate is of conceptual importance for running various quantum algorithms, including Grover's search and Shor's integer factorization. However, direct implementation of the Toffoli gate either entails a prohibitive increase in the number of two-qubit gates or requires ancilla qubits, whereas both of these resources are limited in the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable $N$-qubit Toffoli gate improvement using $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ trapped-ion-based optical-metastable-ground encoded qutrits for the cases of up to $N$=10. With the use of the Molmer-Sorensen gate as a basic entangling operation, we compare the standard qubit decomposition with the qutrit approach, where upper levels are used as ancillas.The presented decomposition requires only global control of the ancilla levels, which simplifies experimental implementation of the proposed approach. Using the example of a three-qubit Grover's search, we also demonstrate an increase in the algorithm's accuracy by monitoring the leakage from the qubit subspace during a qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementation.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of planar graphs. Atserias et al. [JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general. The NPA hierarchy gives a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations of quantum isomorphism. Recently, Roberson and Seppelt [ICALP'23] obtained a homomorphism indistinguishability characterization of the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism. We prove a quantum analogue of this result by showing that each level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism of graphs is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over an appropriate class of planar graphs. By combining the convergence of the NPA hierarchy with the fact that the union of these graph classes is the set of all planar graphs, we are able to give a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] that avoids the use of the theory of quantum groups. This homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also allows us to give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Block encoding by signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</description>

      <title>The robustness condition for general disordered discrete time crystals, and subspace-thermal DTCs from phase transitions between different n-tuple DTCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experimental implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces of definite charges are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization cannot be used to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework for the robustness of DTCs from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is rigorously proved if the system satisfies a certain condition where the mixing length, defined by the Hamming distance of the symmetry charges, does not exceed a global threshold. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing DTCs realized by kicking disordered systems, where conventional MBL-DTCs can be regarded as a special case of the subspace-thermal DTC with the subspace dimension being one, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to systems with higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as to higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with imperfect clocks, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg scaling up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</description>

      <title>Phase-space gaussian ensemble quantum camouflage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the phase-space description of the Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to a subset of non-linear Hamiltonians in position and momentum, gaussian functions are identified as the quantum ground state. Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\,p)$, is constrained by the $\partial ^2 H^{W} / \partial q \partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.</description>

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a pedagogical, self-contained, introduction to randomized benchmarking.

      <title>Qudit Shadow Estimation Based on the Clifford Group and the Power of a Single Magic Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadow estimation is a sample-efficient protocol for learning the properties of a quantum system using randomized measurements, but the current understanding of qudit shadow estimation is quite limited compared with the qubit setting. Here we clarify the sample complexity of qudit shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, where the local dimension $d$ is an odd prime. Notably, we show that the overhead of qudit shadow estimation over the qubit counterpart is only $\mathcal{O}(d)$, independent of the qudit number $n$, although the set of stabilizer states may deviate exponentially from a 3-design with respect to the third moment operator. Furthermore, by adding one layer of magic gates, we propose a simple circuit that can significantly boost the efficiency. Actually, a single magic gate can already eliminate the $\mathcal{O}(d)$ overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap from the qubit setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in space science and technologies offer exciting prospects for investigating novel research that is unattainable within terrestrial laboratories. Here we propose the implementation of space-based quantum sensing to explore ultralight new particles beyond the standard model. The central idea involves probing long-range interactions between spin ensembles of space quantum sensors and the particles residing within Earth, mediated by ultralight particles. We show that such interactions can be substantially enhanced in space platforms and thus increase the search sensitivity. In contrast to their terrestrial counterparts, space-based quantum searches exhibit remarkable velocity enhancements, approaching the first cosmic speed, and thus enables the exploration of unexplored parameter space concerning ultralight new particles. Furthermore, the substantial abundance of electrons and nucleons within Earth plays a crucial role in extending the scope of our mission. Our projected search sensitivity can surpass the sensitivities of both terrestrial experiments and proposals by up to approximately 7 orders of magnitude. We also briefly discuss other space mission, including ``space-ground integrated" network of quantum sensors for dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Non-Classicality and Non-adiabaticity in a Single Trapped Ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped ion systems present non-classical characteristics such as squeezed states that show a quantum advantage in quantum sensing, quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics. We analyze the non-classical characteristics of a system described by a single ion trapped by a periodic potential field. Within the regime of non-adiabatic manipulation of the potential field, the dynamics of motion of the center of mass of the ion can be described by a dimensionless parameter called the non-adiabatic parameter $Q^{*}$. This parameter allows us to distinguish the classical and non-classical characteristics of the system. Using the equations of motion of observables in the Heisenberg picture, we propose an analysis of the unitary time evolution operator and discuss the squeezing behavior in the state of motion of the ion. The results shown can serve as a basis to discuss the presence of squeezing as a resource in quantum thermodynamics in the non-adiabatic regime in actual achievable experimental limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-chip quantum sources based on nonlinear processes are pivotal components in integrated photonics, driving significant advancements in quantum information technologies over recent decades. Usually, the pump coherence has been considered to be crucial for ensuring the quality of generated states, therefore incoherent light is rarely used in quantum information processing. In this work, we explore and reveal the constructive influence of pumped temporal incoherence on the quantum properties of photon sources. Taking silicon waveguides as nonlinear media, we theoretically show that temporal incoherence of light can improve pumping utilization efficiency, resulting in higher source brightness in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process, and the spectrally uncorrelated nature of incoherent light is transferred to the generated photon source, allowing high-purity state preparation. Experimentally, we obtain a higher photon pair generation rate and the lower heralded second-order autocorrelation with an Amplified Spontaneous Emission source. Additionally, we successfully generate a polarization-entangled state with Bell inequality violation of S = 2.64 and a fidelity of 95.7%. Our study reveals the mechanism behind incoherently pumped quantum states and presents a method for generating photon sources using an easily accessible incoherent light.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bayesian Networks for Machine Learning in Oil-Spill Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has shown promise in diverse applications such as environmental monitoring, healthcare diagnostics, and financial modeling. However, its practical implementation faces challenges, including limited quantum hardware and the complexity of integrating quantum algorithms with classical systems. One critical challenge is handling imbalanced datasets, where rare events are often misclassified due to skewed data distributions. Quantum Bayesian Networks (QBNs) address this issue by enhancing feature extraction and improving the classification of rare events such as oil spills. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach utilizing QBNs to classify satellite-derived imbalanced datasets, distinguishing ``oil-spill'' from ``non-spill'' regions. QBNs leverage probabilistic reasoning and quantum state preparation to integrate quantum enhancements into classical machine learning architectures. Our approach achieves a 0.99 AUC score, demonstrating its efficacy in anomaly detection and advancing precise environmental monitoring and management. While integration enhances classification performance, dataset-specific challenges require further optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</description>

Abstract: We present fast parallel rearrangement of single atoms in optical tweezers into arbitrary geometries by updating holograms displayed by an ultra fast spatial light modulator. Using linear interpolation of the tweezer position and the optical phase between the start and end arrays, we can calculate and display holograms every few ms, limited by technology. To show the versatility of our method, we sort the same atomic sample into multiple geometries with success probabilities of 0.996(2) per rearrangement cycle. This makes the method a useful tool for rearranging large atom arrays for quantum computation and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

      <title>Local vs non-local dynamics in cavity-coupled Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</description>

      <title>Strong and noise-tolerant entanglement in dissipative optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09541v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic entanglement, as a critical quantum resource in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth depends on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Polarization entanglement and qubit error rate dependence on the exciton-phonon coupling in self-assembled quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. A near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is essential to minimize qubit error rates in key distribution. This study theoretically investigates the polarization entangled photon pairs produced by a quantum-dot radiative cascade located within a micropillar cavity. To incorporate the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling in a quantum dot-cavity system, we develop a polaron master equation theory and investigate how it affects the degree of entanglement and qubit error rate. We derive analytical expressions of various phonon-induced incoherent rates and demonstrate that one-photon incoherent rates predominate, substantially diminishing the degree of entanglement. It is shown that at elevated temperatures, the role of cavity-mediated effects such as cross-coupling between exciton states, ac-Stark shift, and multiphoton emission gets reduced owing to the phonon-mediated renormalization of the cavity coupling and Rabi frequency. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol and show the evolution of qubit error rate at elevated temperatures of the phonon bath.</description>

      <title>Deciding Local Unitary Equivalence of Graph States in Quasi-Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</description>

Abstract: An ordered moment approach to exact open quantum dynamics is presented, which bypasses the Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism. The hierarchical equations of motion are constructed using Wick's contraction, which follows specific orderings of the bath's creation and annihilation operators. Our approach moves beyond the traditional influence functional formalism, offering a more intuitive and direct framework, and extends the applicability of theory to nonlinear system--bath coupling scenarios.</description>

      <title>Long-range nonstabilizerness from quantum codes, orders, and correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding nonstabilizerness (aka quantum magic) in many-body quantum systems, particularly its interplay with entanglement, represents an important quest in quantum computation and many-body physics. Drawing natural motivations from the study of quantum phases of matter and entanglement, we systematically investigate the notion of long-range magic (LRM), defined as nonstabilizerness that cannot be (approximately) erased by shallow local unitary circuits. In doing so, we prove a robust generalization of the Bravyi--K\"onig theorem. By establishing connections to the theory of fault-tolerant logical gates on quantum error-correcting codes, we show that certain families of topological stabilizer code states exhibit LRM. Then, we show that all ground states of topological orders that cannot be realized by topological stabilizer codes, such as Fibonacci topological order, exhibit LRM, which yields a ``no lowest-energy trivial magic'' result. Building on our considerations of LRM, we discuss the classicality of short-range magic from e.g.~preparation and learning perspectives, and put forward a ``no low-energy trivial magic'' (NLTM) conjecture that has key motivation in the quantum PCP context. We also connect correlation functions with LRM, demonstrating certain LRM state families by correlation properties. Most of our concepts and techniques do not rely on geometric locality and can be extended to systems with general connectivity. Our study leverages and sheds new light on the interplay between quantum resources, error correction and fault tolerance, complexity theory, and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of up to $7.9 \pm 0.6$ dB, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed light. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random numbers are essential for security against quantum algorithms. Randomness as a beacon is a service being provided for companies and governments to upgrade their security standards from RSA to PQC-QKD or PQC-RSA protocols. Both security mechanisms assume trust in the service provider unless one aims for device-independent protocols. How does an entity ensure that the beacon service has a quantum signature other than relying on faith? Specifically, given a bit-stream, can a user verify a quantum signature in it? Researchers claim this is indecipherable and have stated a no-go theorem for post-processed bit-streams [Physical Review A \textbf{109}, 022243 (2024)]. In this article, we corroborate the results of the no-go theorem while discussing its nuances using two different random number generators and four test methods. These include the NIST statistical test suite and machine learning algorithms that strengthen the theorem. This work is relevant for companies and governments using QRNG, provided to enhance security against quantum threats.</description>

      <title>Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imperfect measurements are a prevalent source of error across quantum computing platforms, significantly degrading the logical error rates achievable on current hardware. To mitigate this issue, rich measurement data referred to as soft information has been proposed to efficiently identify and correct measurement errors as they occur. In this work, we model soft information decoding across a variety of physical qubit platforms and decoders and showcase how soft information can make error correction viable at lower code distances and higher physical error rates than is otherwise possible. We simulate the effects of soft information decoding on quantum memories for surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes, and evaluate the error suppression performance of soft decoders against traditional decoders. For near-term devices with noise regimes close to the surface code threshold, our simulations show that soft information decoding can provide up to 10% higher error suppression on superconducting qubits and up to 20% stronger error suppression on neutral atom qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-target gates offer the potential to reduce gate depth in syndrome extraction for quantum error correction. Although neutral-atom quantum computers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that avoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to single-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\otimes N}) gates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control and have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages tailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the control and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we design smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up to 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom placement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path to implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly reducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</description>

      <title>Protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a quantum-dot loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum system constrained to a degenerate energy eigenspace can undergo a nontrival time evolution upon adiabatic driving, described by a non-Abelian Berry phase. This type of dynamics may provide logical gates in quantum computing that are robust against timing errors. A strong candidate to realize such holonomic quantum gates is an electron or hole spin qubit trapped in a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor, whose twofold Kramers degeneracy is protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose and quantitatively analyze protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a loop of quantum dots. One of these protocols allows to characterize the local internal Zeeman field directions in the dots of the loop. We expect a near-term realisation of these protocols, as all key elements have been already demonstrated in spin-qubit experiments. These experiments would be important to assess the potential of holonomic quantum gates for spin-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Differential High-Frequency Lock-In Probe for Laser-Induced Vacuum Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of laser-induced vacuum birefringence through the use of pulsed lasers coupled to femtosecond optical enhancement cavities. This measurement technique features cavity-enhanced pump and probe pulses, as well as an independent control pulse. The control pulse allows for a differential measurement where the final signal is obtained using high-frequency lock-in detection, greatly mitigating time-dependent cavity birefringence as an important and possibly prohibitive systematic effect. In addition, the method features the economical use of laser power, and results in a relatively simple experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current-electric field characteristics in transport through a nanoelectromechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</description>
