      <title>Characterization of Coulomb Interactions in Electron Transport through a Single Hetero-Helicene Molecular Junction Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of the structural and electron transport properties of single chiral molecules provides critical insights into the interplay between their electronic structure and electrochemical environments, providing broader implications given the significance of molecular chirality in chiroptical applications and pharmaceutical sciences. Here, we examined the topographic and electronic features of a recently developed chiral molecule, B,N-embedded double hetero[7]helicene, at the edge of Cu(100) supported NaCl thin film with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. An electron transport energy gap of 3.2 eV is measured, which is significantly larger than the energy difference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals given by theoretical calculations or optical measurements. Through first principles calculations, we demonstrated that this energy discrepancy results from the Coulomb interaction between the tunneling electron and the molecule's electrons. This occurs in electron transport processes when the molecule is well decoupled from the electrodes by the insulating decoupling layers, leading to a temporary ionization of the molecule during electron tunneling. Beyond revealing properties concerning a specific molecule, our findings underscore the key role of Coulomb interactions in modulating electron transport in molecular junctions, providing insights into the interpretation of scanning tunneling spectroscopy features of molecules decoupled by insulating layers.</description>

      <title>Measurement of transition frequencies and hyperfine constants of molecular iodine at 520.2 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the transition frequencies of the hyperfine components in the four lines (P(34) 39-0, R(36) 39-0, P(33) 39-0, and R(35) 39-0) of the B-X transitions of molecular iodine at 520.2 nm. The 520.2 nm laser was generated by wavelength-converting the output of a 1560.6 nm external-cavity diode laser using a dual-pitch periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. The frequencies were measured by counting the heterodyne beats between the laser stabilized at the frequencies of the hyperfine components and a frequency comb synchronized with a hydrogen maser. We determined the transition frequencies of the a1 components with relative uncertainties of 1*10-11; the uncertainty was limited by the impurity of the molecular iodine in the cell. From the measured hyperfine splitting frequencies, we calculated the hyperfine constants of these four transitions to obtain the rotational dependence of the excited-state hyperfine constants.</description>

      <title>Concurrent processes in the time-resolved solvation and Coulomb ejection of sodium ions in helium nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pump-probe experiments [Albrechtsen {\em et al.}, Nature {\bf 623}, 319 (2023)] have explored the gradual solvation of sodium cations in contact with helium nanodroplets, using a fully solvated xenon atom as a probe exerting a repulsive interaction after its own ionization. In this Communication we computationally examine by means of atomistic ring-polymer molecular dynamics the mechanisms of successive ionizations, shell formation, and Coulomb ejection that all take place within tens of picoseconds, and show that their interplay subtly depends on the time delay between the two ionizations but also on the droplet size. The possibility of forming solvated Na$^+$Xe non-covalent complexes under a few tens of picoseconds in such experiments is ruled out based on fragment distributions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures containing a very strongly polar compound. 12. Systems with nitrobenzene or 1-nitroalkane and hydrocarbons or 1-alkanols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures involving nitrobenzene and hydrocarbons, or 1-alkanols and 1-nitroalkane, or nitrobenzene have been investigated based on a whole set of thermophysical properties available in the literature: excess molar functions (enthalpies, entropies, isobaric heat capacities, and volumes), vapour-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria, permittivities or dynamic viscosities. In addition, the mixtures have been studied by means of the DISQUAC, ERAS, and UNIFAC models, and the concentration-concentration structure factor. The corresponding DISQUAC and ERAS interaction parameters are reported. In alkane mixtures, dipolar interactions between 1-nitroalkane molecules are weakened when the size of the polar compound increases, accordingly with the relative variation of their effective dipolar moment. Dipolar interactions are stronger in nitrobenzene solutions than in those containing the smaller 1-nitropropane, although both nitroalkanes have very similar effective dipole moment (aromaticity effect). Systems with 1-alkanols are characterized by dipolar interactions between like molecules which sharply increases when the alkanol size increases. Simultaneously, interactions between unlike molecules become weaker, as the OH group is then more sterically hindered. Interactions between unlike molecules are stronger in systems with nitromethane than in nitrobenzene solutions. The replacement of nitromethane by nitroethane in systems with a given 1-alkanol leads to strengthen those effects related with the alcohol self-association. Permittivity data and results on Kirkwood correlation factors show that the addition of 1-alkanol to a nitroalkane leads to cooperative effects, which increase the dipolar polarization of the solution, in such way that the destruction of the existing structure in pure liquids is partially counterbalanced. This effect is less important when longer 1-alkanols are involved.</description>

      <title>Characterization of 1-alkanol + strongly polar compound mixtures from thermophysical data and the application of the Kirkwood-Buff integrals and Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures formed by 1-alkanol and one strongly polar compound (nitromethane (NM), ethanenitrile (EtN), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sulfolane (SULF), nitrobenzene (NTBz) or benzonitrile (BzCN)) have been investigated on the basis of a set of thermophysical data, which includes: excess molar functions (enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, Gibbs energies, $G_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, entropies, $T S_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, isobaric heat capacities, $C_{p \text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$); liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE), excess permittivities and deviations from the linearity of dynamic viscosities. In addition, calculations have been conducted to determine the Kirkwood-Buff integrals and the Kirkwood correlations factors, $g_{\text{K}}$, of the investigated mixtures. In the former case, DISQUAC has been employed for modeling the needed vapour-liquid equilibria data. Many systems under consideration are characterized by dipolar interactions between like molecules and have positive values of $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, $C_{p \text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ and $T S_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$. On the other hand, alkanol-solvent interactions, for mixtures with a fixed 1-alkanol, become weakened in the sequence: DMSO $\approx$ SULF &gt; EtN &gt; NM &gt; BzCN &gt; NTBz. In systems with a given solvent, such interactions become also weaker when the chain length of the 1-alkanol is increased. Interestingly, the considered mixtures also show strong structural effects. Results on Kirkwood-Buff integrals reveal that nitriles are more preferred than nitroalkanes around a central alcohol molecule. Calculations on $g_{\text{K}}$ show that, in terms of the mixture polarization, the systems are rather unstructured, and that this trend becomes more important when the 1-alkanol size increases in solutions with a given solvent.</description>

      <title>Volumetric and Viscosimetric Measurements for Methanol + CH$_3$-O-(CH$_2$CH$_2$O)$_n$-CH$_3$ ($n$ = 2, 3, 4) Mixtures at (293.15-303.15) K and Atmospheric Pressure: Application of the ERAS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Densities, $\rho$, and kinematic viscosities, $\nu$, have been determined at atmospheric pressure and at (293.15-303.15) K for binary mixtures formed by methanol and one linear polyether of the type CH$_3$-O-(CH$_2$CH$_2$O)$_n$-CH$_3$ ($n$ = 2,3,4). The $\rho$ values are used to compute excess molar volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, and, together with $\nu$ results, dynamic viscosities ($\eta$). Deviations from linear dependence on mole fraction for viscosity, $\Delta \eta$, are also provided. Different semi-empirical equations have been employed to correlate viscosity data. Particularly, the equations used are: Grunberg-Nissan, Hind, Frenkel, Katti-Chaudhri, McAllister and Heric. Calculations show that better results are obtained from the Hind equation. The $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values are large and negative and contrast with the positive excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, available in the literature, for these systems. This indicates that structural effects are dominant. The $\Delta \eta$ results are positive and correlate well with the difference in volume of the mixture compounds confirming the importance of structural effects. The temperature dependences of $\eta$ and of the molar volume have been used to calculate enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs energies, $\Delta G^*$, of viscous flow. It is demonstrated that $\Delta G^*$ is essentially determined by enthalpic effects. Methanol + CH$_3$-O-(CH$_2$CH$_2$O)$_n$-CH$_3$ mixtures have been treated in the framework of the ERAS model. Results on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ are acceptable, while the composition dependence of the $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ curves is poorly represented. This has been ascribed to the existence of strong dipolar and structural effects in the present solutions.</description>

      <title>Ensemble density functional theory of ground and excited energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kohn-Sham density-functional energy expression is derived for any (ground or excited) state within a given many-electron ensemble along with the stationarity condition it fulfills with respect to the ensemble density, thus giving access to both physical energy levels and individual-state densities, in principle exactly. We also provide working equations for the evaluation of the latter from the true static ensemble density-density linear response function. Unlike in Gould's recent ensemble potential functional approach to excited states [arXiv:2404.12593], we use the ensemble density as sole basic variable. While a state-specific KS potential naturally emerges from the present formalism, at the exact ensemble Hartree-exchange-only (Hx) level of approximation, the standard implementation of orbital-optimized DFT for excited states is recovered when recycling the regular ground-state Hx-correlation functional in this context.</description>

      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance is revolutionizing in parallel with the development of methodology and all electronics and hardware around it. The primary objective of such modifications is to make the system more reliable and sensitive. Almost a decade ago, Bruker introduced an Avance NEO console with an extended dynamic range of the receiver gain (RG). The system offered a maximum sensitivity even at very low RG. This feature is handy in the case of hyperpolarization when too much signal can cause clipping of the free induction decay signal. We analyzed the RG profile for our spectrometer's 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei and found nonmonotonous sensitivity behavior characterized by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For example, 13C SNR at RG = 18 is 5.5% higher than SNR at maximum RG = 101 and 51.6% higher than at RG = 20.2. Having found this, we advertise here that other NMR users with any spectrometers should calibrate their SNR vs. RG and find the RG value right for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not know about the actual performance of each system. We offer a tool and strategy for such an optimization and exemplify the benefits of using SNR-adjusted RG value with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrodeposition is a fundamental process in electrochemistry, and has applications in numerous industries, such as corrosion protection, decorative finishing, energy storage, catalysis, and electronics. While there is a long history of using electrodeposition, its application for controlled nanostructure growth is limited. The establishment of an atomic-scale understanding of the electrodeposition process and dynamics is crucial to enable the controlled fabrication of metal nanoparticles and other nanostructures. Significant advancements in molecular simulation capabilities and the electronic structure theory of electrified solid-liquid interfaces bring theory closer to realistic applications, but a gap remains between realistic applications, theoretical understanding of dynamics, and atomistic simulation. In this review we briefly summarize the current state-of-the-art computational techniques available for the simulation of electrodeposition and electrochemical growth on surfaces, and identify the remaining open challenges.</description>

      <title>Learning Markovian Dynamics with Spectral Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-time behavior of many complex molecular systems is often governed by slow relaxation dynamics that can be described by a few reaction coordinates referred to as collective variables (CVs). However, identifying CVs hidden in a high-dimensional configuration space poses a fundamental challenge in chemical physics. To address this problem, we expand on a recently introduced deep-learning technique called spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22, 5216-5220]. Spectral map learns CVs by maximizing a spectral gap between slow and fast eigenvalues of a Markov transition matrix describing anisotropic diffusion. An introduced modification in the learning algorithm allows spectral map to represent multiscale free-energy landscapes. Through a Markov state model analysis, we validate that spectral map learns slow CVs related to the dominant relaxation timescales and discerns between long-lived metastable states.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process, giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</description>

      <title>HamLib: A library of Hamiltonians for benchmarking quantum algorithms and hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

Abstract: Understanding individual ions in solutions is essential for advancing our knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, tracking and detecting ions at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a challenge. We introduce a strategy for visualization and differentiation of different ions in liquid environment via point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the ion sensor. Ions interacting with the optically active point defects in h-BN alter emission properties, allowing us to capture these changes and visualize single ions. Using Li+ in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed a spectral shift of over 10 nm upon Li+ addition, and an over 50 nm red shift with applied electric fields due to reactions between Li+ and h-BN point defects. Frequency domain analysis further revealed the rapid dynamics of ion migration and the slow electrochemical reactions. We further spectroscopically differentiated various ions (H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Al3+) in aqueous solution. Each ion, with its distinct electron cloud configuration, interacts distinctively with the electron clouds of h-BN defects, resulting in specific and identifiable spectroscopic signatures. This ion sensing platform enables the direct visualization and differentiation of individual ions in a liquid environment, offering insights into chemical reactions at the single-ion level. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids, including but not limited to biology, battery technology, and environmental science.</description>
