      <title>Enhancement of Superconductivity in WP via Oxide-Assisted Chemical Vapor Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten monophosphide (WP) has been reported to superconduct below 0.8 K, and theoretical work has predicted an unconventional Cooper pairing mechanism. Here we present data for WP single crystals grown by means of chemical vapor transport (CVT) of WO3, P, and I2. In comparison to synthesis using WP powder as a starting material, this technique results in samples with substantially decreased low-temperature scattering and favors a more three dimensional morphology. We also find that the resistive superconducting transitions in these samples begin above 1 K. Variation in Tc is often found in strongly correlated superconductors, and its presence in WP could be the result of influence from a competing order and/or a non s-wave gap.</description>

      <title>Impact of Pressure and Apical Oxygen Vacancies on Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has recently emerged as a promising system for high-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC). In this work, we investigate the fate of the SC properties in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under pressure, focusing on the effects of structural deformation and apical oxygen vacancies. Employing a low-energy effective $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the slave-boson mean-field approach, we demonstrate that the SC pairing strength is significantly enhanced in the high-pressure tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase compared to the ambient pressure orthorhombic $Amam$ phase. Furthermore, by simulating random configurations of apical oxygen vacancies, we show that oxygen vacancies suppress both pairing strength and superfluid density. These results underscore the critical role of pressure and oxygen stoichiometry in tuning the SC of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing key insights into optimizing its high-$T_c$ behavior.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new phase in thin flakes of KV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of magnetotransport measurements on KV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes under pressure. Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.</description>

      <title>Isotropic superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence of superconductivity (SC) has recently been reported in pressurized La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, providing a new platform to explore high-temperature superconductivity. However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Nodeless Superconducting State in the Presence of Zero-Field Staggered Magnetization in CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ with a critical temperature $T_c$ $\approx$ 0.34 K exhibits an intriguing magnetic field-induced transition between likely distinct superconducting states. In zero field, an even-parity state emerges within another ordered phase of unknown origin with $T_0$ $\approx$ 0.54 K. Here, we investigated the spin-singlet state of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ at temperatures down to $\approx$ 0.02$T_c$ by means of local magnetization measurements performed using micro-Hall probe magnetometry. We determined the temperature dependencies of the lower critical field for both in-plane and out-of-plane field directions, and demonstrated their consistency with predominantly fully gapped superconductivity. In the magnetization measured along the $a$ axis, we found a clear increase below $T_0$, while no similar anomaly was observed along the $c$ axis. Our results place important constraints on the spin-singlet order parameter in CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and highlight an important role of static magnetic moments in the nature of $T_0$ phase.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Favored Anisotropic Phase Stiffness in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In unconventional superconductors such as cuprates and iron pnictides and chalcogenides, phase stiffness - a measure of the energy cost associated with superconducting phase variations - is on the same order of magnitude as the strength of Cooper pairing, translating to superconductivity governed by phase fluctuations. However, due to a lack of a direct experimental probe, there remains a fundamental gap in establishing microscopic picture between unconventional superconductivity and phase fluctuations. Here we show a vector current technique that allows for in-situ angle-resolved transport measurements, providing exclusive evidence suggesting an anisotropic nature of phase stiffness in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. Pronounced anisotropy of in-plane resistance manifests itself in both normal and superconducting transition states, indicating crystal symmetry breaking. Remarkably, the electric conductivity of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 peaks at 125{\deg} between the direction of the current and crystal principal axis, but this angle evolves to 160{\deg} near zero-resistance temperature. Further measurements reveal that the superconductivity is favored along a direction with minimized phase fluctuations, an orientation strikingly deviating from the symmetric direction imposed by both electronic anisotropy and the underlying crystal lattice. Identical measurements conducted on a prototypical cuprate superconductor yield consistent results, suggesting that this previously unknown behavior could be ubiquitous. By shielding insight into the contrasting anisotropy between electron fluid and superfluid, our findings provide clues for a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductors</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations-driven Melting Transitions in Two-dimensional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are pivotal in driving quantum phase transitions, exemplified by the quantum melting of Wigner crystals into Fermi liquids in electron systems. However, their impact on superconducting systems near zero temperature, particularly in the superconductor-insulator/metal transition, remains poorly understood. In this study, through electric transport measurements on the two-dimensional (2D) superconductor (SnS)1.17NbS2, we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations induce vortex displacement from their mean position, leading to the quantum melting of vortex solid near zero temperature. Quantitative analysis reveals the magnetic field-induced anomalous metal originates from this quantum melting transition, with energy dissipation governed by quantum fluctuations-driven vortex displacements. Remarkably, further extending this analysis to various 2D superconductors yields the same results, and many properties of anomalous metal can be qualitatively understood within the framework of quantum melting. The connection between the quantum melting of vortex solids and dissipative anomalous metal opens a novel pathway towards understanding quantum phase transitions through vortex dynamics, providing new insights on both fields.</description>

      <title>Slave-spin approach to the Anderson-Josephson quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a strongly interacting quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads using a slave-spin representation of the dot. At the mean-field level the problem maps into a resonant level model with superconducting leads, coupled to an auxiliary spin-1/2 variable accounting for the parity of the dot. We obtain the mean-field phase diagram, showing a transition between a Kondo (singlet) and a local moment (doublet) regime, corresponding to the $0-\pi$ transition of the junction. The mean-field theory qualitatively captures the Kondo singlet phase and its competition with superconductivity for weak values of the BCS gap, including the non-trivial dependence of the Andreev bound states on the interaction, but fails in the doublet regime where it predicts a dot decoupled from the bath. Using diagrammatic techniques and a random phase approximation, we include fluctuations on top of the mean-field theory to describe finite-frequency dynamics of the effective spin variable. This leads to the formation of high-energy Hubbard bands in the spectral function and a coherent Kondo peak with a BCS gap at low energies. Finally, we compute the Josephson current and the induced superconducting correlations on the dot.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome systems have garnered considerable attention due to the unique features of the sublattice structure and band topology. The recently discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A = K, Rb, Cs) host a rich array of symmetry-breaking phases, including exotic charge density waves (CDW), electronic nematicity, pair density waves (PDW) and superconductivity. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the diverse phases, several key issues remain contentious, such as a solid clarification of the time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRS-breaking) in the CDW order and its implications for the nature of superconducting (SC) pairing symmetry. This review aims to shed light on the transport properties of these intertwined phases, emphasizing the pivotal role that transport measurements play in uncovering the non-trivial quantum states of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a systematic approach to construct superconducting order parameters based on the spin space group. Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial and spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting channels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be different. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and discuss the possible superconducting ground states as well as the interplay between superconducting states and magnetic orders. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to realistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting gap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic ordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as $p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we propose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport processes. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) within specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of the superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings underscore the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental investigation and enhancement of CAR.</description>
