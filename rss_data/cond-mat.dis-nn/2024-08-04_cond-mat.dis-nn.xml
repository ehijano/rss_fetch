      <title>Thermal conductivity in modified oxide glasses is governed by modal phase changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of glasses is well-known to be significantly harder to theoretically describe compared to crystalline materials. Because of this fact, the fundamental understanding of thermal conductivity in glasses remain extremely poor when moving beyond the case of simple glasses, e.g., glassy SiO$_2$, and into so-called 'modified' oxide glasses, that is, glasses where other oxides (e.g. alkali oxides) have been added to break up the network and alter e.g. elastic and thermal properties. This lack of knowledge is apparent despite how modified glasses comprise the far majority of known glasses. In the present work we study an archetypical series of sodium silicate ($x\text{Na}_2\text{O}\text{-}(100\text{-}x)\text{SiO}_2$) glasses. Analyses of modal contributions reveal how increasing Na$_2$O content induces increasing vibrational localization with a change of vibrations to be less ordered, and a related general decrease in modal contributions to thermal conductivity. We find the vibrational phases (acoustic vs. optical) of sodium vibrations to be relatively disordered compared to the network-forming silicon and oxygen species, explaining how increasing Na$_2$O content decreases thermal conductivity. Our work sheds new light on the fundamentals of glassy heat transfer as well as the interplay between thermal conduction and modal characteristics in glasses.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an fanomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries -- called quantum cellular automata (QCA) -- we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases), and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</description>

      <title>Machine learning topological energy braiding of non-Bloch bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has been used to identify phase transitions in a variety of physical systems. However, there is still a lack of relevant research on non-Bloch energy braiding in non-Hermitian systems. In this work, we study non-Bloch energy braiding in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems using unsupervised and supervised methods. In unsupervised learning, we use diffusion maps to successfully identify non-Bloch energy braiding without any prior knowledge and combine it with k-means to cluster different topological elements into clusters, such as Unlink and Hopf link. In supervised learning, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Bloch energy data to predict not only Bloch energy braiding but also non-Bloch energy braiding with an accuracy approaching 100%. By analysing the CNN, we can ascertain that the network has successfully acquired the ability to recognise the braiding topology of the energy bands. The present study demonstrates the considerable potential of machine learning in the identification of non-Hermitian topological phases and energy braiding.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of light by impurities in a solid transparent matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solid transparent medium with randomly positioned, immobile impurity atoms is a promising candidate for observation of Anderson localization of light in three dimensions. It can have low losses and allows for mitigation of the detrimental effect of longitudinal optical fields by an external magnetic field, but it has its own issues: thermal oscillations of atoms around their equilibrium positions and inhomogeneous broadening of atomic spectral lines due to random local electric fields. We show that these complications should not impede observation of Anderson localization of light in such materials. The thermal oscillations hardly affect light propagation whereas the inhomogeneous broadening can be compensated for by increasing the number density of impurity atoms.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing with logistic map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies on reservoir computing essentially involve a high dimensional dynamical system as the reservoir, which transforms and stores the input as a higher dimensional state, for temporal and nontemporal data processing. We demonstrate here a method to predict temporal and nontemporal tasks by constructing virtual nodes as constituting a reservoir in reservoir computing using a nonlinear map, namely the logistic map, and a simple finite trigonometric series. We predict three nonlinear systems, namely Lorenz, Rossler, and Hindmarsh-Rose, for temporal tasks and a seventh order polynomial for nontemporal tasks with great accuracy. Also, the prediction is made in the presence of noise and found to closely agree with the target. Remarkably, the logistic map performs well and predicts close to the actual or target values. The low values of the root mean square error confirm the accuracy of this method in terms of efficiency. Our approach removes the necessity of continuous dynamical systems for constructing the reservoir in reservoir computing. Moreover, the accurate prediction for the three different nonlinear systems suggests that this method can be considered a general one and can be applied to predict many systems. Finally, we show that the method also accurately anticipates the time series of the all the three variable of Rossler system for the future (self prediction).</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Bottlenecks in Quantum Annealing and Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Paramagnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correspondence between long-range interacting quantum spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems underpins the physical motivation for adiabatic quantum computing. On one hand, in disordered (quantum) spin systems, the focus is on exact methods such as the replica trick that allow the calculation of system quantities in the limit of infinite system and ensemble size. On the other hand, when solving a given instance of an optimization problem, disorder-averaged quantities are of no relevance, as one is solely interested in instance-specific, finite-size properties, in particular the true solution. Here, we apply the nonequilibrium Green-function formalism to the spin coherent-state path integral to obtain the statistical fluctuations and the collective-excitation spectrum along the annealing path. For the example of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, by comparing to extensive numerically exact results, we show that this method provides access to the instance-specific bottlenecks of the annealing protocol.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where cells nonlinearly compete for neuronal firing while supressing neighbouring cells.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>

      <title>Thermal signature of helical molecule: Beyond nearest-neighbor electron hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate, for the first time, the thermal signature of a single-stranded helical molecule that is described beyond usual nearest-neighbor electron hopping, by analyzing electronic specific heat. Depending on the hopping of electrons, two different kinds of helical systems are considered. In one case the hopping is confined within a few neighboring lattice sites which is referred to as short-range hopping helix, while in the other case, electrons can hop in all possible sites making the system a long-range hopping one. These two helices accurately emulate the structures of single-stranded DNA and protein molecules, respectively. Each helix geometry is exposed to a transverse electric field applied perpendicular to the helix axis. The interplay among the helicity, higher-order hopping, and the electric field has significant impact on thermal response. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis reveals that, under low-temperature conditions, the short-range hopping helix exhibits greater sensitivity to temperature compared to the long-range hopping helix system. Conversely, the scenario reverses in the high-temperature limit. The thermal response of the helices can be modified selectively by means of the electric field, and the difference between the specific heats of the two helices gradually decreases with increasing the field strength. The molecular handedness, on the other hand, does not have any appreciable effect on the thermal signature. In addition, we also explore a significant application of electronic specific heat (ESH). Finally, we discuss the results of ESH by considering the spin degree of freedom and in the context of real biological helical systems.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedups for quantum walks in random hierarchical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are few known exponential speedups for quantum algorithms and these tend to fall into even fewer families. One speedup that has mostly resisted generalization is the use of quantum walks to traverse the welded-tree graph, due to Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman. We show how to generalize this to a large class of hierarchical graphs in which the vertices are grouped into "supervertices" which are arranged according to a $d$-dimensional lattice. Supervertices can have different sizes, and edges between supervertices correspond to random connections between their constituent vertices.
  The hitting times of quantum walks on these graphs are related to the localization properties of zero modes in certain disordered tight binding Hamiltonians. The speedups range from superpolynomial to exponential, depending on the underlying dimension and the random graph model. We also provide concrete realizations of these hierarchical graphs, and introduce a general method for constructing graphs with efficient quantum traversal times using graph sparsification.</description>

      <title>A simple linear algebra identity to optimize Large-Scale Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural-network architectures have been increasingly used to represent quantum many-body wave functions. These networks require a large number of variational parameters and are challenging to optimize using traditional methods, as gradient descent. Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) has been effective with a limited number of parameters, but becomes impractical beyond a few thousand parameters. Here, we leverage a simple linear algebra identity to show that SR can be employed even in the deep learning scenario. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by optimizing a Deep Transformer architecture with $3 \times 10^5$ parameters, achieving state-of-the-art ground-state energy in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model at $J_2/J_1=0.5$ on the $10\times10$ square lattice, a challenging benchmark in highly-frustrated magnetism. This work marks a significant step forward in the scalability and efficiency of SR for Neural-Network Quantum States, making them a promising method to investigate unknown quantum phases of matter, where other methods struggle.</description>
