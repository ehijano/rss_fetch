      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support decision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further reduce disruption to as low as NZ\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to NZ\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1. When also acknowledging unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>

      <title>Solar Alfvenic Pulses and Mesoscale Solar Wind</title>

Abstract: Large-scale solar ejections are well understood, but the extent to which small-scale solar features directly influence the solar wind remains an open question, primarily due to the challenges of tracing these small-scale ejections and their impact. Here, we measure the fine-scale motions of network bright points along a coronal hole boundary in high-resolution H-alpha images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory to quantify the agitation of open flux tubes into generating Alfvenic pulses. We combine the motion, magnetic flux, and activity duration of the flux tubes to estimate the energy content carried by individual Alfvenic pulses, which is ~10+25 erg, adequately higher than the energies ~10+23 erg estimated for the magnetic switchbacks observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). This implies the possibility that the surface-generated Alfvenic pulses could reach the solar wind with sufficient energy to generate switchbacks, even though some of then are expected to be reflected back in the stratified solar atmosphere. Alfvenic pulses further reproduce for the first time other properties of switchbacks, including the filling factor above ~8% at granular and supergranular scales, which correspond best to the lower end of the mesoscale structure. This quantitative result for solar energy output in the form of Alfvenic pulses through magnetic funnels provides a crucial clue to the ongoing debate about the dynamic cycle of energy exchange between the Sun and the mesoscale solar wind that has been raised, but has not been adequately addressed, by PSP near-Sun observations.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an Inverse Cascade of Magnetic Helicity in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate the cascade direction of the solar wind turbulence, we analyzed magnetic helicity density spectra from the Parker Solar Probe data across more than 500 heliocentric distances. For the first time, we confirmed a persistent inverse cascade extending from the Sun to Mercury's orbital vicinity. This finding challenges the conventional hypothesis that the magnetic helicity density within the inner heliosphere is random. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a radial sign change of the spectral magnetic helicity density at a frequency whose value decreases logarithmically with distance. These results provide new insights into the evolution of solar wind turbulence in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Preferential acceleration of heavy ions in magnetic reconnection: Hybrid-kinetic simulations with electron inertia</title>

Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the energy range 10s KeV/nucleon-100s MeV/nucleon originate from Sun. Their high flux near Earth may damage the space borne electronics and generate secondary radiations harmful for the life on Earth and thus understanding their energization on Sun is important for space weather prediction. Impulsive (or ${}^{3}$He-rich) SEP events are associated with the acceleration of charge particles in solar flares by magnetic reconnection (MR) and related processes. The preferential acceleration of heavy ions and the extra-ordinary abundance enhancement of ${}^3$He in the impulsive SEPs are not understood yet. We study heavy-ion acceleration and their abundance enhancements by MR, an established acceleration source for impulsive SEPs in which heavy-ion enhancement is observed. We simulate MR using a 2-D hybrid-kinetic plasma model (kinetic ions and inertial electron fluid) with all the ions species treated self-consistently. We find that heavy ions are preferentially accelerated to energies many times larger than their initial thermal energies by a variety of acceleration mechanisms operating in MR. Most efficient acceleration takes place in the flux pileup regions of MR. Heavy ions with sufficiently small values of charge to mass ratio ($Q/M$) can be accelerated by pickup mechanism in outflow regions even before any magnetic flux is piled up. The energy spectra of heavy ions develop a shoulder like region, a non-thermal feature, as a result of the acceleration. The spectral index of the power law fit to the shoulder region of the spectra varies approximately as $(Q/M)^{-0.64}$. Abundance enhancement factor, defined as number of particles above a threshold energy normalized to total number of particles, scales as $(Q/M)^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ increases with the energy threshold. We discuss our simulation results in the light of the SEP observations.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Shocks</title>

Abstract: Energetic particles in interplanetary space are normally measured at time scales that are long compared to the ion gyroperiod. Such observations by necessity average out the microphysics associated with the acceleration and transport of 10s - 100s keV particles. We investigate previously unseen non-equilibrium features that only become observable at very high time resolution, and discuss possible explanations of these features. We use unprecedentedly high-time-resolution data that were acquired by the in situ instruments on Solar Orbiter in the vicinity of two interplanetary shocks observed on 2023-11-29 07:51:17 UTC and 2023-11-30 10:47:26 UTC at $\sim 0.83$ astronomical units from the Sun. The solar-wind proton beam population follows the magnetic field instantaneously, on time scales which are significantly shorter than a gyro-period. Energetic particles, despite sampling large volumes of space, vary on remarkably short time scales, typically on the order of the convection time of their gyro-radius. Non-equilibrium features such as bump-on-tail distributions of energetic particles are formed by small-scale magnetic structures in the IMF. High-time-resolution observations show previously unobserved microphysics in the vicinity of two traveling interplanetary shocks, including ion reflection at a current sheet, which may explain where ions are reflected in shock acceleration.</description>
